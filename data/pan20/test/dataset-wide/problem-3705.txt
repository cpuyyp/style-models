I think that I have a compelete answer (but see PS below). Let $\mathcal{M}$ (repectively, $\mathcal{N}$) be the ideal of meager (respectively, Lebesgue null) sets in $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal, and $\mathcal{I}$ be an ideal of sets in $\mathbb{R}$. A set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is $\kappa$-$\mathcal{I}$-Luzin if $|X|\ge\kappa$ but $|X\cap I|<\kappa$ for every set $I\in\mathcal{I}$. In other words, if it has no subset of cardinality $\kappa$ in $\mathcal{I}$. A set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is Luzin (respectively, Sierpi\'nski) if it is $\aleph_1$-$\mathcal{M}$-Luzin (respectively, $\aleph_1$-$\mathcal{N}$-Luzin). cov$(\mathcal{I})$ is the minimal cardinality of a cover of the real line by elements of the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. The following folklore result is easy. Theorem: If cov$(\mathcal{I})={}$cof$(\mathcal{I})$ then there is a cov$(\mathcal{I})$-$\mathcal{I}$-Luzin set. Thus, the answer to Question 1 is "No" if cov$(\mathcal{N})={}$cof$(\mathcal{N})$, and similarly for Question 2. Both hypotheses follow from CH, MA, etc. Lemma. Assume that there is a $\kappa$-$\mathcal{I}$-Luzin set $X$. Then cf$(\kappa)\le{}$cov$(\mathcal{I})$. Indeed, by moving to a subset of $X$ we may assume that $|X|=\kappa$. Let $\{I_\alpha : \alpha<\text{cov}(\mathcal{I})\}$ be a family in $\mathcal{I}$ covering the real line. Then $$X=\bigcup_{\alpha<\text{cov}(\mathcal{I})} X\cap I_\alpha.$$ Thus, $\kappa$ is a union of $\text{cov}(\mathcal{I})$ sets of cardinality smaller than $\kappa$. Theorem (Judah, Shelah): It is consistent that non$(\mathcal{M})={}$non$(\mathcal{N})=\aleph_1$ and there are no Luzin or Sierpi\'nski sets. Moreover, they prove that a Miller real kills the ground model Luzin and Sierpi\'nski set, and iterate with countable support iteration. The consistency result you hoped for follows. Theorem. It is consistent that every set of reals contains a measure-zero subset and a Lebesgue null subset of the same cardinality. Indeed, in Miller's model, non$(\mathcal{M})={}$non$(\mathcal{N})=\aleph_1$ and the continuum is $\aleph_2$. It follows from the Cihon diagram that $\text{cov}(\mathcal{M})=\text{cov}(\mathcal{N})=\aleph_1$ there. By the above lemma, there are no $\aleph_2$-$\mathcal{M}$-Luzin or $\aleph_2$-$\mathcal{N}$-Luzin sets there. By the Judah--Shelah Theorem, there are also no $\aleph_1$-$\mathcal{M}$-Luzin or $\aleph_1$-$\mathcal{N}$-Luzin sets there. PS. I am writing this after an all-night work, I hope I do not mess up things. 

Is it provable, in ZF (without Choice), that every filter can be extended to one of cardinality continuum? The extended filter is not requested to be an ultrafilter. 

An ultrafilter ornament is a chain of free filters on $\mathbb{N}$ that are not ultrafilters, whose union is an ultrafilter. Let $\mathfrak{ufo}$ be the minimal cardinality of an ultrafilter ornament. I arrived at this definition back in 2008, while teaching Ramsey theory at the Weizmann Institute of Science, based on a nice book by I. Protasov. Topologically, the cardinal number $\mathfrak{ufo}$ is the minimal length of a transfinite convergent sequence in $\beta(\mathbb{N})$, but you may proceed with the combinatorial definition if you prefer. Basic facts. 

I initially thought that the following provides a negative answer, and posted this for comments. Will Brian points out below that the last claim is wrong. It may still be useful as a starting point, so I do not delete this answer. In the notation below, one seems to need a family $\mathcal{A}$ that is closed under finite intersections and such that $\mathcal{A}\setminus\{\emptyset\}\subseteq\mathcal{N}$ and every element of $\mathcal{N}$ contains an element of $\mathcal{A}$. A semifilter is a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ such that for each set $A\in\mathcal{F}$, all supersets of $A$ are in $\mathcal{F}$. For a semifilter $\mathcal{F}$, define $$ \mathcal{F}^+:=\{A\subseteq\mathbb{N} : A^c\notin \mathcal{F}\}. $$ Then $\mathcal{F}^+$ is also the family of all sets that intersect all members of the semifilter $\mathcal{F}$. We also have that $\mathcal{F}^{++}=\mathcal{F}$. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the (semi)filter of all density 1 sets, and $\mathcal{N}$ be the family of neighborhoods, i.e., sets containing open sets, in the expected topology. You request that $\mathcal{N}^+=\mathcal{D}$ or, equivalently, that $$ \mathcal{N}=\mathcal{D}^+=\{A\subseteq\mathbb{N} : A^c\notin \mathcal{D}\}, $$ the family of all sets of positive upper density. (And here comes the gap...) But then there are two elements of $\mathcal{N}$ whose intersection is nonempty but has zero density; a contradiction. 

(Joint question with Piotr Szewczak.) Definitions and notation. By filter we mean a filter on $\omega$ containing the cofinite sets at least. For a filter $\mathcal{F}$, let $\mathcal{F}^+:=\{A\subseteq\omega : A^c\notin \mathcal{F}\}$. For an infinite set $A\subseteq\omega$ and a natural number $n$, define $\mathrm{next}(A,n)=\min\{k\in A:n<k\}$. For natural numbers $m<n$, let $[m,n]:=\{m,m+1,\dots,n\}$. The question. Which filters $\mathcal{F}$ we have the following property? 

The answer is "No." This is yet another instance where selection principles are useful. One uses knowledge on more understood, related properties, to answer questions on less understood ones. First, if you allow $I$ to be infinite, then notice that $\mathbb{N}$ (with the discrete topology) satisfies $\binom{\Omega}{\Gamma}$ (and thus your property), but the Baire space $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$ does not satisfy Menger's property $\mathsf{S}_\mathrm{fin}(\mathrm{O},\mathrm{O})$, which is implied by your property. For a product of two spaces, the answer remains "No," by the same method: Todorcevic proved there are (in ZFC) two $\binom{\Omega}{\Gamma}$ spaces whose product is not Lindel\"of, a property weaker than yours. If you wish to restrict to very nice spaces, like real sets, then assuming the Continuum Hypothesis there are two $\binom{\Omega}{\Gamma}$ real sets whose product is not $\mathsf{S}_\mathrm{fin}(\mathrm{O},\mathrm{O})$, see Arnold W. Miller, Boaz Tsaban, Lyubomyr Zdomskyy, Selective covering properties of product spaces, II: $\gamma$~spaces (to appear in TAMS). 

How about the theorem that there are two irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a^b$ rational? Proof. Either $c:=\sqrt{2}^\sqrt{2}$ is rational, or else $c$ is irrational and $c^\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{2}^2=2$ is rational. 

The Frechet filter (of all cofinite sets), and every ultrafilter, have this proeprty. In particular, are there concrete examples of filters that are not Frechet and not uf (and better not the above under a finite-to-one map) but have this property? Update. Blass and Brian provide below examples that are ultrafilters under finite-to-one maps. Our research developed in the meanwhile to see that we need examples that cannot be mapped to the Frechet filter or an ultrafilter by a finite-to-one function. Consistently, as Blass points out, there are no such examples (Filter Dichotomy), so the question is, for example, what can be said if CH holds? More concretely, how prevalent are such examples under CH? Are there "important" examples (i.e., not ones cooked up by transfinite induction for the purpose of the question). Any other axioms relevant for a positive answer? 

For a partially ordered set $P$, a set $A\subseteq P$ is cofinal if for each element of $P$ there is a larger element in $A$. The cofinality of $P$, ${\rm cof}(P)$, is the minimal cardinality of a cofinal family in $P$. Let $\kappa$ be an infinite cardinal number. Consider the set $\mathbb{N}^\kappa$ of all functions from $\kappa$ to $\mathbb{N}$ (equivalently, $\kappa$-sequences of natural numbers), with the pointwise partial order: $f\le g$ if $f(\alpha)\le g(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha<\kappa$. Let $$f(\kappa):={\rm cof}(\mathbb{N}^\kappa,\le).$$ The cardinal $f(\aleph_0)$ is the well-understood dominating number $\mathfrak{d}$, which is consistently any cardinal of uncountable cofinality that is not larger than the continuum (see Blass). Basic facts include: 

Aurichi proved that Every Menger space is D. The last two properties imply Menger, so they imply D. On the other hand, Menger's property does not imply $\Omega \choose \text{T}$, for example since the latter is equivalent to $S_{fin}(\Omega,\text{T})$ (Details are available here) and thus implies $S_{fin}(\Omega,\Omega)$, which is the same as Menger's property in all finite powers. In summary, we have the following implications $${\Omega \choose \Gamma}\Rightarrow{\Omega \choose \text{T}}\Rightarrow D$$ and the last implication is not reversible. The question whether the first implication is actually an equivalence is one of the most notorious and important open problems in the field of selection principles.

What is the minimal cardinality of a family of sets of real numbers, each of positive Lebesgue measure, such that every set of real numbers of positive Lebesgue measure contains some member of the family as a subset? One may work in the Cantor space if desired, and chose compact sets as elements of the family. In particular, the answer is not above the continuum. If this happens to be a known combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum, that would be an acceptable answer, of course. 

Is there a simple reason why uncountable compact sets of real numbers have cardinality continuum? I know that this is immediate from the Cantor-Bendixon Theorem, but I wonder whether this consequence in its own can be proved in a simpler/shorter manner. Perhaps building a Cantor set inside the compact set is one answer to my question, but even this is not so trivial if you did not see similar things before (many small assertions need to be proved in such a case). I wonder if there are better approaches. The question is relevant for a survey paper I write, where going into the CB Theorem (just for the mentioned purpose) may distract the attention of the reader off the main thread of the paper. 

The sets you defined are called meager-additive, and the family of these sets is sometimes denoted $\mathcal{M}^\star$. Google suggests a good number of references, and I recommend you also look at Barotszynski and Judah's set theory book. It must contain a combinatorial characterization of the kind you seek. BTW, the result of Ballone that you cite is awesome! 

More precisely, is it conistently not in the lattice generated by the known combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum by maxima and minima? More concretely, are the inequalities $\max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} <\mathfrak{bidi}$ and $\mathfrak{bidi}<\min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\} $ each consistent? 

The following question arose in a joint project with Arkadius Kalka and Adi Ben-Zvi. Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a finite field, and $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ be the $n\times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}$. For a set of matrices $\mathcal{F}\subseteq M_n(\mathbb{F})$, let $\mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{F})$ be the subalgebra of $M_n(\mathbb{F})$ generated by $\mathcal{F}$. Let $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\subseteq M_n(\mathbb{F})$ be sets of matrices. Question: Assume that the intersection algebra $\mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{A})\cap \mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{B})$ is much smaller than each of the algebras $\mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{B})$. What is the most efficient way to compute the intersection $\mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{A})\cap \mbox{Alg}(\mathcal{B})$? Is there a substantially more efficient approach than computing Echelonized bases for the spans (as vector spaces) of the productive semigroups generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ and then solving the appropriate system of linear equations? (A base can be computed by carrying out, in each step, one multiplication by an element of $\mathcal{A}$ and Echelonizing with respect to the part of the basis available thus far.) Comments: We are, in fact, interested in the following situation. If this helps in finding a better algorithm, that would be just as good. 

For cardinal numbers $\kappa\le\mu$, we have that $f(\kappa)\le f(\mu)$: A projection of a cofinal family in $\mathbb{N}^\mu$ on the first $\kappa$ corrdinates is cofinal in $\mathbb{N}^\kappa$. $\kappa<f(\kappa)$: Given $\{h_\alpha:\alpha<\kappa\}\subseteq\mathbb{N}^\kappa$, define $h(\alpha):=h_\alpha(\alpha)+1$ for all $\alpha<\kappa$. The value of $f(\kappa)$ with "$\le$" replaced by eventual dominance remains the same (see Comfort). 

Guess. My guess is that the answer (to all questions) is "Yes", but I would be happier if it turns out to be "No." Motivation. A topological space is Menger if for each countable family of open covers of that space, there are finite subsets of the open covers that together cover the space. This property was introduced by Menger in 1924, and in this form by Hurewicz (1925). It found numerous connections and applications to various branches of mathematics, even to additive Ramsey theory. A famous and notorious open problem asks whether, consistently, the square of every Menger set of real numbers is Menger. In a joint work with Piotr Szewczak, we proved that if $\mathfrak{bidi}=\mathfrak{d}$, then there is a Menger set of real numbers whose square is not Menger. Such a result was earlier known under the stronger hypothesis $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})=(\mathfrak{d}=)\mbox{cof}(\mathcal{M})$. A survey of the standard models. Following are comments about $\mathfrak{bidi}$ in models obtained by adding standard generic reals (usually, $\aleph_2$ many) to a model of CH. The Cohen model. $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})=\mathfrak{c}$, so $\mathfrak{bidi}=\mathfrak{c}$, too. The Random reals model. $\mathfrak{d}=\aleph_1$, and thus $\mathfrak{bidi}=\aleph_1$. The Sack model. Rarely a good model to separate cardinals of this kind, since all classic cardinals are $\aleph_1$ there. The Dominating reals (Hechler) model, the Laver model, the Mathias model. $\mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{c}$, so $\mathfrak{bidi}=\mathfrak{c}$. Miller's model. $\mathfrak{r}=\aleph_1$, and thus $\mathfrak{bidi}=\aleph_1$. Mildenberger suggests that adding Miller reals and then random reals may result in $\max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} < \min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\}$. What is $\mathfrak{bidi}$ in this model? (I guess that adding enough random reals to any model of $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})<\mathfrak{d}$ wound render $\max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} < \min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\}$.) 

We believe the answer to the following question, that is relevant to a joint research project with Piotr Szewczak, should be known. We would appreciate any help or pointer. Needed definitions may be found in, e.g., Blass's chapter in the Handbook of Set Theory. For $f\in\omega^\omega$, let $K_f:=\{g\in \omega^\omega : g\le^* f\}$. Let $\mathfrak{tmp}$ be the minimal cardinality of a set $Y\subseteq \omega^\omega$ such that the set $\bigcup_{f\in Y}K_f$ is not meager. Since every set $K_f$ is meager, we have that $\mathfrak{b}\le \mathfrak{tmp}\le \mathrm{non}(meager)$. Is $\mathfrak{tmp}$ (provably) equal to either of these cardinals? 

The question may be answered in the comments. I thus collect the relevant comments here as an answer. C. Conley: The collection of functions with finite support (that is, those which are zero on a cofinite set) forms an ideal not contained in any of the maximal ideals listed in the question. D. Somerset: Perhaps $Ba_1(X)$ is a commutative C*-algebra, and thus a PM-ring. Update: Y. Choi comments below that Somerset's approach does not work, since one is considering all the Baire-1 functions, not just the bounded ones. 

$\aleph_1\le\mathfrak{ufo}\le\mathfrak{c}$. $\mathfrak{ufo}$ is a regular cardinal number. $\mathfrak{ufo}\le\mathfrak{u}$, indeed $\mathfrak{ufo}\le\operatorname{cof}(\kappa)$ for each cardinality $\kappa$ of a basis for an ultrafilter. 

To help with @Student's last comment, I post here Baillif's answer. The proof is very short, actually: given the sequence $\epsilon_i$, let $U_i$ be the cover of $X$ by open intervals of length $\epsilon_i$. Then $S_1(O,O)$ ensures that there is a cover of $X$ consisting of (at most) one member of each $U_i$. A more general statement is proved in Theorem 9 in "Finite powers of strong measure zero sets" by M. Scheepers. – Mathieu Baillif
