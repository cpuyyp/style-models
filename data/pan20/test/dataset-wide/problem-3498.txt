Economists would stress that one explanation among others is Parents' income: Opportunity cost of child-rearing time is high for high income/education mothers. They are other reasons. David de la Croix works on this topic and offers interesting lectures on Fertility, Education, Growth and Sustainability here. You will find references for the above facts and other reasons for the decline in fertility. An academic reference is: De la Croix D. and M. Doepke, Inequality and growth: why differential fertility matters, American Economic Review, 93, 1091-1113, 2003. 

The omitted variable bias in gravity model is an important issue given that some factors are unobserved or difficult to quantity. To solve this issue trade economists tend to rely on various fixed effect estimators. But, the question is what is your variable of interest? Exporter-by-year and importer-by-year fixed effects For instance, if you are interested in evaluating the effect of trade costs on trade, you can introduce exporter-by-year and importer-by-year fixed effects to absorb GDP, GDP per capita, price indexes etc. Exporter-by-importer fixed effects If you are interested in evaluating the effect of one country-specific variable on trade, you can introduce exporter-by-importer fixed effects to absorb distance or contiguity effects. Exporter-by-year, importer-by-year + exporter-by-importer fixed effects If you are interested in evaluating the effect of a time-varying bilateral factor, like free trade agreements, on trade (see Baier and Bergstrand, 2007), you can introduce exporter-by-year, importer-by-year + exporter-by-importer fixed effects to absorb distance or contiguity effects as well as GDP, GDP per capita, ....

Is it common in Economics to send your paper, without an explicit invitation, asking for feedback (assuming the speaker to be in the relevant field)? I am not sure this is common in Econ but I have definitely done it! Note that you increase the probability of getting feedback if 

As a non macro-economist, I am wondering if this is true? Is there any clear evidence on this relationship? Higher growth may lead to higher demand and inflation but I guess this happens only if supply does not adjust and prices are not sticky. The reverse causality running from inflation to economic growth does not seem to have much empirical support due to identification issues. 

So, this result complicates the implementation of simple and one-dimensional policies. However, their model and methods can be used to evaluate various policies. For example, imposing a tax on sugar or on fat. It's worth a try. 

In his Family Tree of Trade Economists Alan Deardoff indicates some links between teachers, students and academic siblings. I guess that "teacher" includes "advisor", but probably more. 

the apartment could also be furnished or designed specifically for rich people (product differentiation); the given price could be a base price subject to harsh negotiation; locals may have access to better information on the rental market and may find better opportunities.

This question also reminds me a new term coined by Ed. Leamer, neuro-facturing, in opposition to manu-facturing. So, the future is not about a stable manufacturing job but the kind of work that depends on how original your ideas can be, and how much you can master technology. However, I don't remember any reference. If someone does, please, let me know. 

My understanding is that the gravity equation can be derived from different settings. You can assume that each country 1/ produces only one product. This is knwon as the "Armington assumption" as in Armington (1969) and allows a simple derivation of the gravity equation as in Anderson and Van Wincoop (2003). 2/ is specialized in different products (or varieties of a product, given that each variety of a good counts as a distinct product). This is the case worked out by Feenstra, where products are differentiated by their country of origin. So, each country produces many distinct products. Then the question is to know if the number of products is fixed, as in Armington (1969), or endogeneous and varies due to free entry, as in the monopolistic competition models. References 

In the trade literature, most of the theoretical papers assume balanced trade, which implies simple market clearing conditions. Typically, output for a given country is equal to the amount spent on good purchased from all other destinations. However, R. Dekle, J. Eaton, and S. Kortum, in a paper called Unbalanced trade (2007), present a new approcah to international trade. They incorporate imbalances into a quantitative model of bilateral trade, calculating how relative factor costs and welfare would change if current accounts were all balanced. While the exercise does not point to what policy would eliminate imbalances, it does suggest the magnitude of the long-run adjustments that such a policy would entail. 

The Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) of the Census provides annual measures of business dynamics (such as job creation and destruction, establishment births and deaths, and firm startups and shutdowns) for the economy and aggregated by establishment and firm characteristics. The use of the LBD as its source data permits tracking establishments and firms over time. In particular, BDS provides information on Establishment openings and closings and Number of startups and firm shutdowns. The following figure is based on BDS and from Haltiwanger, John, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, (2009) "Business Dynamics Statistics: An Overview". 

World Trade Organization (WTO) rules prohibit export subsidies and China joined the WTO almost 15 years ago (in December 2001). As a condition of membership, China had to eliminate export subsidies in the late 90s. So, strictly speaking, China can't subsidize its exports. However, Dani Rodrik considers that China subsidizes them indirectly through the exchange rate by maintaining an undervalued currency (here and here). Rodrik adds two interesting thoughts. First, the undervalued currency boosts China's growth and this, in turn, is good for the world's recovery and the alleviation of poverty. Second, China could maintain its growth without trade imbalances if it could introduce industrial subsidies to offset a rising yuan. So, it be would better to subsidise tradables directly than to subsidise them indirectly through the exchange rate.

A new book just came out by two well known development economists, Alain de Janvry and Elisabeth Sadoulet, Development Economics Theory and practice (2016). Abstract: Development Economics: Theory and Practice provides students and practitioners with the perspectives and the tools they need to think analytically and critically about the current major economic development issues in the world. Alain de Janvry and Elisabeth Sadoulet identify seven key dimensions of development; growth, poverty, vulnerability, inequality, basic needs, sustainability, and quality of life, and use them to structure the contents of the text. This book gives a historical perspective on the evolution of thought in development. It uses theory and empirical analysis to present readers with a full picture of how development works, how its successes and failures can be assessed, and how alternatives can be introduced. The authors demonstrate how diagnostics, design of programs and policies, and impact evaluation can be used to seek new solutions to the suffering and violence caused by development failures. This text is fully engaged with the most cutting edge research in the field, and equips readers with analytical tools for the impact evaluation of development programs and policies, illustrated with numerous examples. It is underpinned throughout by a wealth of student-friendly features including case studies, quantitative problem sets, end-of-chapter questions, and extensive references. 

Masahisa Fujita is considered as one of the most famous theorist in urban economics. He is one of the pioneers of the New Economic Geography. His book Urban Economic Theory: Land Use and City Size, 1989, Cambridge is a master piece, laying down the theoretical foundations of urban economics. Also, you may read 

The total retail market for cocaine amounts to some US $85 billion in 2009 (p.70). Columbian production proxied in terms of hectares is around 89% (based on 2009's estimates (68,000+73,000)/158,800 - Table 12). 

Esteban Rossi-Hansberg from Princeton is a rising star in urban economics. You may check out his syllabus, which is pretty useful. He does not recommend any textbook, and provides a more modern approach. 

Here is David Autor's TEDx Why are there still so many jobs? and I will have added [despite automation] Autor's answer is that technology magnifies the importance of our expertise and creativity and since we never get enough the wealth and the time saved by automation boost our endless inventiveness. So, automation will NOT replace EVERY job by robots. There's always new work to do. The challenge that this automation phenomenon creates, what economists call job polarization, is that it knocks out rungs in the economic ladder, and shrinks the size of the middle class. The share of employment in occupations in the middle of the skill distribution has declined rapidly in the US and Europe. At the same time the share of employment at the upper and lower ends of the occupational skill distribution has increased substantially. A compelling explanation of this job polarization is that middle-skilled manufacturing and clerical occupations are characterized by a high intensity of procedural, rule-based activities which they call "routine tasks", which can relatively easily be coded into computer programs (see Autor, Levy, and Murnane, QJE, 2003). 

In this interesting paper, Caplan, 2001 talks about Conscientiousness, which is a measure of motivation and diligence. 

Note that the concept of Opportunity Cost is used in order to compare a choice to the direct benefit of alternative choices. How do we go about using it in Economics? See here. Regarding a convex Production Possibility Frontier and opportunity costs, you can find helpful examples on the Internet. Here is one 

As far as I understand, in the international economics field, "costs of travel to buy goods" are considered as trade costs. According to Anderson and van Wincoop (2004), p. 691-2 

One reason could be price discrimination. For instance, the same apartment is not rented the same price for locals vs (rich) foreigners. Other potential reasons: 

This reminds me of the Ponzi Scheme: A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the operator. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent (source wikipedia with numerous examples).
