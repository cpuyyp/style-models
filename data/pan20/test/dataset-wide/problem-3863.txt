I know of two ways to make a canonical or somewhat canonical fundamental domain of a geometric group action. 1) A discrete reflection group of hyperbolic isometries (or a discrete reflection group in any isotropic geometry in any dimension) has a canonical fundamental domain bounded by its reflection walls. If you pass to a subgroup of a reflection group, then as you say you can stitch together copies of the small fundamental domain to make a larger one. $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is half of a reflection group $\Gamma$, and this could be the main motivation for standard choices for its fundamental domain. The same fundamental domain is also the triangle of another reflection group, one which is a different index 2 subgroup of this $\Gamma$. 2) The Voronoi tiling of a free orbit of a group $\Gamma$ always gives you a Voronoi fundamental domain, as you say. Even if your favorite orbit is not free, you can interpret it as a limit of free orbits and take the limit of the Voronoi tilings. Even though the standard fundamental domain of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ might not be a Voronoi domain, I think that it is a limiting Voronoi domain, obtained by taking $z_0 \to \infty$ or $z_0 \to 0$ along the imaginary axis. 

First, a more standard name for what you call "geometrical distance" is Euclidean distance, although your name also arises. "Topological distance" is a very problematic name; I think that "combinatorial distance" is a clearer and more standard name for distance defined by the number of edges. My guess is that your property does not have a standard name. However, it is closely related to a property that does have a standard name. The combinatorial distance is usually bounded by a relatively small integer; for instance, it is 2 in a cross polytope in any dimension. A set is more generally called a $k$-distance set if it only has $k$ distinct Euclidean distances. The conventional thinking is that $k$-distance sets are a good level of generality, although I have no idea whether conventional thinking on this point is wise or unwise. I found a an article on $k$-distance sets in normed spaces by Konrad Swanepoel which has an interesting mini-bibliography of the Euclidean case. Maybe Konrad can say more since he is a regular user of MO. My suggestion is to make a name like "edge-determined few-distance set" to convey your idea. Even if there is a name that has appeared in a few papers, it is not necessarily a good name. I concede that it there already is a standard name in many papers, you should probably use it; but I checked a bit and I didn't see one. Also, there is a more general class of examples than those that people have suggested so far. Any Cartesian product of regular simplices with unit edges is an example. This includes the $n$-cube, the $n$-simplex, and the triangular prism as special cases. 

In both physics and mathematics, there are times when you want a signed multiple integral $dx \wedge dy$, and there are times when you want its unsigned counterpart $dx\;dy = |dx \wedge dy|$. The difference is that in physics, the notation $dx \wedge dy$ is typically paraphrased either with cross products or with antisymmetric indices. The exterior algebra of differential forms is a brilliant definition due to Elie Cartan. Physicists sometimes need ideas that are equivalent to Cartan's work in this topic, but in most areas of physics they simply didn't adopt his notation. One major exception is string theorists and certain gauge theorists, who by now understand Cartan perfectly well. For example, the most elegant way to understand a surface integral, as you see it in Ampere's law or Stokes' theorem, is as a signed integral. It is the integral of a differential form $$\omega(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)) = f(u,v) du \wedge dv$$ over a surface. But you can instead write it as the surface integral of a vector field $\vec{\omega} \cdot (\vec{du} \times \vec{dv})$. Any physicist can tell you that it's a signed integral; the only thing missing is Cartan's notation. A related example is Maxwell's equations. In low energy physics you write them as four equations with 3-vectors. In high-energy physics you write them as one or two equations with 4-vectors and 4-tensors with indices. You can also write the same equation using differential forms, but only gauge theorists and string theorists feel that they need that notation. On the other hand, a mathematician who wants to use a probability density function or find an unsigned area or volume is perfectly happy to integrate with respect to $dx\;dy = |dx \wedge dy|$. Given other examples such as $ds = \sqrt{|dx|^2+|dy|^2}$ and $|dx \wedge dy|^p$, there is also a shift in emphasis: In more elementary use of Leibniz notation, the differentials are meant more as instructions for what kind of integral you are doing. In Cartan's notation, and in these other unsigned variations, the differentials become objects in their own right, basically what physicists would recognize as tensor fields with special transformation laws. 

The paper On the differentiation of convex functions in finite and infinite dimensional spaces by Zajíček primarily deals with the general question in Banach space, but it looks like it has a summary of the situation (as of 1979) that tells you everything that you might want to know. It has references to closer papers by Anderson-Klee and Besicovitch. I just Googled around and eventually got to this paper. 

Here also is a more orthodox combinatorial generalization of the Birkhoff theorem, and also another case that I once encountered that is between a generalization and a non-generalization. Since Gil now offers a bounty, maybe it's better to merge this answer with the other one. A doubly stochastic matrix can be interpreted as a flow through a directed graph, with unit capacities. (See Unimodular matrix in Wikipedia; I learned about this long ago from Jesus de Loera.) Any such graph has a polytope of flows, called a network flow polytope. Any network flow polytope has integer vertices, because it is a totally unimodular polytope. A totally unimodular polytope is a polytope whose facets have integer equations, and with the property that any maximal, linearly independent collection of facets intersects in an integer point because their matrix has determinant $\pm 1$. In particular the vertices are such intersections, so the vertices are all integral. This is a vast generalization of Birkhoff's theorem that comes from generalizing one of the proofs of Birkhoff's theorem. Example: An alternating-sign matrix is equivalent to a square ice orientation of a square grid. The square ice orientations can be defined by a network flow, so you obtain an alternating-sign-matrix polytope. The generalized Birkhoff theorem in this case says that every vertex of the polytope is an alternating-sign matrix, in fact that every integer point of the $n$-dilated polytope is a sum of $n$ alternating-sign matrices. 

The standard name for this type of relation between two structures on $X$ is concordance rather than homotopy. If two structures on $X$ are isotopic (with the respect to the appropriate homeomorphism group), then they are concordant, but not necessarily vice versa. In some cases you can also assign a separate meaning to homotopy, but I don't think that it means the same thing as concordance. There are then two levels to your question. A triangulation $T$ of $X$ induces a piecewise linear structure $\mathcal{P}$. You could ask whether the PL structures $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}'$ are isotopic or concordant, without worrying about the original triangulations. For simplicity suppose that $X$ is a closed manifold. Then at least in dimension $n \ge 5$, Kirby-Siebenmann theory says that the set of PL structures on $X$ up to isotopy are an affine space (or torsor) of $H^3(X,\mathbb{Z}/2)$. I think that the concordance answer is the same, because the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant comes from the stable germ-theoretic tangent bundle of $X$. In other words, two PL structures give you two different sections of a bundle on $X$ whose fiber is $\text{TOP}(n)/\text{PL}(n)$, the group of germs of homeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ divided by the subgroup of germs of PL homeomorphisms. Stabilization in this case means replacing $n$ by $\infty$ by adding extra factors of $\mathbb{R}$. If $n = 4$, then up to isotopy there are lots of PL structures on many 4-manifolds, as established by gauge theory. But I think that the concordance answer is once again Kirby-Siebenmann. (I learned about this stuff in a seminar given by Rob Kirby — I hope that I remembered it correctly! You can also try the reference by Kirby and Siebenmann, although it is not very easy to read.) There is a coarser answer than the one that I just gave. I tacitly assumed that the triangulations not only give you a PL structure (which always happens), but that they specifically give you a PL manifold structure, with the restriction that the link of every vertex is a PL sphere. These are called "combinatorial triangulations". It is a theorem of Edwards and Cannon that $S^5$ and other manifolds also have non-combinatorial triangulations. If your question is about these, then it is known that they are described by some quotient of Kirby-Siebenmann theory, but it is not known how much you should quotient. It is possible that every manifold of dimension $n \ge 5$ has a non-combinatorial triangulation, and that PL structures are always concordant in this weaker sense. It is known that you should quotient more than trivially, that there are manifolds that have a non-combinatorial triangulation but no PL structure. (I think.) The other half of the question is to give $X$ a distinguished PL structure $\mathcal{P}$, and to look at triangulations $T$ and $T'$ that are both PL with respect to $\mathcal{P}$. In this case there are two good sets of moves to convert $T$ to $T'$. First, you can use stellar moves and their inverses. A stellar move consists of adding a vertex $v$ to the interior of a simplex $\Delta$ (of some dimension) and supporting structure to turn the star of $\Delta$ into the star of $v$. The theorem that these moves suffice is called the stellar subdivision theorem. (The theorem is due to Alexander and Newman and it is explained pretty well in the book by Rourke and Sanderson.) The other set of moves are specific to manifolds and they are the bistellar moves or Pachner moves. One definition is that a bistellar move is a stellar move that adds a vertex $v$ plus a different inverse stellar move that removes $v$ (hence the name). But a clearer definition is that in dimension $n$, a bistellar move replaces $k$ simplices by $n-k+1$ simplices in the minimal way, given by a local $n+1$ concordance that consists of attaching a single $n+1$-dimensional simplex. The theorem that these moves work is due to Pachner. Pachner's moves in particular give you a shellable triangulation of $X \times [0,1]$. Even though the bistellar moves are motivated by concordance and the stellar moves are not, it is not hard to make concordance triangulations for stellar moves as well.
