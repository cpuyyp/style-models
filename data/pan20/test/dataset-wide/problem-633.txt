The one step I didn't follow in the Bike Radar article was drilling a hole in the bottom bracket shell. I couldn't bring myself to put a hole in my nice new frame even though its not a flash one. I suspect plugging all holes before ever ridding may negate the need for this but I will inspect the bottom bracket shell after a few very wet rides. If you do drill a hole remember this will open the frame up to rust so paint it or varnish it. Finally keep on to of scratches. I usually apply clear nail varnish as you can never get a perfect colour matched paint. I hope this helps. 

Really, it's all about your core. Your legs need leverage to push the pedals, and that comes from your core. Crunches are probably the best exercise you can do to improve your cycling. You help stabilize your core with your back and arms, so put a pull up bar in a doorway, and do pull ups. That's all you need to do. You definitely don't need to do a weight routine. You don't even have to get fancy. Back in the day when I was a serious cyclist, I was doing 200 crunches and 40 pull-ups almost every day. Half in the morning, half in the evening. That's a little extreme for most people, but I was a little extreme back then. 

Stuck a large rubber bung in the base of the steerer column to prevent water entering here (even though I have mudguards). I had to shorten the bung slightly to prevent it showing. My saddle clamp encloses the top of the seat post if this wasn't the case I would fill this in a similar manner. This is something I have done on all my frames for the last 20 or more years. Filled every bolt hole with a bolt ensuring ample waterproof grease was applied to the threads. Teflon grease is not great at this I find it gets washed out easily. Marine grease is much better, I use Unipart Marine but there are loads available; they are all considerably cheaper than any proprietary bike grease and I use mine for most applications (hubs, headsets etc) and it last much longer between applications (I commute every day in all weathers). Filled all drain holes as described in step 3 of the Bike Radar winter proofing article. For my frame match sticks were way too small. I used chopsticks, I found snipping approx 3-5 mm off the end and then cutting 5 mm of chopstick was a perfect fit and pretty flush to the frame. Before pushing into the hole I coated in the wood in clear nail varnish (not mine) and then again over the top and overlapping slightly onto the frame once inserted. This varnish prevents water absorption and helps create a seal without using glue. Finally before fitting the bottom bracket I coated the threads of the shell and its interior with the waterproof grease even though already sprayed with Waxoyl. 

Don't forget that there is money involved! Every competition in the TDF has a cash prize. Every sprint. Every categorized mountain. Often towns along the way will have their own prizes, such as a cow, or your weight in champagne. Every team wants to take home some of the spoils, but you can't win if you don't play, so teams that aren't winning stages or jerseys will make sure they have guys in the breaks. 

Standing up on a bike, especially when you lack fitness, is a good way to go "anaerobic." Put simply, that means your body is working so hard, it can't get enough oxygen. You can only do that for a short amount of time, which for most people is in the range of 10-30 seconds. Then the lactic acid build up in your muscles becomes too painful and you are forced to ease up. The solution is simple. You need more strength and fitness. If you like to ride fast and/or climb hills, you can't avoid the anaerobic zone completely, but you can move it a little farther away by getting good fitness. Keep riding, and keep riding hills. 

I agree with Snikrs and also ride a steel fixed gear frame in often wet UK. I recently purchased my current frame (upgrade the old one didn't rust through) and before using it sprayed the inside of the frame with Waxoyl but if I had been able to find it in the UK would probably have used J.P. Weigle's Frame Saver which many people swear by. What I don't like about Waxoyl is it remains quite slimy, I'm not sure if it would be good in a hot climate but it would be better than nothing. You have to be careful in the seat post area and clean it out to allow the frame to grip the seat post. But if done with care its not an issue. I usually just wipe the seat post with an old greasy rag to prevent it sticking in the frame. It is also important to move the seat post every now and again (3 months maybe) as a stuck seat post can be really hard to remove. The other precautions I took before riding the frame were: 

If it's a multi-way stop and there's another car waiting or just arriving, I stop. If I can't clearly see or judge what I'm riding into, I stop. If it doesn't feel right for some reason, I stop. If there's a cop there (or a history of cops), I stop. 

Those are paired spokes, and there's a reason they pair them up. If that was a rear wheel, I might ride it a mile or two if I had to. But not a front wheel. I'm really curious how you managed to break five spokes in one 90 degree section of that wheel. That's not normal behavior. There is something really wrong with that wheel. 

I have a set of Avid Shorty 4 cantilever brakes, well two sets (front and back) and wish to upgrade the pads. These are centre pull, linear pull brakes and have brake pads which are mounted from the centre, ie the post (which is threaded) is centred in the pad. Looking for new pads I see that there is a much wider variety of v-brake pads than cantilever pads. As v-brakes are a subset of cantilever brakes can I use v-brake blocks with my cantilever brakes? I note these tend to have more brake pad at the back of the mounting post than at the front of the pad. I would also like if possible cartridge mounted pads any recommendations would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

To do 528 miles through the desert, in monsoon season, in less than a week is going to be quite an ordeal. You are looking at averaging 75 miles a day to do it in 7 days. You'll be out alone, in the middle of nowhere. I won't say you can't do it, because it can be done. But it's clear you've never done anything of this magnitude. Lots of posts have given you good advice. My advice is to shorten the route. Take the train or bus, or bum a ride as close as you can get to the Arizona border. Cut your distance in half, and your odds of being successful improve dramatically.
