(Emphasis mine.) Simply put, there is no consensus. Meta-analyses already include several studies on the subject so if said meta-analyses have conflicting outcomes this shows clearly that we don’t know either way. On the other hand, I don’t know much about the respective qualities of these studies so it may well be that the analyses are very different in quality. 

I want to know: is this claim true? Have these experiments any scientific value whatsoever (were they performed rigorously, did they test hypotheses, did they result in new insights?), and are they used in modern medicine. The second, stronger claim might not be falsifiable (too conspiracy-ey?) so feel free to disregard that in your answer, though if somebody does have a definitive answer here, I’d appreciate that. 

(The numbers differ slightly from those in Avi’s answer since I’m using the “42%” number from the question to calculate abortions but the principle doesn’t change.) 

In addition to the meta-analyses Oddthinking reported on, there’s also the US Surgeon General’s report from 2006: 

Meaning, unless you can provide sufficient evidence to the contrary – which is vague and subject to interpretation – and no evidence to the contrary exists “beyond a reasonable doubt”, you can be presumed to possess the key. Ignore condition (b) (which on the face of it helps the accused), because condition (a) also needs to fulfilled: Even if the police cannot prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that you have a key, you still need to provide “sufficient evidence of that fact” (= “not in possession of a key”). This is a direct reversal of the burden of proof and the principle of innocent until proven guilty. It is telling that the whole paragraph is written from the default assumption of guilt. 

This TEDx talk about coffee claims that coffee is the #1 source of anti-oxidants in the US diet. Is this true? 

No official recognition of a slave by the name Jenkins is made. Any further claim that the true/hidden reason has to do with a slave would be a question of motivation, and therefore off-topic here. 

However, I question the study's methods. It appears the study was done instantaneously, and did not measure the results of caffeine intake over time. Therefore, it seems at least plausible to me, that the correlation between breast size and coffee intake may be secondary, and there may not be a cause/effect relationship. Perhaps women with smaller breasts have a biological or social reason for stronger coffee cravings, for instance. It also seems possible that even if caffeine does affect breast size, it might happen during puberty, and the caffeine might cause breasts not to develop as fully. Yet the article claims that caffeine can actually cause breast shrinkage, not just under-development. Is there additional research (or a better summary of this study) which confirms the reported claims that drinking coffee does cause breasts to shrink in size? 

Spy movies and novels have popularized the idea that CIA agents, or other spies, will carry cyanide pills, or other "quick and painless" suicide devices with them on covert missions, to use as a last resort to avoid torture in case of enemy capture. Does anyone actually do this? If so, have such measures ever actually been taken (that we know of)? 

Elastic therapeutic tape, better known as kinesio tape, has become ubiquitous in sporting events, notably after the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing, and again in 2012 in London. 

“A is a gene for X” is a shortcut used by scientists when they actually mean to say “gene A modifies the expression of X, all other things being equal.” [1] In particular, it means that an allele of gene A influences X compared to another allele of the same gene. This means that if you hear “gene A accounts for x% of trait T” then what is really meant is that “gene A accounts for x% of the difference in expression of trait T, all other things being equal”. On the flip side, this means that if x% of some trait are determined by genes then the rest of the variability comes from outside factors, such as nutrition. [1]: see for example Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene 

We sometimes hear claims that the results from those experiments have fundamentally influenced our modern understanding of human physiology. For instance, the data from the Nazi experiments on hypothermia are sometimes cited in medical literature [2, 3], although it’s been deemed “unscientific” by others. A stronger claim is that in fact, all modern text books on physiology incorporate fundamental facts which were gained through these experiments. That is, modern physiology is, at least in some regards, fundamentally dependent on these experiments (since they cannot be repeated). For instance: 

Cucumbers, like all matter, are made up of, uh... matter. And all matter has properties of thermal conductivity which dictate how quickly heat will move through the matter. The thermal conductivity of a cucumber is incidentally reported at 0.62 W/m K. This means that it will always take some time for heat to penetrate from the outside of the cucumber to the center of the cucumber. If the outside air temperature rises quickly enough, then the inside of the cucumber will, at some point, be 20 degrees lower than the outside air temperature--same as with any other matter. 

A news piece by KWCH 12 in Wichita Kansas about a local community voting on whether to cease water fluoridation quotes local dentist, Doctor Allison Lesko, as saying: 

The "source" mentioned in the image doesn't have any results when I search for "Elvis", and all of the info I do find there doesn't actually show any sources for any of their claims. Did this happen? For bonus points, what was the resolution? (Did the limo company agree to sell the limo to Elvis to gift to the driver, etc?) 

Energy content Coffee contains in the range of 0.25 calorie per ounce to 0.5 calorie per ounce. A 250g (8.8oz) serving of Red Bull contains 110 calories for about 12.5 calories per ounce. Conclusion: Red Bull contains 25x to 50x more energy per ounce than coffee. Caffeine Content While not energy, caffeine has an "energetic" affect on people. Coffee contains anywhere from 80-130mg per 6 oz for 13.3mg/oz to 21.6mg/oz. Red Bull contains 80mg of caffeine per 8.46oz can for about 9.5mg per ounce. Conclusion: Red Bull contains 30% to 56% less caffeine per ounce than coffee Other notes How strongly you brew your coffee will change the energy content, but even a "double-strong" batch of coffee would only contain 1 calorie per ounce, giving Red Bull 12.5x more energy per ounce than coffee. And if you add cream or sugar to your coffee, then the energy content of the coffee will change, drastically altering the ratio against Red Bull. Red Bull contains other "active ingredients" that exist in different quantities and in some case don't exist at all in coffee, and have the purported effect of altering the mood/energetic feeling of those who consume it. Because Red Bull and Coffee are such different substances, it is impossible to make a direct, objective comparison. 

Now, the Friendly Atheist articles are generally well researched and thus believable, but this one is less so. For one thing, most of its references are to entirely unspecific (or not accessible) “Google Books” searches that prove nothing. Furthermore, the claim that there are no legitimate records is directly contradicted by the Wikipedia article above, which cites several references by contemporaries, such as Tacitus and Tertullian. Another article claims that the persecution lasted three centuries and was witnessed by several historians. All this directly contradicts the claim that “there are zero authentic accounts … until over a century after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire”, because that happened after the three centuries of persecution. It also contradicts a quote taken from The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom (by Candida Moss, published in 2013): 

That said, 3D printers like shown in the vide exist. The German branch of the H (heise.de / c’t) showcases several different work pieces that have been produced by 3D printer web stores. As these videos show, it’s in particular possible to print devices with moving parts in one single go. For those who want to try this out themselves, there are several online services that offer 3D printing services, among them 

Yes. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), Part III, people can be forced by police to surrender keys to encrypted data. This law has been applied at least three times, twice up until 2009 according to Claire Ward, Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Ministry of Justice, and one additional time in 2010 according to The Register. 

It's apparently quite a popular story to "disprove doubting Atheists" regarding the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites during the Exodus of the Hebrew bible that in the late 1970s, archaeological evidence was found at the bottom of the Red Sea of a "chariot army." I first saw it mentioned in this documentary trailer, then googled for more specific instances of the claim, and found this one, and a few others: 

TL;DR; There are studies that do show at least some correlation between lunar cycles and germination and plant life cycles. However, the correlation is rather complex, and apparently species-dependent. A quick google search for this finds many references to university studies on the topic, allegedly done by Wichita State University and Tulane University. The oft-quoted paragraph reads: 

The Pesticide Action Network of the UK has a well-referenced, and seemingly un-biased fact sheet on the topic of glyphosate. It discusses varoius types of toxicity, and on the topic of mamalian toxicity, it says in summary 

These assumptions ought to lead to artificially high workforce figures for my following estimate, but should provide us with a useful upper-bound to weigh Mr. Limbaugh's claim against. 1992 had a natural population growth of 1,889,401, so this many new workers will be entering the workforce this year, given our assumptions. In 2010, 1,042,626 legal immigrants came to the U.S. (We'll use the same number for 2012, since it's the latest data available). This gives us 2,932,026 new workers in 2012. So to maintian our current employment rate, we'd need to create, on average, 244,336 jobs every month. I'd say Mr. Limbaugh was off by at least a factor of 2-3. Unless, of course, he's pining for the rights of illegal immigrants who don't get counted in these numbers, and who cannot file for unemployment benefits. :) 

All of which are different effects of mental illness. The list comes from the 1996 review by Kelly, I. W., James Rotton, and Roger Culver, The Moon was Full and Nothing Happened: A Review of Studies on the Moon and Human Behavior and Human Belief 

The American Heart Journal has published a three-year study of the therapeutic effects of intercessory prayer of 1800 patients undergoing heart bypass surgery. The study divided subjects into three groups: those receiving no intercessory prayer, those that did, but didn’t know about it, and those that did and did know about it. Its conclusion is very clear indeed: 

No, searing doesn’t seal in the juices. Probably the only rigorous analysis of this has been done by Kenji López-Alt for Serious Eats. 

Bear in mind that the rest of the body is usually clothed which provides the most important insulation of the body, as can be seen in a thermal scan image: thermal imaging system screening passengers for H1N1 flu $URL$ [Scale is heat loss from least (bottom, blue) to most (top, red/white); source: Britannica.com] However, this image also shows that hair is actually a pretty good insulator as well. So while a clothed human indeed loses much of their heat through the head, donning a hat won’t help. There is another aspect: the body will strive to keep the core body temperature constant. If necessary, it does this by down-regulating blood circulation (and consequently heat exchange) in the periphery (arms, legs); in contrast, the blood circulation through the head (in particular, the brain) stays almost constant: Body core temperature $URL$ In fact, next to the trunk (clothed!) the head emits the most amount of heat per area (skin temperature of 34.6°C) [source: Blatteis, Physiology and pathophysiology of temperature regulation, p. 17], and also the most total energy of any non-clothed area [ibd.]. So yes, when clothed (and not immersed in water; this diminishes the insulating effect of clothing significantly!) we do indeed lose most of our body heat through our head. However, except for bald people, hats may not help that much (to maintain the core body temperature).
