So to keep people from being stressed, we should give them control. If we didn't have P2, we wouldn't be able to conclude that the people with control and no heart disease did not still have high stress. (They might have high stress and no heart disease because they're physically fit, for instance.) Then we wouldn't be able to say that having control meant not having stress. This is equivalent to not being able to assert that having stress meant not having control. 

Unfortunately I don't yet have an inference rule for -introduction, assuming one exists, which is not a given. If it doesn't, though, then there is no way to leave as primitive, because I cannot prove using only . I will update this answer if I find anything new, and accept it if I do. 

The only even number that is prime is the number two, and all other prime numbers are odd. It is true because an evil demon, as Descartes proposed, could not make me go wrong in believing this incorrect. It's, dare I say, categorically true. 

The ancient Greeks called pure and robust peace of mind Ataraxia. It is when one discovers no belief can ever be justified, at least according to the Pyrrhonists. As such, one suspends judgement upon anything non-evident. The condition was said to have fallen upon the master painter Apelles; while trying to paint the foam of a horse, likely frothy saliva near its mouth. He was so unsuccessful, in despair, he threw the sponge he was using to clean his brushes with at the medium and created the effect of the horse's foam. Both the Stoics and the Epicureans also made use of the term. 

Unjust prayers You correctly note that God , even when such a prayer entails injustice. This is however not a problem with prayer but rather our flawed application of it. Of course God will not grant a prayer for an unjust action; such a wish is, I think, probably to be counted as a sin. Prayer generally But of course these are not the only kinds of prayers. The more interesting question is, why pray at all? After all, God has perfect knowledge, and God's will is immutable, so if you are in the kind of trouble that God would help you with, God is already knows about it and is already either going to help you or not. From Aquinas's Summa Theologica, Part 2.2, Question 83, On Prayer, Article 2, Whether it is becoming to pray?: 

According to the Sorites, all men have beards, they just vary in length, density and coarseness. In a loose sense, a beard must have some appreciable length to be considered a beard. Yet, how much is 'appreciable'? Based on the vagueness of the predicate 'has a beard', I'm not lying when I say such and such, has a beard despite being clean shaven, because what I'm saying is true. Even those people who use the loose sense of the meaning 'beard' would come up with different explanations of what they think a beard is amongst themselves. So, why would someone argue that I lied, if suppose I saw a man rob a store and I tell the police he had a beard despite being clean shaven? 

In Three Dialogues, Berkeley advances a theory of subjective idealism. Things only exist as experiences of individual consciousnesses. These things are static and themselves unthinking, as they are pure ideas. And they persist even when we are not looking at them because God is looking at them all the time. Here's the thing, though---if esse est percipi, how do we exist? We aren't always perceiving ourselves. We sleep, for instance. And our actual selves are not just pure ideas. We are active and thinking. So we can't exist in God's mind in the same way that, for instance, a tree does. If only unthinking substances can be perceived, and only that which is perceived can exist, how does anything exist to do the perceiving? 

Newcomb's problem might help us understand our difficulties between freewill and determinism. There are two boxes; one box is opaque and the other is translucent. In the translucent box is one thousand pounds. The opaque box contains either a million pounds or nothing. There is an omniscient being capable of accurately predicting our choice before we execute it. If the being predicts we shall take only the contents of the opaque box, there shall be one million pounds in it for us to share. However, if we select the contents of both boxes, there will be nothing in the opaque box. According to the principle of maximizing expected utility, we should select only the contents of the opaque box and leave the other one alone. However, according to the principle of dominance, we should select the contents of both boxes because our action occurs after the contents of both boxes are already set up by the predictor. Here is the difficulty with the principle of maximizing expected utility: Suppose we decide to take the contents of only the opaque box. As we walk away with our loot, we look back at the transparent box and realize there is a thousand pounds in it. What is stopping us from going back and taking it? After all, we already received the million pounds and the thousand pounds in the translucent box just cannot disappear into thin air and we would also prove the predictor is unreliable. Suppose, we open the contents of just the opaque box and find nothing, then we can just leave the other box alone, it's just a paltry thousand pounds, to prove the predictor is unreliable. So, an omniscient being capable of accurately predicting our actions, in a deterministic universe, can easily be shown as being unreliable by doing as outlined above. I believe we have freewill (determinism doesn't pass muster), as we are able to outwit an omniscient being. 

It's obvious that relative wonder is compatible with a scientific perspective. My first instinct was to say that Dawkins only feels relative wonder, while Keats feels absolute wonder. But I don't think that has to be true. There's a way in which the scientist's rainbow is no longer absolutely wonderful. One of the great things about rainbows is that they don't require any analysis; just look at them and you'll feel joy. The experience is sort of unmediated. But then look at the rainbow through the eyes of a physicist. The rainbow is no longer mysterious and no longer experienced unmediated. That's not to say a physicist can't enjoy rainbows; they can, but not in the same way as usual while they are investigating its electromagnetic properties. But I think Keats goes too far if he says that science must destroy miracles. Instead it can defer them. The miraculous thing is no longer: Look, a rainbow!, but: Look, the amazing intricacies of refraction and wave motion! This may well be the wonder Dawkins is describing. I know some mathematicians who feel the same way. To your last thought: On what principled grounds can we say rainbows are wonderful but the US tax code is not? I'm not sure that any exist, but do we need them? It doesn't seem to me that there's an exact science of wonder. Nor should there be. Part of the wonder of wonders is their fuzziness, the way they appeal to me, not some lifeless objective standard. 

Conversing with friends, and even perceived enemies, are company. Very few people can stand being alone for long (even Sartre didn't like being alone). Good friends and loved ones, worthy of trust, can be comforting when nasty things happen (e.g. violence, war, massacre, crime, illness, insanity, hatred and so on). 

Helen Keller lost her senses of both sight and hearing at a very young age. She was described as being an "animal". While her teacher, Annie Sullivan, held her hands under a water pump, the young girl realized the sign language impressed into her palm by her teacher were words. Certainly her experience of consciousness depended, at least in part, upon her available sense impressions. A being, like a bat, experiences consciousness differently than we do because they "see" with their ears. But to answer your question, if I lost all my senses, I would be in a vegetative state, in much the same way a person put under a general anaesthetic experiences nothing. In my opinion, consciousness does depend on the sense impressions and the mind is nothing without them. 

You should ask yourself two kinds of questions: First, are humans in fact naturally immoral? Why would those statements be true? Does the lived experience of men tell you anything about how they necessarily view people of other genders? Where would such behavior even come about, and is it not more plausible that it is inculcated in us by society? (Consider the motives of those who say such things. If somebody is telling you that "it is men's nature to be misogynists" my guess is they aren't doing it out of a spirit of honest intellectual inquiry.) And second, are humans in fact naturally anything? The idea that humans have free will is not a new one. If that's the case, then while there are biological requirements of humanity, there are no behavioral requirements. The idea that we "have" to act in some way is false, so there is no conflict between our "natural" obligations and our moral obligations. 

In North America, we celebrate a glorious holiday called Groundhog Day. On the second of February, the marmots awaken and leave their burrows, along with their families, to examine the weather. If the animals see their shadows, they'll retreat back in, and it means six more weeks of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, if they don't see their shadows, spring is well on its way. Hurray! For example, examine this poem from Scotland. If Candle-mas Day is bright and clear, There'll be two winters in the year. If Candle-mas be fair and bright, Winter has another flight. If Candle-mas brings clouds and rain, Winter will not come again. Now, skepticism says groundhogs are unable to predict future weather events. But are they so sure? Isn't it possible that groundhogs can sense things about weather that we are unable to? I understand marmots are dull sighted, but have an incredibly good sense of smell. It makes sense then, these rodents, are able to detect things about weather us humans are unable to?
