But nothing has been resolved. You waited longer than expected for a raise less than you expected. I would feel better if it was the lowest raise of the group - at least then there is an up side. 

This is wrong and a poor example for others but it is just plain above your pay grade. Clearly other people have noticed this including your boss. You could ask your boss what you should do but I bet he/she will say let it go. If you have security training then you should have procedure for reporting a security breach. Not sure I would do it but it is an option for you. 

It is certainly about as strong as it can get without being for sure. That date is probably not under his control. You qualify for the position in his mind. Someone more qualified might come up. If you get another offer before that date you can most likely stall until that date. I think you should keep on interviewing even if you hate it. If you cannot stall definitely tell the director you have another offer. 

Take this as an opportunity to show initiative and interest, instead of being afraid of upsetting your boss. Explain to him that you'd like to work on F (in your free time, if that's acceptable in the culture of your employer - otherwise, during a small percentage of the normal work day). Make it clear that you already understand and follow the priority he has set, but that you think you can add value by solving F without impacting his priorities and F is a subject that you're already knowledgeable about. It's fine to mention that you're personally interested, but I would also make sure there's a clear value-add for the employer, in order to give him incentive beyond just letting you work on a pet project of yours. 

Which brings us to the most significant point in your question: Are you actually upset about your own (minor?) underpaid status, or are you upset about your perception of your brother-in-law's overpaid status? If you're upset about your own status, do something about it. If you're upset about his status, get over it. 

In summary, you want to present yourself as a skilled software engineer interested in domain X instead of as someone who's been writing code for routers. 

I think you are asking the wrong question. There is no normal. At your current company it is what it is. If you think you cannot meet your deadline you need to tell your boss now. If you think guidance will fix that then tell them. If you need to offload and get guidance then tell them. 

In salary it is more about what you produce. But skills help you produce. The most skilled person may be one of the worst producer. Some skills are very limited and do have a market range but you are not at that level. Focus on the value. I took it own my own to produce these report that do X and save the company Y. In an interview they are more stuck measuring skills. 

You are an employee and it is a request from your boss. You can block web sites. Just installing Diablo should be a violation. I would ask for the request in writing with a cc to HR. If you can have it set up that your boss views the screen shots but not you. You can even record the whole day but then someone has to watch the whole day. Privacy laws in the US are different and I am not a lawyer so I have no idea about the legality. Based on excellent comments from WernerCD and slebetman another option is to monitor IP addresses and ports. Without seeing the actual content you can show when sites or game servers were accessed. This may be a difference in privacy but that is a legal question 

I think you need to consider long and hard why you don't like sharing personal projects. If there's a legitimate reason, then consider making some "marketing use" projects: develop something specifically for the purpose of showing off your skills, and put that in your portfolio. There's no rule that you have to share your (sensitive) personal projects, and tailor-making something for the purpose of marketing yourself will allow you to really show off your skills, versus just sharing whatever you happened to be doing anyways. 

Not only is it likely acceptable, it will likely be taken as a good sign. In my experience, employers are often very willing to coach/guide staff who are interested in applying internally to new positions. I've often been in the position of the hiring manager who had an internal candidate reach out and ask questions before applying for a job, or before an interview. It gives both parties a way to help set the stage for a productive interview. That said, it may make sense to run this by your manager first. You could say something like, 

Approach this by first trying to understand the employer's perspective. Do you think they REALLY want a candidate who can solve a specific programming challenge? Skills tests do allow an evaluation of a specific skill, but they also allow a company to see how someone behaves under pressure. That can mean they're also looking at your communication, attitude, ability to work with others, and other soft skills. It's common in an interview to ask a question without caring about the actual, literal answer - you're more interested in seeing the overall reaction. The employer (probably) understands that while coding php without framework may be of dubious value, it allows a candidate to show that they can understand and execute specific instructions. Skills can be learned. Attitude, communication, and reaction to instructions are harder to teach. Employers like people who are already good at those things, and are willing to learn and develop their skills, versus people who are only interested in proving they're right and they already know everything. If you do decide to follow up, consider that in your response, and consider it the next time you're given a skills test in an interview. To address your specific question: 

Deputed would not be used like that in the US. The good news is that in a downsizing if you are bringing in revenue you will be last to go. Your employer can still deny your raise. Point out that you have good customer satisfaction and have stayed billable. If that is not a good reason for a raise I don't know what is. 

Most are good. CS and data science is hot right now. You don't want a bad recruiter spamming your resume. Talk to them and start with specific interview(s). Don't give them permission to spam your resume. Ask them some questions and be sure they at least know what data science it. Scour the job boards and also apply direct. Companies don't have to pay the recruiter fee if they hire you direct. 

If he wants to speak to your team lead then that is his choice. If he tells you to tell your team lead ... then you are really in a tough spot. 

A lot depends on how convenient it is for you to interview. If it is a local interview and you can spare a day then address salary when you get an offer. Don't use your cost of living as a basis to support your number. At the end of the interview you pretty much should have demonstrated your value to them. "I am sorry but I would need to decline that number - my minimum salary is X". They may have some really rigid guidelines on salary and cannot do much. Another option would be to ask them a range up front. The problem you have there is if it is not in your range then you can't really take an interview and then ask for a salary above that range. 

Internships aren't supposed to be exams. They're supposed to be learning opportunities. And not just opportunities to learn specific technical skills, but opportunities to learn how to behave in a professional setting. A big part of professional behavior is being able to receive constructive feedback, and being able to act on it, in order to improve yourself. Being rated a 2 is a great opportunity to learn these lessons and put some effort into showing your boss and your coordinator that you're able to grow. If you improve and get your passing grade, congrats. If not, don't think of this as a failure, think of it as a learning opportunity. Incorporate what you've learned into your next internship (selecting where to intern, how to behave in the interview, how to make sure expectations are understood upfront, how to improve on areas where you aren't meeting expectations). Failing at this internship doesn't mean all hope is lost. Speaking as a hiring manager, I'd rather hire someone who had a failed internship and a second one where they demonstrated that they solved the problems from the first, versus someone who just aced their way through an internship and maybe didn't gain anything from it except some lines on their resume. 

O U C H ! If you know how the contract is worded it probably only points to you or a couple people. What you are asserting is not very believable. If the President is hiring the friend just to pay them then the friend would be keeping a low profile. If this pseudo VP has gotten to the point of outsourced projects overseas the party is over or the investors are in on the party. Time to lay low and put out your resume. 

No they are not necessarily required to pay accrued vacation time. It has happened to me in two states and I took it up with the state labor board. If there is no stated cash equivalent then there is no cash equivalent. You cannot assume the cash value of a vacation day is your prorated pay. The safe bet is to explicitly use the vacation time. On holiday they typically will not give you credit for the holiday if you don't work after the holiday. The safe bet is to work one day after the holiday. 

Management is not going to deny a formal complaint. That would be terrible for moral. Have you seen the complaint? If so respond in writing. Get a meeting with management and discuss how to fix it. Don't make it about saving your ass and they are brats. You might cover how this situation escalated. Be open that you should have better documented performance problems and will do so in the future. What goes against you here is you seem to have problems with the whole team so it can look like you are the problem. I hope the senior manager that did not want you there is still not there. Don't get defensive but this could go poorly. If management does not openly support you (even if you get a private reprimand) then you are not going to ever get control of this group. 

Usually, after a few times through the cycle, a pattern will emerge, at which point you can ask for confirmation of the pattern. If no pattern emerges, make it a point to raise the question in the broader context - ask him for a meeting to discuss review standards, or however would be appropriate in your context. Basically - in summary - don't wait until he's telling you that you're wrong. Ask upfront. And if that doesn't work, and he still tells you you're wrong, take advantage (right there on the spot) and ask for clarification on the future. 

The best way for us to answer your question will depend on those factors: If there's an agreement that states you get a specific vehicle, defined a certain way, after 2 years, then this becomes easy: you can point that out and negotiate appropriately. Ask for a raise based on the discrepancy, or ask for a better vehicle. But based on the fact that you're asking here, I'm assuming that's not the case. So: the real problem appears to be, there's a component of your compensation for which you have no specific definition. You think you were supposed to get a specific vehicle, the employer is giving you one based on what they think you're supposed to get. You're defining value as the MSRP, the employer is defining it based on the lease cost. It's very common for vehicles with vastly different MSRPs to lease for the same monthly payment based on other factors (residual value, differences in interest rates, mileage included, brand or dealer promotions only good for a certain timeframe, etc). So it's no surprise that your definition of value is different than the employer's. You've already pointed this discrepancy out to the employer, and they explained it - the lease cost determines the car you get. I don't think you pointing it out was unreasonable, but you've already had an answer. At this point, since there is apparently no formal definition of the value of the vehicle as part of your compensation, and the employer has explained how they determine the value, there's not much on which to base your argument for additional compensation. "would it be a good idea" or "what do you think I should do" questions don't really fit the Stack Exchange model well, but in this case, it seems pretty clear that it would not be a good idea to push the issue further, unless you have some grounds on which to do that which you haven't mentioned here.
