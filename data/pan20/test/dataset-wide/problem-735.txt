Typically it's the brake pads that wear faster as they are the softer material. However, under certain (but rather special) conditions it can be the other way round. If you ride in an area where there's lots of dust from hard and sharp materials in the air (something like granite dust or dust from volcanic rock) and it is in addition often rainy, you might get some grinding paste like debris onto your brake pads that could grind down your rims in no time. But luckily that is a rather rare occasion and normally rims should last for several sets of brake pads. Also both have normally indicators that tell you when they need replacement. For the brake pads you should replace them by the latest when they are worn down so much that the notches – that are to better remove water and debris from their surface – are no longer existent. Rims have for some years now also a notch (often differently colored) in their braking surface. If the surface is worn down so much that the notch is gone, they should be also be replaced. In this case it's also a safety thing as the structural integrity of the rim might get affected if you use it above that point. 

I assume we're not talking about some low-price, no-name thing from a Walmart sale but about one from one of the more common speedometer selling companies (cyclosport, sigma, garmin, to name a few). With those, I don't think that there will be significant differences in accuracy. Also wired vs. wireless should not make a difference by itself (unless the batteries of the transmitter get weak on a wireless one, of course). In former times (15 years ago or so), I had some issues with a wireless speedometer when crossing or riding right beside electrified railway tracks, where the transmission seemingly was confused by noise from the railroad's power line. Nowadays I would guess that wireless speedometers use digitally encoded signals so this issue should be gone. 

I have never ridden in a peloton but I would say they should be not more unsafe than the chain blades that are already on your bike. While riding, the only parts of your neighbour's bike that you would be able to hit should be the handle bar and maybe their pedals. Everything else is far less outstanding than those two parts and you should collide with your neighbours body before coming even close to say their disc brakes. So the only real chance to hit someone else's brake rotors might be in case of a crash where you fall on their bike or their bike falls on you. In this case, there are a lot of parts on a bike that could give some bad injuries, for example the chain blades. And you will also hit the ground, so chances are high that you get injured by the fall as well. Adding disc brake rotors (which even are somewhat "shielded" by the wheel itself) might not add significant injury risk in this case. So I would consider them safe in these terms. Another point that might be worth a thought is their performance. Image the guy in front of a group is the only one to have disc brakes and does an emergency stop. With their bigger brake performance they might decelerate much faster than the ones with the conventional brakes behind them, causing all others to hit him from behind. 

From your description I would guess that your problem not about learning how to do it (you can do it, but only on one side) but more about fear and confidence. There are two things you will need: 

Normally the manufacturer of the brakes gives some minimum value for the rotor thickness. For higher prized brakes they often even provide some gauge that lets you easily check if the rotor is still thick enough. Typically the minimum thickness might be somewhere below 2mm (I believe to remember that the absolute minimum for Magura discs should be 1.7 or 1.8 mm). But as said, this should be an information that should be in the manual fo your brakes. 

I don't think this is problematic. Those gels consist mainly of sugar which is a good preserving agent and are sealed air-tight which means they shoudn't get easily contaminated. So if none of the following conditions are fulfilled, I wouldn't mind using such a gel that is some months over their "best before" date: 

Conclusion: Just from the additional potential energy point of view it may not make much of a difference but if you concern bike handling or fatigue close to your limits, it will have a larger effect. 

Without digging too deep into the physics of damped motion now, I say "there isn't an optimal damping setting for all riders and terrains". Let's consider first the critical damping case as defined in the wikipedia article. This is based on the case that you "excite" your system (i.e. set it into motion) once and then leave it alone until it has calmed down again due to damping. The best approximation in real life cycling would an isolated pothole or curb on an otherwise smooth road: once you've hit that obstacle, your suspension compresses and then returns back to its initial state, if there is no second bump during the time it takes the suspension to relax again. As the suspension is only uncompressing here, it's also only rebound damping that matters. So what happens now as we go to a rougher surface where the time between bumps is shorter than the time constant of the damping, i.e. the time it takes the suspension to return into its initial state? Lets say the first bump you hit fully compresses the fork and as it has relaxed halfway back you hit another bump of the same strength which will set your fork again to full compression (if it could it would maybe even compress further). On the second bump your fork will only give you half of its travel as it is still halfway compressed from the first one. now consider an even rougher surface where the suspension can only uncompress 10% of its travel between bumps and you (hopefully) can easily see that sooner or later you will ride with your suspension nearly fully compressed, leaving you with no suspension at all. To overcome this, you can reduce rebound damping which enables your suspension to uncompress faster at the cost of overshooting. Therefore your suspension gets more wobbly but it can react better to frequent bumps. Compression damping comes into play when the suspension compresses (surprise?). A stronger compression damping reduces the speed the suspension compresses which is also the reason why most higher priced forks and shocks realize their lockout mechanism through high compression damping – this way you still have some suspension left for the really hard bumps. A stronger compression damping on your rough surface also means that your suspension is using less travel for the same sizes bumps, however, this time it is not converging towards the maximum compression level but tends to stay at sag level, i.e. the compression it has under rider weight. As a consequence, you can "save" a bit of travel for the really hard bumps if you raise your compression damping at the cost of a harder riding experience and a slower reaction of your suspension. 

All not-lowest-end suspension forks (at least the ones I know of) have a rake that is created by shifting the axle in front of the lower tubes. Let's take a wheel of radius r (solid blue circle) and add some clearance for the tire (dashed blue circle). Above that, the upper edge of the lower tubes shall be of equal height with respect to the upper tube's axis. Here we can already see, that the wheel passes the front side of the lowers at a "higher" position than its back side. As the arches (green rectangles) have to span from one lower tube to the other over the clearance radius, we can see that the arch in the front side (the right one in the image) has to reach higher (higher green rectangle) above the lower tube's body than the one on the back side. Technically speaking this means, that to build an arch with the same stiffness, less material (i.e. less weight) is needed on a reversed arch or at the same weight, the reversed arch can be built more massive and therefore stiffer. Unfortunately I don't have any measurement values about how much influence that really has. And obviously there are (or at least were, cf. heltonbike's answer) other drawbacks to be taken into account. 

If you are reasonably firm at riding one-handed, you can drive them home by riding one of them while pushing/pulling the other one beside you with one hand. Let's assume that the bike you will ride is called A and the one you push/pull is B. First decide, which bike is better to be ridden and therefore will be your bike A and which hand is better to get freed to steer bike B. Which hand is better will depend on if you will need to change gears and how your brakes are arranged on the handle bars. Then lean bike B somewhere, e.g. to a tree or wall – putting it on its stand is not so good as it might get complicated to get the stand folded in later. Also make sure to lean it on with the correct side, depending on your choice of which hand you want to use to steer it. Finally mount bike A and place yourself on the bike beside B. Now grab either the stem or the center of the handlebar (where it is held by the stem) of bike B, such that you have some steering control over the handlebar if you twist your wrist. The most complicated part in this is starting as you will have some wobbly moments on the start and you have to take care not to interfere with the handlebars of both bikes. Having drop bars (as in your case) will make things a bit easier in terms of interference as they are not that wide and it is easier to keep both bikes separated. Also you have to take care to not lean onto the wrong bike, as putting your weight on bike B will make it go somewhere more or less unpredictable and you're quite likely to crash. So only put your weight onto bike A's handle bar. Once you have the whole train running, this arrangement is quite fine (albeit a bit clumsy) as long as you don't have to cope with too much traffic (which is given in your case). However, 5 miles is some piece to ride this way so expect to be somewhat slower than normal and plan to do some pauses on your way as you won't have a very relaxed riding position. 

There are lots of comparisons in the web, however they tend to get outdated or vanish from time to time, so I won't recommend or link any particular one here. Instead use your favourite search engine with terms like "bicycle/road bike/mountain bike groupset comparison" or the like. But you can also do a quick check yourself: Choose a component that is usually part of all groups (a derailleur for example), search your favourite online bike shop for it and note the price for the parts from different groups. This should scale fairly well to the whole component group and give you a rough estimate on how they are positioned towards each other. 

When you remove all the thorns very carefully you could keep using the tire. Unfortunately this might be some hassle with 30+ thorns and you can not be a 100% sure that you really have removed all of them. Also some may have broken off in a way that you see the remains from neither inside nor outside but the remains may be pushed further inside after some time of usage causing a new flat. Therefore my advice would be: If you can afford it you're better off with a new tire. If you want to save the money, try to very carefully remove all the thorns you see or feel. Especially on the inside you should check the tire with your fingers if there's something sticking through. Even then you will have to look out for a higher puncture probability that means you should be prepared to deal with it, i.e. carry an extra spare tube and a repair kit if you don't do this already. 

It may depend on the overall age of the bike but I would guess that in most cases it's better to sell it as a whole. If the bike only consists of rather standard components that one could easily buy at a LBS, then they wouldn't make high prices and the additional work to break it all down and maybe set them all on on ebay separately may not be worth the money. I can imagine only two cases where it may be better to sell it in parts or at least to sell some parts separately:
