What you have described is a limit screw or cable tension adjustment issue. If the chain is being guided so that the plates are landing on the cog teeth instead of the rollers then you need to adjust one or the other or both. The replaced sprocket may have caused it to start happening. On the other hand, is it possible that you bent your derailleur hanger? This will knock the aforementioned adjustments out of whack. 

Stay seated! Move your butt way forward so that you're basically sitting on the nose of the saddle. It's not at all comfortable but it moves your center of gravity forward which does two things- it helps keep your front wheel on the ground and helps your rear wheel keep traction. Don't slam your saddle forward because you're having trouble climbing. You don't want to compromise your normal riding position so that you're always ready to climb- the rest of your riding will suffer. Of the reasons for adjusting saddle position for XC riding, center of gravity is not one of them. Shift down a gear or two so that your cadence is higher than normal, but without being awkwardly high. Try to spin relatively smoothly up the hill. Once again, this aids in keeping traction with the rear wheel. Too high a gear and you'll stall, too low a gear and you'll find yourself losing your line. Drop your forearms to be parallel with the ground and pull back and down through your power stroke. This keeps your center of gravity lower and further forward while helping the rear wheel hold traction at the point when it's most likely to spin out. Don't be too forceful with this motion or else you'll just knock yourself off course on your ascent. This was probably the most useful piece of advice I was ever given to improve my climbing. 

No. The advice on weighting of the pedals and the bars stays the same. Drop the outside pedal and weight it primarily, weight the inside handlebar. Note that the primary reason that you're weighting the inside bar is to initiate countersteer. 

If I remember correctly Shimano recommends lacing with trailing spoke heads in (flat part out) for rear drive-side whereas Sheldon Brown recommends the opposite, so take the reasoning that sounds best to you and run with it. Ultimately it probably doesn't matter much, especially if your chain doesn't fall off to the inside which it shouldn't if everything is in proper adjustment. I just looked at two sets of wheels that I have built which are nearly identical. On the older set I have drive-side trailing spokes with heads facing out, on the other set they are facing in. I have no recollection of why I made the change. I do not notice a difference and I haven't had problems out of either set. If I were going to build another set right now I would probably do trailing heads facing out, but as Sheldon Brown pointed out: 

Won't work. Dyna-Sys uses a different pull ratio than Shimano road components, and the cassette uses a slightly different spacing as well. You could use a SRAM cassette, but that still leaves you with the derailleur issue. They do make 105 and Ultegra long cage derailleurs, however. If you've got a double up front, especially a double with proper cyclocross gearing (tigher ratio than standard or compact road), the long cage road derailleur should be more than adequate. 

Most aluminum frames have a replaceable derailleur hanger, which typically is part of the dropout itself as you can kind of see in this image: 

With the exception of the new electronic stuff, every shifter out there that isn't the old friction style works on a ratchet and spring mechanism to index the amount of cable being pulled or released. Is that what you are asking? 

I can't say for sure if the chainrings work on that crank in your particular configuration. It sounds like they should. Keep in mind that road triples are inherently troublesome (though some might disagree with me) and require a little more mucking with to get adjusted. If your front shifter doesn't have trim/half shifts between full shifts, you may need to let out the cable on your front derailleur a little and actually let the chain drag slightly against the cage when in those extreme gears on the cassette. This will keep the chain off of the shifting pins of the big chain ring. Not real awesome but it might be the best you can get away with on your current setup. It also sounds like your chainline is not optimal. Are there any spacers between the bottom bracket shell and the outboard bearing cups? If so, you may need to move one to the drive side. If not, don't add them. Worst case you may need to go back to Truvativ rings. Hard to say for sure as it's always difficult to diagnose bikes over the internet. 

Ask yourself this- would you buy a car off of Alibaba to save a few bucks, or would you fork over a little more money and buy a Honda/Toyota/whatever? Buy the name brand bike. If your Alibaba bike's headtube snaps off on a gnarly high speed descent, who's going to do something about it? Not Alibaba, and good luck getting the manufacturer from god knows where to do anything about the catastrophic failure of their no-name bike. Buying the bike pictured is a total gamble, not just in terms of your money, but in terms of your safety as well. Play it safe, pay a little more, and stick with the Giant- they've got a great reputation, they make great bikes, and they back them up. Alibaba is for widgets. A bike is not a widget. 

Something is wrong with the casing. Not safe to ride. Sometimes the come from the factory that way, who knows why. Send it back and get it exchanged. Don't risk a catastrophic blowout. 

Strategy, Strategy, Strategy! Road racing is an anaerobic chess game. It is rarely the strongest person who wins in a road race, but the smartest. Largely, this can only come with experience. That's something I don't have a ton of when it comes to road racing, but I can give you a couple of pointers if you're just getting into it: The biggest tip I can give you is to spend as little time on the front as you can. Don't let the pack use you. I've seen this plenty of times before, especially with inexperienced but strong riders. The group will gladly let you hang yourself out to ride, so don't offer yourself up. Ever heard the term "sit in to win?" Next, don't go with every breakaway. It seems exciting, but chances are all its going to do is rag you out. You need to choose your battles, and 99% of Cat5 breakaways aren't going to be worth taking part in as they're just going to get chased down. Finally, get out of Cat5 as quick as you can. There's a reason it's called "Crash5." 

On a road bike, typically only for slow speed maneuvers. There are probably exceptions but I can't think of them at the moment. 

I'll try to make the best out of this question by giving what is hopefully a helpful answer to others. You would be really surprised just how clean you can get synthetic or cork bar tape, even if it's white, with a little bit of orange degreaser. Get a clean, preferably white rag, pour some on, and take one end of the towel in each hand and scrub the tape as if you were shining a shoe. Without much effort you can get it looking nearly brand new again. 

When wearing a balaclava I've found that I really have to concentrate on breathing through the fabric as opposed to letting my breath travel up and out around the eye opening, especially when stopped. If you're still having significant issues with fogging without the balaclava it may be that the glasses actually fit too snugly to your face and perspiration is not venting adequately. Many frames with interchangeable lenses have optional vented lenses which may help, or you might try a different pair if glasses that sit a little further off of your face. I also find that when stopped it helps to pull my glasses down on my nose to let them breathe. There are also a handful of purpose made anti fog applications for glasses which you could try. Finally, if you're willing to try some rather strange sounding stuff, this eHow article lists several solutions that use household cleaners. 

You may need to toe them in more that what this picture is showing if they continue to squeal on you. 

First of all, to reinforce what Daniel pointed out, do NOT approach such an obstacle at an angle unless you want to eat pavement. Hit step ups, step downs, and especially railroad tracks as perpendicularly as possible. If it's a right turn you're taking, assuming you're in a country that drives on the right side of the street, signal, take the lane, and take a wide turn so you're hitting the lip at a 90 degree angle or close to it. Left turn you should offer you a little more room. That's the first half of hitting such an obstacle safely without dismounting from the bike. 

Given the fact that the outer plates are deformed in the same direction, I believe you're probably cranking on the pedals way too hard when you're shifting. Are you waiting too long to downshift in the front when starting up an incline? Are you standing while shifting? Are your forcing the front derailleur by putting excessive pressure on the shift lever? Any one of these factors are going to increase your chances of busting a chain. The bigger person you are weight wise, the more you have to be careful of these things, although you can weigh under a buck and still trash chains if you don't give them some love. Keep in mind that when shifting you're putting side load on the chain links and really torquing them in a way they don't appreciate. You need to let off a little when you make any shift, up or down, front or rear. Beyond saving your chain from breakage, it will also save your drivetrain from premature and excessive wear. 

My understanding is that UCI and USAC use the same minimum weight limit for bikes, but for USAC this only applies in certain circumstances. Taken from this document from USAC: 

Is there a chance the rim is wearing out? Have you tried a different wheel? Have you tried toeing the brakes in the opposite direction? It sounds like you've tried just about everything else. I'm leaning towards the wheel being the issue. Otherwise it sounds like the frame is just prone to resonance with the vibration of the brakes. I've got a mtb frame that doest this horribly with the back brake. Several friends have the same frame with different brakes but the same issue. Some frames are just more likely to resonate than others, though it's usually more of a wheel issue with rim brakes. 

Highly dependent on the manufacturing process, of which there are a handful of categories and endless variations. Most carbon frames these days are some variation of the monocoque process, and if I were to venture to guess I would say your 02 Calfee is carbon lugged carbon tubes- so there's one difference. Given the brand that you currently own I assume you'll be looking for a high end replacement for it. You're almost certainly going to find yourself looking at lighter frames, but over the last few years many manufacturers have started focusing on improving ride quality over weight savings of their top of the line frames. You'll hear the terms "lateral stiffness" and "vertical compliance" a lot, as those are 2 of the primary qualities (but not the only qualities) that make for a good riding, good handling bike. These are the areas where you should see the most improvement over your current frame. On the other hand, if you're happy with your current frame beyond the paint, maybe you should consider getting it repainted which Calfee themselves would help you out with, or at least get you pointed in the right direction. if you'd like a more in depth description of lateral, vertical, and torsional stiffness and compliance, and how bike manufacturers try to balance them all out read this article. 

It depends on the brand. Most brands used to use a heavy packing grease that was very tacky and an absolute dirt magnet. It's more of a preservative for the metal than a lubricant. Some manufacturers have moved away from that type of grease to a lighter lube that you can use out of the package (Shimano moved to this lighter lubricant if I remember correctly, SRAM has not). Regardless of brand, if the new chain feels overly tacky you can use your favorite lube and over-apply it to the chain then give it a thorough wipe down to remove the excess. Your lighter lubricant will combine with the heavier lubricant and help remove it. You can also use a non-water based solvent on a rag to achieve the same result, just be sure you re-lube the chain afterwards. 

That is purely marketing. It's a common ploy with components, but I've never seen it on an entire frame until now. Aluminum and carbon can be used in conjunction effectively, but not in this case. The carbon wrap on that bike is basically veneer. While Schwinn was once upon a time a well respected brand, they suffered a major fall from grace after going bankrupt. Their bikes, even their bike shop level bikes (i think they call them their "select" series bikes) target the budget market. They're not horrible, but they're not great either. The bike you posted a link to is no exception. One could argue that the combination of dissimilar materials would aid to vibration dampening, but that's really just more marketing jargon, at least in this case. That bike will still ride just like a full aluminum framed bike would. If you are considering that bike save yourself a few bucks and just go with a full aluminum frame. 

As long as your choosing a 9 speed Shimano shifter for the rear and triple shifter for the front you'll be fine. That's basically everything in the Deore lineup, as long as it's 9 speed. Obviously you'll want to stay away from 10 speed shifters and dont try to mix and match Shimano derailleurs and SRAM shifters or vice versa. Though you didn't ask this, what may be a more important concern is how your bike is going to fit when you slap flat bars on it. Road bike frames are shorter in the effective top tube than mountain bikes are due to the fact that a straight handlebar decreases reach compared to a drop bar. Your bike is going to fit pretty darned short if you do a flat bar conversion which can cause comfort problems of it's own. There are other fit issues to be considered when doing a flat bar conversion on a road bike, but in my opinion this is the big one. 

Do these brakes have a small adjuster screw just behind the lever blade? If so, that is a reach adjustment. It allows you to adjust the distance of the lever blade from the bar. Sounds like it's turning on it's own. Some brakes have this issue. What you need is the tiniest amount of blue (workable) loctite/threadlocker on the threads of that reach adjuster bolt. Very important that you don't get it anywhere else or else it will gum everything up. I would apply it with a needle or safety pin to ensure precise application- squeezing it directly from the tube may prove messy. Once that sets, the lever should stay in place. 

You've met a mechanic that either wants you to buy more brake pads from his/her shop or doesn't know what he/she is doing. There's really no good reason to resurface your disc brake pads, let alone on a monthly basis. All that's doing is decreasing the life of your pads and temporarily decreasing your braking power until your pads bed back into the rotors. I think that the reason some mechanics feel the need to resurface disc brake pads is a carryover from the need to resurface rim brakes, which do need to be resurfaced in some instances.
