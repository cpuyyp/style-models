Of these 235 stars: None are O stars, 29 are B stars, about 120 are G giants, about 80 are K giants and only 2-3 are M giants 

The location of GW150914 was rather poorly constrained by the 6.9 ms time difference between the event when it was observed by the two separated LIGO detectors at Livingston and Hanford. Further details are here $URL$ and this site provides a visualisation of where the waves came from. 

No, that isn't close enough. The Roche Limit for break up of a rigid body, caused by tidal forces is given by $$d = 1.26 R_C \left(\frac{M_E}{M_C}\right)^{1/3},$$ where $M_E$ is the mass of the Earth, $M_C$ and $R_C$ are the mass and radius of the comet, and $d$ is how close the comet can come to the Earth before tidal forces disrupt it. If you have a comet with a 1.6 km radius and assume it has a density of 0.6 g/cc, then $M_C \simeq 10^{13}$ kg. Putting this into the Roche Limit formula, we get $d = 17,000$ km. So the comet would have to get within 10,000 km of the surface of the Earth before it broke up. 

The initial stars were made of hydrogen and helium. These enriched the interstellar medium (ISM) with some chemical elements right across the periodic table, when massive primordial stars ended their lives as supernovae. Subsequent generations of stars continue to enrich the ISM, if their lives are short enough. So the general gist of what you suggest is true, but the rate of enrichment is very slow. The Sun was born 4.5 billion years ago, but sun-like stars born within the last few million years also have a metallicity consistent with the Sun. Why is this? Well, star formation is quite inefficient; only about 10 percent of a collapsing gas cloud ends up in stars. Then a star only processes about 10-20 percent of its mass as nuclear fuel; and then only a fraction of this is returned to the ISM in the form of winds and supernova ejecta. To get a more enriched ISM requires bursts of massive star formation in dense environments. Such conditions occurred early in the life of the Milky Way and perhaps will again when we collide with the gas-rich Andromeda galaxy. In conclusion, star formation will continue into the future; the stars will very slowly get more metal-rich; there is nothing to prevent more metal-rich stars forming; perhaps the main consequence would be a small reduction in the maximum possible stellar mass (due to the increased gas opacity and consequent radiation pressure). 

The physical difference between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries is that the latter has a donor star that fills its Roche lobe. Usually, the compact object is more massive than the donor star. Mass transfer occurs via Roche lobe overflow. In high-mass X-ray binaries usually the donor star is more massive than the compact object and mass transfer is via a stellar wind. The reason that a disc may form (in either case actually, but almost always for a LMXB) is that there is too much specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass) in the accreted material to allow it to fall directly onto the compact object (angular momentum must be conserved). Broadly speaking, a condition for the formation of an accretion disc would be that the specific angular momentum of the accreted material exceeds the specific angular momentum of material in a Keplerian orbit at the surface of the compact object. The formation of an accretion disc would be favoured by short orbital periods or slower wind speeds. Material can then only be transferred onto the compact object as angular momentum is transferred outward by (possibly) viscous torques. This simple picture is immensely complicated by the presence of any strong magnetic fields. 

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has saturation limits at around 13th or 14th magnitude. You are looking at $\phi$ 1 Cancri, which is a 6th magnitude star. It is hardly surprising that SDSS fails to morphologically classify it correctly. No idea what your second question is about. You have given a link which has a latitude and longitude in the url. Longitude and latitude are not valid ways of expressing the coordinates of a celestial object. When I open this link, I see an image of your star and in the bottom left of the screen there is a display which gives the RA and Dec of where the cursor is. 

The definition of a polytrope is one for which the pressure and density are related by $$ P = K \rho^{(n+1)/n}$$ The pressure is thus assumed to be independent of temperature and simplifies the equations of stellar structure that certain analytic solutions and approximations are possible. It is however big assumption and is generally only accurate for stars/planets supported by degeneracy pressure, where $1.5<n<3$ depending on whether the degeneracy is non-relativistic or relativistic. The other instance is where the energy transport is by adiabatic convection, which gives an independent relationship between $P$ and $T$ and means that for a completely ionized gas that $P \propto \rho^{5/3}$ and $n=1.5$. A further polytropic approximation can also be made where the energy transport is predominantly radiative and where it is assumed that the radiation pressure is a fixed proportion of the total pressure. In these circumstances $P \propto \rho^{4/3}$ and $n \simeq 3$. I found a bit of a primer here, but most stellar astrophysics textbooks will go through this. The Eddington standard model assumes a radiative ($n=3$) polytrope. The vast majority of the Sun, by mass, is indeed radiative and the polytropic approximation works reasonably well. However the outer parts of the Sun (beyond about 70% of the radius) are convective and so a single polytropic model does not fare so well. So what you can do is have a "mixed polytropic model", where you divide the star up into polytropic shells with different polytropic indices, each forming the boundary conditions for the ones above and below. A double polytropic model for the Sun, with two zones that have $n_1=3$ in the interior and $n_2=1.5$ in the outer convection zone would be much more accurate. But modern astrophysical calculations do not rely on the analytic approximations of polytropes and the Lane Emden equation. They numerically solve the coupled differential equations of stellar structure, subject to the boundary conditions imposed by an atmosphere on the top of the star. EDIT: Unashamedly tempted by the bounty, I did a little bit more research. I came across some sort of high-level set of lecture notes by Robert French of Swinburne University. He discusses modelling the Sun with composite polytropes at some length. On p.8 he describes how the matching criteria at the boundaries between polytropic zones is actually quite tricky and you have to let the matching radius and central density float in order to get a smooth join. The conclusion he arrives at is that a combination of a $n_1=3$ and $n_2=1.5$ actually appears to do a worse job of fitting the entire Sun with a single polytrope (although with $n$ varied depending on which physical quantity you want on the y-axis - e.g. $\bar{n}=3.11$ for density vs radius). If on the other hand you allow the polytropic indices and the interface radius be free parameters in order to get a good match to the standard solar model, you get a really good fit with $n_1=3.94$ in the radiative zone, $n_2=1.58$ in the convection zone and an interface at 68% of the solar radius. (Plot reproduced below - compare these with the plots in your question!). 

Well, I wasn't going to answer but the other two answers are wrong, or at least incomplete. If you wish to make a black hole from a stellar-sized object, then there is no need to compress it to as small as the Schwarzschild radius (though that would certainly work and would certainly be the answer for smaller objects with negligible self-gravity). Instead, you just need to compress it to a size at which it cannot be possibly supported by any plausible equation of state against further gravitational collapse. It turns out that this is somewhat bigger than the Schwarzschild radius and hence the density required is considerably lower. More details below. There is a radius, larger than the Schwarzschild radius at which a neutron star, quark matter, whatever its equation of state, cannot be supported against collapse. There are limits imposed by causality and General Relativity on the structure of compact stars. In "Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars" by Shapiro & Teukolsky, pp.260-261, it is shown, approximately, that even if the equation of state hardens to the point where the speed of sound equals the speed of light, that $(GM/Rc^2)<0.405$. The Schwarzschild radius is $R_s=2GM/c^2$ and therefore $R > 1.23 R_s$ for stability. This limit is reached for a neutron star with $M \simeq 3.5 M_{\odot}$. A more accurate treatment in Lattimer (2013) suggests that a maximally compact neutron star has $R\geq 1.41R_s$. If the equation of state is softer, then collapse will occur at smaller masses, and higher densities but at a similar multiple of $R_s$. Thus it is not necessary to compress matter within $R_s$ to form a black hole. The picture below (from Demorest et al. 2010) shows the mass-radius relations for a wide variety of equations of state. The limits in the top-left of the diagram indicate the limits imposed by (most stringently) the speed of sound being the speed of light (labelled "causality" and which gives radii slightly larger than Shapiro & Teukolsky's approximate result) and then in the very top left, the border marked by "GR" coincides with the Schwarzschild radius. Neutron stars become unstable where their mass-radius curves peak, so stable neutron stars are always significantly larger than $R_s$ at all masses. 

The answer is no, but not only for the reason you suppose. Each star probably does have a different chemical composition and hence a different spectrum. However, many stars have a very similar chemical composition, and those stars born in a cluster an almost identical composition. Therefore stellar spectra whilst having the potential to be a unique identifier, are not currently measured with sufficient precision to make this possible. However, another reason why what you suggest won't work is that by and large, we can only obtain spectra for stars inside a modest radius from the Sun, especially if the stars are near the Galactic plane. One could work in the infrared, but the spectra of bright stars are generally less distinctive in the infrared. You could go with a database of positions, absolute magnitudes and spectral types and probably work out where you were if it were reasonably close to the Sun. Note this only works if you are transported quickly (in terms of stellar evolutionary lifetimes). A better bet is to look at the positions of local group galaxies (e.g. the magellanic clouds, Andromeda), which will be in noticeably different positions. Also, globular clusters can play a role, because many of these do have distinctive chemical abundances and multiple populations and are distributed around the Galaxy and out of the Galactic plane. The pulsars idea doesn't work at all because: (a) The radiation from pulsars is beamed into a small angle, so they would not be visible in the same way from another Galactic location. (b) By the time you had got to another Galactic location (unless faster than light travel is postulated) some pulsars will have turned off, all will have significantly changed their pulses and periods, since the total lifetime of the pulsar phenomenon is of order a million years.
