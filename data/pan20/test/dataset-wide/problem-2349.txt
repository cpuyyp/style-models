From the information I have gathered, it seems that technical down is simply 850+ fill power down and Coreloft synthetic use alternatively depending on the area of the body it covers. 

This procedure is explained in more details in REI's Removing Mildew and Sierra Designs 5. What is mildew and how do I clean it off my tent? tent care sections of their respective websites. 

In practice, how precise is a pedometer for estimating your progress on a trail? For example, if I'm to hike 10 miles, how far should I expect to be from the 10 miles marker? Is there data comparing pedometers accuracy with GPS? 

I lean towards light and fast dry running shoes such as the Lone Peak from Altra. This shoe goes under $100 on sale. It also comes with a gator-ready velcro at the back. There is no ankle support which I don't personally consider a problem. I've seen this shoe recommended at trail shops. They seem to be quite popular on long trails nowadays. I recommend avoiding gore-tex boots (they all have a giant hole where you put your feet!). Good boots will typically be slightly over your budget ($140+). 

Apply a treatment such as McNett MiraZyme or similar product. Mix 1 cup of salt and 1 cup of concentrated lemon juice with 1 gallon of hot water. Dry the tent in an area facing the sun Apply water resistant treatment 

When backpacking in a coastal region, you sometimes have access to both fresh water (e.g. a stream) and salt water (sea, bay, etc.). If you do not treat the water used for washing dishes, what are the pros and cons of using saltwater vs. freshwater? Is there one source that is less prone to contamination? The choice is easy if the shoreline is polluted or the stream is next to a privy (established or... improvised). However, when there are no obvious differences in water quality, which one would be more recommended and why? 

For backpacking I use a small razor blade to open packages. Trail Design Ultralight Knife works just fine although it sometimes poke my fingers when reaching for it in my pocket. Sometimes I carry a slightly bigger folding knife. What I usually miss the most is a good spreading knife for cheese / Nutella. 

Wind speeds will be slower close to the ground, you are less likely to be hit by a flying object, and are less of a target for lightning strikes. In the same vein, it is best to avoid stands of trees if possible because the risk of flying debris and lightning strikes are both higher there. If you cannot reach a permanent building, your best bet is to look for a cave, ditch, rock overhang, etc. Any of these will provide more protection than a tent or a backcountry lean-to. You will definitely want to put your rain gear on to protect against hypothermia, the same as you would during a severe thunderstorm. And bringing your first-aid/safety kit is a very good idea. A thorough outline of safety precautions to take while camping in extreme weather can be found here. 

If you want to keep the food in the tent you could use an odor resistant bag such as OPSak or NiloBarrier. NyloBarrier is very light and convenient. You could combine this with a Ursack as mentioned by @nhinkle. If you don't want to odor proof the food but would like rodent protection a cuben fiber stuff sack would do just fine. 

With my limited knowledge of German, I would personally consider other alternatives first. An altercation with a local with whom you cannot communicate with is not something I would look forward to. 

While backpacking, I usually carry 50 feet of spectra cord (2mm) to be used as part of my bear bagging system. More often than I would like, I end up having to untangle the line before being able to use it. Although my untangling skills are ever increasing, how can I prevent the tangling of the cord in the first place? A cord winder comes to mind. However, I'm also curious to find out about tips and tricks on how to properly store cordage when a winder may not readily be available. 

These stoves are for small twigs burning and works great as a cooking system. However, I do not have experience with their floor plates. As for the 'Inferno' it does a good job at fully burning the fuel/twigs and only leaving ashes. 

It is likely caused by iron in the pump or pipes. According to the Illinois Department of Public Health: 

You could also make a fire and try not to burn your footwear while drying it. You could use a hot rock to warm and dry the inside. Your mileage may very with this; I personally wouldn't consider this an option unless a pre-existing fire is already available. In addition, I would be more concerned to have my feet wet over a longer period of time. 

Expedition weight relates to the temperature rating and level of activity. It usually means cold and low activity. According to REI expert-advice section. 

From my experience, water resistant means that the item will survive a splash of water but not any form of prolonged exposure. Water proof suggest that it is 

For waterproof items, there is often an IP number provided which helps you understand the level of waterproofness the item offers. IP codes are widely used in the industry. For example, a E+LITE from Petzl is rated as IP67 per the manufacturer. IP67 means you can expect the light to work if it is submerged in water less than a meter for no more than 30 minutes. For outwear such as jackets, the bigger issue is that if your jacket is fully waterproof, you will end up wet from your own sweat. The balance between breathability, waterproofness and longevity of the material are all equally important factors in this case. 

I've used Dirty Girl Gaiters and MLD on similar shoes. I don't see any problems with those shoes. If you are only trying to keep debris out, I would consider the former. 

In my experience, mostly in North America, an X hour hike provided by a park service is typically given for the round trip unless stated otherwise. You can also confirm by looking at the mileage and elevation. For example, Red Rock provides round-trip hour estimates. For example, Turtlehead Peak takes around 3-5 hours for a round trip; definitely not 6 to 10 hours (at least for an average hiker). 

Yes you can definitely hike Zion/Bryce in May. In fact it is a good time of the year for hiking in that area. A sedan will do just fine for most trailheads. 

I would consider a polyester or wool liner before one made of cotton. Cotton is quite comfortable dry but not so much wet. Andrew Skurka has a lot of experience with vapor barrier and wrote a good article about it. How damp will it be is dependant on how well your thermoregulation is. I would definitely recommend trying your system before hitting the mountain. For me, vapor barriers are interesting on long, multi-months, trips. Just make sure that if you get cold on top of the mountain you don't end up cold and wet with your vapor barrier! 

Roll top dry bags are fairly common. They are usually combined with either a pack cover or a pack liner. The pack liner is commonly an over-sized roll top dry bag placed inside your backpack. A cheaper option is to use a trash compactor bag as a pack liner. They are usually cheap and easy to find in the USA. Usually, the trash bag is put inside your bag so that you can still use the backpack. A regular trash bag might be too flimsy. Heavy duty bags are great and cheap for this purpose. aLOKSAK can help you protect small items. My experience with the similar OPSAK over an extended period of time (month+) is that you eventually have to replace them because of the closure. Nylobarrier is an other option but it is only water resistant. 

The Hochschwab is a mountain range in Styria. You can find trail information with photos about this region in German or English using Google Translate. You may want to spend a few nights at the same hut to simplify the logistics. You could plan several day hikes from the same hut. There is a beautiful lake that people scuba dive in which is car accessible. The Brandenstein is particularly interesting because of its use of a cave as a pass on the top of the mountain. Make sure to bring a head lamp! :-) The website was suggested to me by a fellow local hiker. The language barrier will most-likely be a challenge. 

Their website has additional information on the specific product pages. (note, I'm definitely not a fan of their website!) 

Backpacker.com have a short article on the topic. In my opinion, there are other risk factors of bigger importance that I would try to address first. 

In Nepal there is Thorong La which is a high altitude pass in the Annapurna that is doable without, in my opinion, much experience. It is fairly popular trek and you will likely encounter organized groups even during the off season. There are accessible trekking routes with accommodations and progressive acclimatization. You will need to acquire permits and may want to consider hiring a Sherpa. 

You're looking for balds. They are quite common in the southern Appalachians. The Roan Highlands along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina are particularly beautiful. 

It is fairly common to store duct tape just below the handle of your trekking poles. This is my preferred way as it is always accessible. Some people prefer to wrap it around Nalgene bottles. An alternative you could also buy it in small square pieces instead of the typical roll. I usually place about 10 layers around each poles. I would not bring three yards of duck tape. I typically only need small pieces for minor temporary repairs (tent or feet). 

For USA to Canada flights, I have seen hiking poles being accepted (after a bit of explaining..) and refused (WestJet). If they are refused, you may be asked to go back to the luggage section which may end up making you or your poles miss the flight. In my experience it seems to vary on the carrier and the person performing the inspection. Because of these variables (and I sometimes use fixed length poles) I generally prefer not having my poles as carry on. 

Cuben fiber is not as durable as some other materials used in the construction of backpacking gear. In backpacking lighter often means less durable which is generally true for cuben fiber as well. A cuben fiber backpack will probably hold for 2000 miles (e.g, a thru-hike) but not much more. For this reason, there is now a hybrid cuben/nylon material which is a bit heavier (2.92 oz/sqyd) and more durable. It can definitely be expensive if you use it everyday for long hikes. Cuben fiber resists puncture and tearing relatively well. Not so much with abrasion and folding. I have a rock sack (for bear bagging) made of cuben and it is heavily beaten up. Cuben fiber is less durable than sil-nylon in my experience. It also depends on the application (tent, stuff sack, pack, etc.). Once damaged, it is easy to apply duct tape to it for field repair. You can also use cuben fiber patches. 

Some small fish species such as the Smelt are eaten whole. In some fish the appeal is in the flesh of the fish and are therefore gutted and deboned. Gutting can prevent some tainting of the flesh. Like deer, the guts can deteriorate the flesh faster. One factor can be how fast you will refrigerate/ice your catch? Another concern with specific types of fish is the content of the stomach (such as worms/parasites). 

Well established treks like the Annapurna circuit are rated by multiple trekking agencies. I would use those agencies rating as a reference point to differentiate between multiple well-established treks. For example you can compare the difficulty of different treks in Nepal according to Himalayan Glacier. 

I would make noise to confirm the bear is aware of my presence. I would try to gently get out of the tent and take some distance (10 feet / 3 meters) from the bear and tent acting normally. And I would wait it out. I ran into this situation once and this worked out just fine for me. Personally I would not use the shotgun or bear spray. If I had the bear spray with me, I would only use it if the bear charges towards me which is unlikely. I believe the key points are: 

Aluminium will crack in sub-zero temperatures. Many of them are built with a coating that may contain BPA. Often the composition of the coating is not disclosed. Plastic bottles can leach chemicals when containing hot or boiling liquids. Personally I would consider a collapsable water pouch such as Evernew or Platypus. I've used Evernew to slide down mountains in the snow. Neither those bottles offers this possibility. For hard metal bottles there's always stainless steel. 

Prefer non-canned goods because they are lighter, take less space and the resulting trash compacts better. You can find tuna packs too. You can roll duct tape on your poles or bottle. I carry a ziplock bag on me with some basic emergency items in it. I would consider changing the water containers with a gatorade/smart-water bottle and perhaps bring a foldable container (platypus/evernew). 

These permits are obtained for specific campgrounds and/or designated sites. In Jasper, exceptions exist for climbers which allow them to bivouac in specific cases. You still need to obtain a backcountry camping permit. 

GearScout blog post on Down is coming from Arc’teryx provides some insight on Arc'Teryx usage of down in their products. According to them, Arc'Teryx did not have down products in their lineup prior 2013. 

In those cases, the sack did prevent the bear from getting to the food in the sack. Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group (SIBBG) did investigation on Ursack failures during the 2007 season at Yosemite. 

I do not know of specific comic books other than Ultralight Backpackin' Tips which has cartoon illustrations. However it is far from a comic book. :-) WhiteBlaze features some comic strips about hiking/thru-hiking on their website. And others have also made some hiking-related comics such as Keith Roberts. 

This is in fact an annoying feature of Provincial and Federal parks in Canada. I do not know of any which do not have those rules. In fact, even if you are hiking the IAT, a 3000km hike, you must reserve in advance for the Gaspesie National Park in Quebec. I believe it is fair to assume that the New-Brunswick IAT portion traverses crown lands. In which case, I would be quite surprised that any crown land restrictions would be applied; even to a non-resident hiker. I've never encountered a ranger far out in the trails in Canada. In the past, at Cape Chignecto, I walked to the coast to get a better cell phone reception in order to reschedule my campground as I had arrived much earlier than anticipated to my mosquito infested campground. In practice, if it is not a holiday, I could had just walked to the next campground and take a gamble. A fellow hiker camped in the middle of the trail while doing the Fundy Circuit as he was losing track of the trail when night hiking. Not surprisingly, nothing happened. This hiker would also call ahead, multiple time, to change his campsite reservation depending on his hiking pace. It is quite an inconvenient policy for long distance backpackers. There are a lot of nice places to visit and footpaths outside of the national parks. For many of them, stealth camping is quite acceptable. If you get sick or behind schedule, I believe it is a quite reasonable explanation and I would not worry about it. I would not expect a harsh consequence from the rangers if you otherwise behave civil, polite and reasonable. I would also have no qualm asking them in person their opinion on the subject the next time you visit to get their point of view prior to your trip. I believe that the rangers are more concerned with overused areas and individuals cutting down trees or leaving trash behind. If you cannot hit your timeline, camp at dusk, leave at dawn, leave no trace. 

Foambark can cause contact dermatitis and is listed by aboutthegarden as one of many low-allergen to avoid in an allergen free garden. 

Some people will also wrap the outside of the the shoe with newspaper and elastic bands. I've personally never used this before. Before using the newspaper, I usually take a lightload towel and place it inside my shoe. I will than press on it using my foot and extract as much water as possible from the sole. I repeat the process until no more water is drawn and then use the newspaper. I also use the towel trick on the trail after heavy rainfall except without the newspaper. This helps not having to walk with two small aquariums attached to my feet.
