I’ve discovered in my parts box some rim brake pads that have been there for several years. Aside from age, they are in fine shape (some are new). Can I put these on my bike, or is there hidden damage? In other words, how long do stored rim brake pads remain safe? 

My question is: where can I find something that will screw into the threads in the base of the pump and somehow lead to a modern Presta pump head? 

Lately, I’ve been “enjoying” pretty much every weekend a 9km, 650m vertical ascent near my home on my touring bike (the average grade is about 7.5%). The grueling ride has turned out to be a lot of fun for me, in a strange way. I wondered what I might aspire to. Thus my question: what are the steepest, highest, most miserable road ascents in the world? I.e., what might be a fun long-term goal to work towards? 

Some years ago, I changed to Presta valves; for this I needed a new head. I got a Topeak SmartHead Bicycle Floor Pump Upgrade Kit, which is a replacement head and hose with a number of different adapters. Unfortunately, none of them fit this pump, so I just hacked off most of the worn-out stock hose and spliced in the Topeak hose (one of the adapters is designed for this). Every so often, the splice begins to leak because the stock hose cracks a little. This is easily repaired by cutting off another 5mm and re-splicing, but obviously that's not sustainable. Here are some close-up views of the threads, and also the gauge for ID purposes. That's a AAA battery for scale. 

Benzo already hit all the high points. IMO, it depends on the weather you get and the amount of coverage you need. I've had quite good luck with the seatpost clip on fender (SKS Xtra-Dry Rear Seatpost Fender). It can be adjusted up or down and moved out of the way if you need to hold the bike vertically. If that arrangement doesn't work for you (buy one and try it... they're easy to remove and return), then I'd agree with everything Benzo said... buy one you like and cut it with a hacksaw. 

After 20 years commuting on old/cheap bikes, I finally evolved up to a nice solid touring rig with cable disc brakes (Avid BB5). I love the bike and the brakes. They're much easier to maintain, replace, and adjust than my old rim brakes were (as a result, they are more effective more often). However, recently I have been getting a periodic pad-on-disc noise that I have had difficulty getting rid of. After the pads have been used a while and are say 1/2 worn, they seem to "stick" so that some part of a pad is touching the disc. This is especially true after a session of braking hard (usually at the bottom of a hill). Sometimes I can knock them loose by braking again or tapping the brake levers hard, other times, even that doesn't work. Today, I actually dismounted and tried to work the pads apart by hand because the noise was really bugging me and I was worried that the disc would overheat. Are those little springs that go between the pads the problem? Can I make them stronger somehow? I've tried taking the springs out and bending them out before reinserting them, but no joy there either (at least not yet). 

I have a square taper bottom bracket. How can I tell whether it is a J.I.S. or ISO taper with a minimum amount of disassembly? FWIW, it's a Ritchey from 2004. However, it would be nice to get answers that apply to other brands as well. 

I have a 2004 Jamis Aurora with a 52/42/30 triple and an 11-32 cassette in the back. 30x32 (25.3 gear inches) being the lowest gear is frustrating for the hilly terrain where I live (e.g., 7% grade average over several miles, with higher local steepness), and so I'd like to lower my gearing. I'd like advice on how to most simply do this. The basic problem is that replacing any given part appears to have cascading compatibility issues which may or may not be solvable, and I'm becoming confused. I do use the full range up to 52x11 (127.6 gear inches), but only on descents that are fast anyway, so I am happy to lose the higher gears and coast instead. There is essentially no level terrain where I live. Relevant specs (all parts stock in 2004): 

I find it easier to park my bike if I can remove one of its degrees of freedom, for example, prevent the wheels from rotating. An easy way to do this would be to strap one of the brake levers down. This would be for around 8–12 hours, 5–6 times per week. I have hydraulic disc brakes. The bike would be upright. I have a feeling that this is a bad idea. Is it? And if so, why? 

I'd recommend getting a cheap used aluminum frame bike (a beater), a good lock, and a bottle of oil. Then, I recommend you lock it on the street most of the time. I recommend cheap so that you won't worry about it while it's parked on the street. I recommend aluminum so that it is light enough to haul up to your apartment for those extended periods when you won't be riding it (also so it doesn't rust). It might take a beating getting stored outside, but if you ride it frequently that'll battle the effects of the weather (as will the bottle of oil). One of my schools (in the midwest) had nearly 100% outside storage for student bicycles. It snowed, rained, etc. But, as long as the bikes were used and maintained regularly, they ran fine. (The ones that sat for a long time eventually turned into piles of rust.) If you spend, say $150 or so, you'll have enough left over for periodic tune-ups on your cheapo from your local mechanic. Also, if you store it outside, you'll be more likely to ride it for quick trips than if you have to haul it up and down 4 flights of stairs. 

Big fat padded seats do work well and can be had rather cheaply. I have recently fallen in love with a Brooks leather saddle. It is basically a leather hammock built in the shape of a seat. They are expensive, so see if you can find someone's you can try before you buy. I stumbled into mine by accident but I know I will never ride on anything else. 

And another shot from the side. Notice how the bleed port is recessed rather than the bleed nipple you'd usually see on a Tektro brake. 

Googling this, I found a headset called FSA Gravity HS No. 55 SX Pro, which has the following specs: 

The other side of the nut is flat. Only the nut is threaded, and it's the only one that has flat sides for a wrench to grip. What I have tried so far is to grip the free end with a pair of pliers, but I didn't get a good enough grip to get the other nut loose. I have tried to push the axle out from the free end, including whacking it with a rubber mallet a few times, and I even tried to put my weight on the hub with the free end resting against the ground. The axle hasn't budged at all, as far as I can tell, and I'd at least like to have a second opinion before I try to hammer the axis harder than I already have. 

There's nothing on the axle where a wrench could find purchase. The nut and assorted washers that came off are these: 

In the latest episode of my disastrous bike maintenance attempts, I got a sub-standard torx bit that broke off in the bleed screw of my Tektro Vela disc brake caliper. Here's a sligthly overexposed picture of the brake caliper in question, the bleed screw is circled in red: 

I have Shimano M785 hydraulic disc brakes. It is easy to remove the pads and put them back in again even with the disc in place. However, resetting the brake pistons is tricky. I currently use a butter knife and two hands, which mostly works but is very awkward. All the directions I've seen for resetting pistons (for example) call for removing the wheel. I'd would like to avoid this step if it's not essential; it transforms pad replacement or access to the pistons from a quick 5-minute job to one that requires a workstand and may be dirty due to chain contact. For example, this is relevant when diagnosing issues that require resetting the pads more than once, or perhaps in a shop where time is money. Is there a tool or technique that will let me do it easily without removing the wheel? 

I live in a mountainous area, and so there are lots of opportunities for descending at high speed. I currently have a bike with drop bars, and when in the drops, I feel very stable doing this. I am now in the market for a new bike, and I'm thinking I might like to switch to flat bars. However, on my current bike, I feel quite unstable on the tops at speed. Can the new bike (it is a custom frame) be designed to feel and be stable at high speed (say, over 40 MPH) with flat bars?
