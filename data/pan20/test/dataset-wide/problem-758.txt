Per multiple models, most comets did become vagabonds. Estimates vary, but the lowest I've seen is 65% being ejected, and some estimate that well over 90% were ejected. Moreover, comets in the Oort cloud are ejected as well over time. The long period comets and Halley-style comets that we see are but a small fraction of the perturbed comets in the Oort cloud. Most perturbations result in escape rather than diving deep into the solar system. If other stars are like our Sun, interstellar space should be awash with escaped comets. 

The Earth loses mass because hydrogen and helium (plus other elements in trace amounts compared to hydrogen and helium) escapes the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth gains mass because incoming asteroids (most of them very small) impact the Earth's atmosphere; a few make it all the way to the surface of the Earth. Whether those incoming asteroids burn up in the atmosphere or make it all the way to the surface is irrelevant; the Earth gains mass. Whether the net result is a mass gain or mass loss is a bit up in the air; the uncertainties on both are rather large, and they overlap. The Earth might be gaining or losing a tiny bit of mass every year. That said, most research leans toward atmospheric losses being greater than mass gain from impacting asteroids, comets, and dust. Whichever is the case, it's a bit irrelevant. Even the most extreme upper estimates on mass loss or mass accumulation are incredibly tiny compared to the mass of the Earth itself. 

The problem isn't so much the Sun swelling in size. The key problems are that the Sun's luminosity increases over time and that the Earth is covered with oceans. The Earth will become uninhabitable long before the Sun turns into a red giant. Ever increasing luminosity will result in an increased surface temperature, which in turn will result in increased atmospheric water vapor. Right now this isn't a problem because increased atmospheric water vapor means more clouds, which increases albedo, which counters the effect of increased luminosity. There is another effect to consider, however. Water vapor is an extremely powerful greenhouse gas. At some point, increased surface temperature will increase atmospheric water vapor to the point where the increased greenhouse effect increases the surface temperature, which increases vaporization even more, and so on. A loop! And a loop of the very worst kind, a positive feedback loop. When this will happen is subject to debate, perhaps as short as 500 million years (Goldblatt 2013), perhaps a billion years (Kasting 1988), or perhaps as long as 1.5 to 2 billion years (Leconte 2013) in the future. 

Light pollution. Anyone who lives in or near a large city (that probably describes most of the the stackexchange network members) won't be able to see as many stars as someone who lives a hundred kilometers away from that city. Light pollution is a growing problem to astronomical observatories, even those very far removed from cities. Loss of visual acuity. If you're an adult, your visual acuity isn't as good as it was when you were a child. Visual acuity peaks between 8 and 15 years of age, depending on who you read. After 15, it's all downhill. Different levels of humidity, particulates, and air pollution. You will see fewer stars than nominal if you live in an area with high humidity, high levels of particulates, or high levels of air pollution. If you made such a change in locale recently, you will remember seeing a lot more stars than you can see now. 

You have the sequence backwards. Protostars ignite by themselves once their cores reach a critical temperature and pressure. The gravitational collapse that eventually results in protostars (and then a stars) oftentimes needs a little help from an external disturbance such as a passing star or a supernova shock. 

The above focused solely on first order ODEs involving a scalar function. What if the problem is multidimensional or involves higher order derivatives? The mathematics of the techniques described above can easily handle multidimensional data: Simply use the vector-valued time derivative. Since a higher order ODE can be converted to a first order ODE via an augmented vector-valued state, the same approaches used to address multidimensional data can also be employed to address higher order ODEs. There's a problem with doing this: It throws out geometry. For example, consider the rather simple first order ODE $\dot x = -y, \dot y = x$. The solution to this multivariate ODE is uniform circular motion. Applying Euler's method to this results in $$\begin{aligned} x(t+\Delta t) &= x(t) - \Delta t\,y(t) \\ y(t+\Delta t) &= y(t) + \Delta t\,x(t) \end{aligned}$$ The square magnitude of this new vector is $(x(t)^2+y(t)^2)(1+\Delta t^2)$, which is always greater than magnitude of the vector at the start of the step. This is not uniform circular motion. The solution obtained via Euler's method instead spirals out. Other techniques spiral inward. A geometric integrator on the other hand will somehow maintain the constraint that $x^2+y^2$ is a constant of motion. The above example showed why we don't want to toss geometry in a very simple problem. The geometry of Newtonian gravitation, along with much classical mechanics in general, is symplectic geometry. This is why symplectic integrators are of great concern. A simple example again, with Euler's method: Suppose the second derivative of position is given by some function $\ddot {\vec x}(t) = \vec f(x(t),t)$. Applying the basic Euler method against 3+3 dimensional phase space dictates that $$\begin{aligned} \vec x(t+\Delta t) &= \vec x(t) + \Delta t \vec v(t) \\ \vec v(t+\Delta t) &= \vec v(t) + \Delta t \vec f(\vec x(t),t) \end{aligned}$$ A simple change makes this symplectic: $$\begin{aligned} \vec v(t+\Delta t) &= \vec v(t) + \Delta t \vec f(\vec x(t),t) \\ \vec x(t+\Delta t) &= \vec x(t) + \Delta t \vec v(t+\Delta t) \end{aligned}$$ As is the case with the scalar techniques discussed at the start, Euler's method is a starting point rather than the end with regard to symplectic integration techniques. Symplectic Euler's method is rather lousy. But at least orbits don't spiral outward. In making an N-body gravitation simulation, the size of N (the number of bodies) is a key concern. Simulating a galaxy is a very different concern from simulating a star system. The techniques used in simulating the formation of a galaxy are very different from those used to develop a solar system ephemeris. Galactic scale simulations cannot afford to calculate all of the N2 gravitational interactions amongst all the particles, and because N is so large, it cannot afford anything more complex than very simple integrators. A star system model that does not calculate all N2 of the gravitational interactions or that uses very a simple integrator will by viewed in disdain. 

Because the potential energy due to self gravitation (and due to rotation in the case of a rotating object) at the surface of a cube is not uniform. This non-uniform energy distribution means the object has excess energy. This excess energy is minuscule for a cube the size of a die but is huge for a cube the size of a planet. The mantles of terrestrial planets are solid, more or less. (It is highly erroneous to think of the Earth's mantle as molten. It isn't.) That "more or less" is important. A better description is that the mantles of the terrestrial planets are elastoplastic, or perhaps even viscoelastoplastic. They deform elastically in response to short-term stresses and strains, plastically in response to longer term stresses and strains, and can even flow over even longer periods of time. This means that a cube the size of a planet will eventually deform into something close to the entropically-favored spherical or oblate spheroid shape. Gravitation and non-conservative interactions can shape very large and very diffuse objects into a shape that is markedly non-spherical. An interstellar gas cloud, for example, eventually collapses into a disk shaped object with a massive protostar in the center. Given the right conditions, an interstellar gas cloud initially collapses toward a spherical shape, but pancakes once enough material concentrates at the center of the cloud. Here volume is not anything close to a conserved quantity. Angular momentum is however close to a conserved quantity. This, coupled with collisions and gravitation, is what make such gas clouds collapse into circumstellar disks. 

Excessive heat loss during lunar night was not a concern; the astronauts needed sunlight to perform their EVAs. Excessive heat gain during lunar day was a concern, at least initially. Because of these concerns, all of the moon landings occurred shortly after lunar dawn. The first few lunar landings only lasted a couple of days, with the spacecraft lifting off the Moon's surface well before lunar noon. None of the feared consequences of excessive heating arose. The astronauts wore good boots. This enabled longer stays on the surface of the Moon in later Apollo missions. Even so, the practice of landing shortly after lunar dawn continued. Those early morning landings provided excellent relief of the terrain during landing and it provided the opportunity for longer stays on the surface of the Moon. 

Over very, very long distances (much, much longer than the distance to Andromeda), the cosmological expansion of space means that light is redshifted. How much light is redshifted offers a clue as to the distance to some remote object. We do receive a minuscule amount of energy from the cosmic microwave background. That radiation was not emitted by stars. It marked the transition from the very early hot and opaque universe to a cooler and transparent universe. The universe transitioned from opaque to transparent when the temperature dropped below 3000 K or so. Now that the light has an effective temperature of only 2.725 K. 

The torque-induced nutations are also cyclical motions induced by the Moon and the Sun. These are much smaller in magnitude and have a much shorter period. The largest of these has a magnitude of about 20 arc seconds and a period of 18.6 years. All other nutation terms have much smaller magnitude and have shorter period. The torque-free nutation would have a period of about 305 days if the Earth was solid. The oceans, the atmosphere, and the outer core alter this. The Chandler wobble has a period of about 433 days and a magnitude of less than an arc second. Because the Chandler wobble isn't as predictable as are precession and nutation, it's lumped into a catch-all category called "polar motion." The redistribution of water over the course of a year (e.g., snow on Siberia in the winter but not in the summer) results in a yearly component of the polar motion. There are lots and lots of other factors, all small. Polar motion is observed after the fact. 

You could do the same, but it will take some extra work. The Mars you see at some time $t$ was emitted from Mars several minutes earlier than that. You need to find the $\Delta t$ such that the distance between Mars at time $t-\Delta t$ and Earth at time $t$ is equal to the speed of light times $\Delta t$. One correction will get you very close, a second will get you even closer. Another issue is time. JPL uses its own time scale, JPL ephemeris time (Teph). This is a relativistic time scale. It differs from Terrestrial Time (TT) by at most a few milliseconds, so for most purposes you can use TT in lieu of Teph in your homebrew ephemeris calculator. TT currently differs from UTC by 67.184 seconds, and beginning in July (there's a leap second at the end of June), it will differ from UTC by 68.184 seconds. 

These simulations (which have become to be very good) and the plethora of exoplanets have pushed the theory of how planets form back into the “that’s funny” stage. ("The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not “Eureka!” but “That’s funny...”", a quote widely attributed to Isaac Asimov.) 

Equipment and humans did not suffer immediate damage given the short period of time that humans did spent on the Moon. One of the effects of mild radiation is increased risk of cancer (but that's a long-term effect). The men who went to the Moon (and they did go to the Moon) did indeed suffer increased cancer rates compared to the Earth-bound population.
