Assuming the recruiter is the same person that you submitted the application to then no you don't need to contact her to say you've applied. The fact that you've, well, applied will do that for you. 

It sounds very much like your manager had the same impression going into the project as you did, and that being the case I can understand why they might choose not to add the overhead of the full project management apparatus on to a small project. It's quite possible that they now realize their mistake but feel that it would be detrimental to the project to try and implement it now the project is already well under way. 

What your coworkers are doing is awful - they are likely doing it either to make you look bad or to make themselves look "better". A good manager shouldn't fall for this sort of playground rubbish since they should have a pretty good idea of how on top of your work you are. Unfortunately not all managers are good, and sometimes a good manager is just too busy and falls for it. It's really not worth addressing this with the coworkers in question - they know damn well what they are doing and asking them to stop will likely just "confirm" to them that it's working. Instead, have a private word with your manager and ask something like: 

HR is not your friend here. I'm not trying to be harsh but I assume from this and the previous question that they can indeed rustle up some "user complaints" to "justify" the PIP if they needed to. I don't mean to imply that you are bad at your job here - just that anyone in a customer facing role is going to encounter negative feedback from customers in one form or another and for whatever reason your manager appears to have chosen to hang you out to dry. If (as you say) your manager's boss is on good terms with her and will accept your manager's version of events then that's a dead end as well. Honestly I don't think the situation at this employer is going to be salvagable for you - PIP's are often seen as step 1 of the firing process, and in any event are generally very difficult to recover from. And without a supportive manager I'd say your odds of surviving the PIP drop to near zero. I think Snark Shark nailed it - now is the time to be polishing the resume and getting on the job hunt. Obviously keeping your head down and complying with the PIP-conditions at your current place in order to keep that valuable "employed" status as long as you can. 

Generally speaking you don't need to do much other than provide moral support in meetings like this. What it would be worth doing though is looking up any procedures or regulations regarding the handling of the redundancy process for both your company and your location. This way you can be there to make sure that the process is being handled fairly and above board - it can be hard for the person who is actually going through the redundancy to think clearly enough to spot these things themselves. 

That's a really tough situation, especially if you don't know the full root causes of your manager's problems. How to best to handle it will depend on the sort of relationship you have with your manager. Colleagues If your relationship has little-to-no personal dimension then it's probably not something you can really approach directly. That doesn't mean you can't be of some help though - in simple terms you need to try and lighten the load. If you know if tasks they have building up that you can take care of you can offer to deal with it for them, if there are decisions or questions that you can resolve without needing to involve them (and you have the authority/autonomy to do so of course) then do that. As I'm sure you'll remember from your own experience when you are up to your eyes and teetering on the edge of burning out getting even the smallest of things of your plate can help massively. Some quick Do's and Don'ts: Don't seek out any credit or rewards for doing any of this, otherwise your noble intentions could be easily misconstrued as an attempt to seize on their percieved weakness to further your own goals. Don't bring the topic of their possible burn out up directly with them (unless they give you a very natural opening) - there may be things going on in their private life that they would much rather keep out of the workplace and if they are in a bad enough state of mind with personal issues that they are in pure white-knuckling-it mode to keep going at work you risk seriously upsetting them or bringing the whole house of cards crashing down. Do make use of others in the team if you can - try not to bring up the context of the manager's burn out but try and head off problems before they get to him where possible. This applies not just to the decisions and questions I mentioned earlier but is especially valid for the sort of petty, meaningless trivialities that seems to be [i]de rigour[/i] in most offices - "Wah! Jimmy turned down the air con *again" and I'm cold" that sort of thing. "Friends" Only you can really know if you are close enough to your manager to do this or not but if you think you are then you could approach them and ask if they are doing ok and if there is anything you can do to help. Unless you know them very well and are reasonably certain as to the reasons why they are feeling this way I'd make it clear that you aren't there to pry, instead you are there to listen and help if they want it. To minimise the potential for any shame/embarrassment they might feel and to maximise the chances of them opening up to you make sure you do this in private and when you are reasonably certain that there can't be any interruptions. End of the day when most people have gone or at the start before people arrive is probably best for that sort of chat. EDIT: Just seen the OP's latest update saying they are strictly co-workers and haven't known each other long so the "Friends" section doesn't really apply here, I'll leave it in for now though as it may be useful to others but can remove if required. 

The lack of a deadline isn't something that I'd worry about - it's not uncommon to have a fairly open-ended situation. Lack of contact details may or may not be an issue - as you touch upon in your post it may be to prevent them being spammed by applicants, I assume that there was a way of applying through the site that listed the ad? In that case I'd take it that they are wanting to funnel the applications through that process. Out-of-band applications and details are a pain for hiring managers to deal with and tend to be more annoying than useful. 

It can do yes.. by being currently "employed" you are already seen as being inherently employable. The circumstances surrounding your unemployment will likely mitigate this effect somewhat as you have a very good reason for being unemployed that doesn't reflect upon you personally and you can explain that in your cover letter if it comes to that. 

Assuming he's not a jerk he'll probably take it on board, I'd expect a few slip ups if he's used to to saying these jokes as part of a long-standing culture and you might need to remind him that they aren't ok but if he's still telling them more frequently than that (and importantly if it's frequently enough to bother you) then you can take further steps, you can talk to his manager: 

Again this shouldn't be a surprise - if someone is "ultra-busy" with their actual work then they are unlikely to be taking time out of these tasks to look at something optional, even if it was something that they would otherwise have wanted to have input on. 

is much more positive and get's your manager thinking along the right lines i.e. about what they are getting for their money. 

The notion that "Bob" was trying to deliberately sabotage the negotiations in order to get the business for his friend's company is, on the face of it, quite a likely one. It is however relatively hard to prove and therefore take action against Bob on directly. However the fact that his behavior in insulting the potential partner's representative was damaging to the company's interests is much clearer and something that is definitely due some form of disciplinary action (his intentions or lack thereof are irrelevant there) - it's not acceptable or professional behavior and there will likely be terms in Bob's employment contract that expressly prohibit doing that sort of thing, especially given that Bob was acting as a representative of the company given that it was a trade show. So what Mark needs to do is get a meeting set up with Bob (if Mark isn't Bob's manager it would be best to get them to do this instead) in order to investigate the allegations that Bob was behaving unprofessionally and contrary to the company's interests at this trade show. Mark's company likely has it's own disciplinary procedures so the exact process will vary but I imagine it will essentially consist of whomever is running this meeting presenting Bob with the fact there have been multiple reports of what he said/did and asking him to explain himself (which I doubt he'll be able to do satisfactorily) and from there disciplinary action can be taken according to the procedures the company has in place, assuming this doesn't result in firing (in some companies/jurisdictions you can't go from 0-Fired without some extremely egregious circumstances) it would have to be accompanied by a rather firm warning that such behavior is unacceptable and that any future recurrences will be viewed very poorly. 

The problem is that fundamentally volunteering has to be their own idea and if they aren't the sort to step up without being prompted then the closest you are likely to get is to have a meeting/email chain/IM chat/whatever about organizing the party and ask the question to the group in a general way. eg: 

"Class rank" isn't really a common thing in the UK so it would be very unusual to see on a UK CV, instead you would just list the grade or score. Unless the course was particularly difficult and prestigious (and your intended hiring audience would appreciate both those aspects) then I would leave it off. 

This is the first problem - I'm not saying you should believe in the project, instead I'm saying that whether you "believe" in it or not is irrelevant. You're an employee of a business not an acolyte of a religious order. By putting so much emotional weight on to your work you are not only feeling each setback harder than necessary but you are also getting in your own way and almost certainly being detrimental your own work performance:
