A violent agent that is stronger economically or militarily, or enjoys an external (interstellar) support, subjugates its neighbourhood, depriving planets of any external sovereignty, and (in case of a victorious government) possibly annexes and colonizes them outright. Some combination of planetary (domestic) sovereignty and a centralized “interstellar superpower” controlling outer space and space trade, likely by space navy, but restraining from conquest and extortion of developed planets in its space (think various “great unions of planets” in fiction). A confederacy of racially diverse and economically rivalling states seeking primarily to deter wars, to protect their common outer space from piracy and invaders, and to resist a blatant external interference in general (think Iroquois League, with a correction for racial diversity). An advanced interstellar system of relations, based on numerous treaties, maintains a complicated political balance and legal space in a large volume of physical space (along the lines of United Nations and Earth’s superpowers, or other known systems of international relations). A huge democracy effects a (nominally) undivided sovereignty over a large volume of space. An oligarchy of industrial or merchant corporations, with their space fleets, suppresses and subordinates weak territorial- and/or racial-based governments (popular or else). Some novel form of government based on a powerful conscious agent: specially designed governing computer (likely distributed), collective consciousness of individuals, or some mental power we now can’t explicate. Makes the problem of “sovereignty” moot. No stable structure at all: persistent wars, coups, rebellions, alliances and infightings, ever expanding and fragmenting empires and dictatorships. 

Evolution is like culture. Separate things, they change. Just look at Darwin's exploration. Different islands, different birds. The biggest variable here is time. 500 years won't prolly cut it, however, if one species is living on Mars, as you said, then they would probably want to adapt to Mars climate. More cold resistance could make reproduction different to a feasible degree. Lighter gravity means a lighter bone structure, and taller people. Given maybe 1000 years, they would almost certainly be different species. One would be redder, taller, more cold resistance, and more impact resistant, but only by a small amount. The other would be us. But they'd work together just fine for a long while. 

Yes, but it could be argued otherwise rather easily... A single cell of such a size is, in my belief, totally possible, but not necessarily likely. To tart, we would have to consider the various parts of a cell and decide if at such a size they wouldn't be organelles any more, but rather organs. 

With bones, the creatures would be very like us, but capable of holding a larger weight, thicker bones, etc. They would be skinny with double jointed limbs. To fit into the shell, they would simply curl into the fetal position. They would have to have eyeholes in the shell, or else some sort of tremorsense, to detect things. They would also have something on bottom, like my first example, something hard like shelled feet. This would be used as a sea snail uses its plug, and a hermit crab its large claw. Something protective from the bottom, and possibly equipped with a deterrent like claws. On the other hand, more turtle-like, they would have to include stunted-looking pre-folded limbs, and rather stubby. 

Please, give assessments of my types of formations from different perspectives: humanistic, liberal, Realpolitik, and economical. Which transition scenarios between different formations can be envisaged? Which scenarios of clashes between such formations (both of similar or dissimilar structure) will be plausible? 

Let’s consider the typical setting of 20th-century science fiction writers, both Western and Communist. Namely: 

Which political structure can be sufficiently stable in such conditions? Very likely, a typical developed planet or other astronomical object will not have significant pieces belonging to more than one sovereign state (that does not preclude some states to extend authority to several planets), and, in most situations in outer space, a state will maintain its sovereignty over its spaceships. I.e., a situation similar to modern Earth with planets/moons instead of islands (divided planets will become an anomalous condition), and spaceships instead of vessels. On one hand, different planets in a stellar system typically have different physical conditions (most notable, temperature), and we can expect that their populace will differ (remember several civilized races) as well, both biologically and culturally. On another hand, some central authorities will probably exist in circumstellar spaces. But how the two could be related in cases of heterogeneous populace in vicinity of one star? Some possible formations are: 

I, an undergraduate god majoring in worldbuilding and accelerated evolution, have been tasked with a simple yet sophisticated job, in lieu of a senior thesis paper. My task: design a world populated with macro-life, which must get them to the point of space-travel as quickly as possible. I have 4 billion years on my hands, but I need to use as little time as I can to accelerate these organisms to this point. Limitations: 

There does not appear to be a discernible male of the species. Question: How would evolution cause these creatures to come into existence? 

In a couple of games, you encounter a creature or two that regrows limbs immediately after losing them, not necessarily the same kind or aesthetic of limb. You shoot the creature, it loses an arm, it grows a horrible mutant arm, you shoot it again, it dies. TLDR: how do you make a creature, or evolve one, to generate new limbs, but automatically and instantaneously, and not necessarily the same type? 

The question is, as it always is with evolution, and pardon me for having a shorter answer than most people, "Why would they want to?" Of course, the answer that comes to my mind is "to survive." Can this creature do better than other creatures in that they can't harm it and neither does anything else? Can it reproduce as much as it wants? Is there enough food? When all those questions have an answer of "yes," then it stops needing to evolve. Consider Angler fish. Top of the food chain, pretty hardy, don't need to change that much. If they don't need to write to get better, they won't. If they can evolve luminescence of their own, or whatever, and it's necessary, it will get done, but otherwise not. I'd say that it would be pretty darn similar to what we have here: If you're the best in your zone, stay that way. 

All guys saying “you need 10blah-blah joules to achieve it” lie (although Ī am not astonished with their impunity, knowing how StackExchange works). There are two aspects of their lie. First is an assumption that inflicting a catastrophic damage to Solar System requires gravitational unbinding of Sun. Not so: red giant stars (BTW, a prospected stage of our Sun in few billions years) routinely shed circumstellar gas shells that could incinerate planets, such as Earth, with ease (albeit having only millionth parts of the star’s mass). Second is ignorance in nuclear physics and composition of Sun’s core. It contain a sizable amount of 4He that can fuse to 12C and other its nuclear “multiples” really fast. This would inevitably result in a cataclysm, although not immediately due to poor thermal conductivity of (usual) stars. Why this appears to never happen to main-sequence stars? The answer is simple: because there is no natural cause to ignite 4He prematurely, i.e. before an orderly transition to the red giant stage. If the mad scientist possess some energy beam weapon able to penetrate the Sun down to the core and concentrate its energy output in a small volume, then there is plausible that helium flash can be initiated. 

In my universe, which I am starting far away from this one, I have a planet of humans. Regular humans. On a planet identical to earth. (So no "magic" answers.) I want these people to associate the smell of lavender with violent, dirty, or otherwise 'wrong.' Whenever there is a crime or if for some reason someone wants to advertise a crime, they dump lavender oil in the area, and people know that something is bad. This has a multitude of purposes. Question: How do you make (however you please, within the bounds,) a smell associated with wrong? 

Give it a differed language! Living separately means living with things that need new or different names, and words that have little meaning, (Ocean, snow, mushroom, things that aren't in deserts,) not sticking around. They have a totally different set of things that 'matter,' and thus, things to be talked about. 

Mylar! That's what you use for blimps, and this is a blimp of sorts. More or less cheap, darn light, and good at retaining air. 

Whatever bad thing is in their nature, they must be closely guarded on that front. The real question is, why in the heck would someone 'upload' a personality with bad traits at all? On the 2nd front, the 'new guy' shouldn't have any of the stuff of the former, unless it has the former's memories, too. This would be so awkward in general as to get the whole thing banned before it could start.
