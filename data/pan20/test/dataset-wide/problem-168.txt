At that density swimming is more like burrowing than anything we would think of as swimming. With a viscous material minimizing drag is important, but it does not need controls surfaces or much in the way of fins really just muscle mass, the magma is not going to flow around them much when they push against it. This means they also need an extremely streamlined head more like a burrowing animal except even more pointed. so you have two likely body plans, either a limbless creature like a burrowing snake or sea snake OR you have a compact body with short powerful limbs more like a mole. You could even combine the two with something like a Bipes. Of course you also have to consider how they get in or out of the magma, since there will be a layer of cooled solid rock no matter how they enter or exit. 

Savannah can handle less rain than is needed to support forests especially very seasonal rain, savanah can hand long dry periods better than trees. Grass can die off and recover every year, trees don't handle this as well in warmer climates. so dry warm climates will develop savannah as long as grass have evolved. Also savannah are not without trees it is just that there is large distances between trees or patches of trees. Savanna are also often prone to fire which helps keep shrubs sparse. You really do not need to justify savannah on your planet, savannah will fill in anyplace the trees have stayed sparse and/or small because of the lack of rain or poor soil water absorption, again provided it has evolved. A common form of savannah is grass or scrub cover the majority of the land and trees are tightly packed near any water sources like rivers, lakes, or lowlands where water will collect. These are called gallery forests. Notice how much grassland exists in the picture below. This would qualify as a savannah. 

snakes can hear, they still have an internal ear, which is the complex part, they also have an ear bone, they just lack an external opening/connection. That could easily re-evolve the that, it would be far easier than re-evolving forelimbs. They just have to realign the ear bone to contact the skin instead of the jaw. 

There were dinosaurs with whip tails. Modeling shows a very dangerous weapon. for the structure of a whip it is important that it taper in width across its length and it must start stiff and get more flexible as you go along until the end is as flexible as rope. this is how a small strong motion gets transferred into a large fast motion. Some has proposed that the end of the tail would have been covered in a long modified flexible scales since the tips is what takes the most punishment, and other preserved dinosaurs show some really strange scale structures so such modification is easily possible(quills in psittacosaurus weird back scales on Brachylophosaurus). 

No mostly becasue pure aluminum and pure iron and pure glass are useless Non-additive glass in general is a poor choice for almost anything except optics. You certainly would not want to build anything out of it. Pure iron and pure aluminum both corrode very easily, they are also both soft and weak, if you built a telephone pole out of either it collapse under its own weight. there is a reason we use nothing but alloys. The brinell hardness of pure aluminum is 15 and the pure iron is 20-30 depending on crystal structure. For comparison electrical copper is 42 and mild steel (0.05â€“0.25% carbon) is 120. But you could easily make a show city where those four elements are very prominent. 

If you try to resist the flow you die, period. Getting pushed along with the flow is slightly more survivable, in the sense that getting hit by a freight train then dumped in a fireball is more survivable than getting thrown in an industrial meat grinder. Worse as as shield volcano the rare pyroclastic flow will be mostly explosive flows, which do things like this. That was a tree. You are basically asking for a portable ground zero nuclear blast shelter. 

The only reason green pigment is rare in mammals is most mammals can't see green, so mammals lost the "green" pigments pretty early. It all started because existing pigments could not make hair green, the blue pigments (tybalt blue) used in skin and feathers don't work in hair,(most animals make green by combining blue and yellow) so if mammals had wanted to be green they would have had to evolve a new pigment, without color vision there is little reason for this to happen. Note this is why green still occur in eyes. The existence of better color vision in primates has led to a greater diversity of coloration they have blue skinned primates, but they still can't get blue or green hair. It is entirely possible they may evolve a new green pigment (that is how they got better color vision than other mammals after all), it could even be a mutation of an existing pigment. Maybe they don't make red or yellow pigments anymore instead making new pure green pigment. As for why this mutation would spread you have three options, although you could combine these as much as you like. 

Short answer results of evolution and maybe some cultural stuff. Life on diffrent world is going to be very different, we don't know how much chemistry we will even share in common, but we do know many biological products will be unique to their worlds. If we share some basal genetics, unlikely I admit, then all of earths genetic diversity is valuable. but even if we don't there will still be a great deal of interest in research. Food, this depends a lot on biology if we share some basic macromolecules then foods would tradable and many would be unique to each world, milk and milk cheese are almost certainly be unique to earth. If the macromolecules are different you could even have the dieters dream, food that has pleasant tastes but due to differences in metabolic pathways have little to no caloric value. The sky is the limit depending on how different you make them, "Oh you have to try these cow teeth and birch bark I got from earth they are amazing, so crunchy and delicious". Flavorings and drugs, Larry Niven's draco tavern messes with the idea that one trader makes a fortune off unique flavors of liquors from different worlds. Each world has different flavors becasue they start with different things, Earth has Gin and Beer but maybe X has something that has a flavor we can't even describe becasue it is too different. Spices would be another option as would drugs, maybe riboflavin is their nicotine or their capsaicin. Other biological products, anything biological has a chance to be unique to one planet. Earth is likely be the only world with feathers for instance, they are just too unusual of a pathway to happen a second time and there are other things that may not evolve on other worlds. Silk or wood could be unique to earth, both might be high demand products. Maybe the aliens have a life form that makes something like foam leather or natural plastic that is valuable to us but ubiquitous to them, maybe earth plants make the the best paper or really cheap ablative reentry plating(not as funny as it sounds, oak paneling is amazing reentry plating, it is just only good for one use) maybe all their animals have scales so earth leather is better for certain things or maybe strawberries are the perfect source for one of their expensive hard to synthesize cosmetics. Pets and the like, maybe they just think rabbits are awesome or really think crickets are amazing. Exotic plants and animals have always had a market. Novelties, humans certainly like to steal cultural artifacts from each other why not aliens, then you have cultural fads. Maybe hair is in and humans make the best wigs or the tridions really like impressionistic art, or disco, or human coins. 

Your big problem is if you start adding and taking away weight from a climber you throw off its balance, a rider will drastically shift their center of gravity and widens the animal, making steeper slopes much more difficult. breeding for size is not an issue, but drastically shifting the center of gravity and widening the animal is, especially for a goat like climber. put 50 degrees as your max and you will have much more success. 

Camouflage, maybe they live in a jungle or somewhere else green blends. Sexual selection, maybe it is novel enough that mates find it attractive instead of repulsive, considering all the other weird things that sexual selection has produced this one is easy. maybe the new pigment is actually better at protecting the underlying tissue than the previous pigment. maybe it reflects the ultraviolet end of the spectrum better which is what makes it green. 

Not a lot, digestion is already incredibly efficient and methanotrophy requires oxygen which means you have to get the methane into the bloodstream, which will require energy, and will not produce much ATP. the real kicker is energy density and how much we produce. A human produces at max about 10 milligrams of methane a day. Methane has an energy density of 53.6 MJ/Kg, so all the methane a person produces in a day yields about 0.0128 food calories. For comparison there is about ~10 food calories in a single potato chip and about 3.5 food calories in a single oyster cracker. 

Social behavior, we know for instance that social primates will not accept extremely uneven sharing. Anything more than about a 3/5th diffrence is rejected. Being able to tell how many of your social group are present can be equally important. Especially if comparing your group to another group. math becomes especially important one you have the ability to communicate. Turn left at the many trees is not as good as turn left at the three trees. More basic keeping track of predators or dangers could be useful, how many wolves went into the cave vs how many came out can be important.

The human hyoid and larynx is very unique in position and shape and is essential for speech, changing it drastically will likely prevent speech entirely. But let's be clear humans have one of the widest vocal ranges known outside birds, we can roar it just not what you want. Humans can produce a "roar", it is not a complicated sound. We just do not have the volume, lung capacity, or resonating chamber to make one that is actually intimidating, ours are not deep, loud, nor prolonged. Basically a singer with a deep bass regularly produces a human roar. Gorilla can roar they would be your best model for the getting humans to roar with the least change, but will likely result in the loss of speech as well, especially sounds in the high pitch ranges. So no matter what you do roaring as I think you want and speech are probably incompatible in a human throat and jaw (possibly at all), so how human are your humanoids. Ossification itself is not essential for speech, children with unossified hyoids can still speak although it likely lessensen their range and may not work in a larger adult larynx where the hyoid is subjected to more stress. 

You might want to watch this talk, for ideas. $URL$ It's not going to be as hard as you think the hardest part will be making her tools to make her tools. It will probably only take a few years assuming she has some handy farm land, and most of that will be growing time. Basics She will need to make a stone axe becasue she is going to need one or two buckets, quite a bit of lumber,and two smooth flat boards. She will need a stone knife for carving. She is going to need a cup or two for mixing, clay would be best. She needs to harvest a bee hive for wax and possibly honey. She is going to need a lot of various size rocks. including at least one dished rock for grinding. Paper She is going to need a bucket, two flat smooth boards, and a lot of rocks to grind the pulp and press the boards, the more weight the better. If the can lever up a small boulder that will work better. She is going to need sand to polish the pressing boards or she can harvest and smooth slate if she can get a quarry to agree to let her. She needs a screen which means she has to make her own thread, although long hair (horse or human) would also work, but she is going to need a lot of it. the screen frame can be made from wood branches She is going to need fiber for thread and pulp for paper, Flax will work for both of these, It's fairly easy to grow and process, and it can be used for both. Processing it can be done entirely with wood and stone tools up to the screening step. She can also harvest paper wasp nests and cotton as additives to make slightly better paper and thread. If she wants really white paper it gets a bit harder her best bet is to make it with fly ash, If she considers scavenging it from a coal plant ok its fairly easyto get, If she has to harvest and burn the coal to make it herself she is going to need to harvest her own coal which can be done by hand or with her stone axe. She will need a lot of it. Then she is going to need to harvest some clay and wood to make an earth oven to burn it and harvest the fly ash. Pen She can work with a simple pen made from a feather (search the woods), and some wax and thread. Plenty of youtube videos on how to do this. Ink Ink can be made fairly easily from eggs, honey, and soot. If she insists on squid ink then she needs to make a fishing spear and/or net and go catch several dozen squid, octopi, or cuttlefish depending on size. there are youtube videos on how to harvest it, you just need a knife and a container. binding She is going to need thread and wax or glue, we already covered all this except for glue, if she can find a dead deer by the road she can cut the hooves off and use the oven to make a workable animal glue although any hoof, claw, or leather will work. The bones will come in handy for other tools as well. The glue does have to be boiled for a long time, which means she will need some kind of earthenware container.
