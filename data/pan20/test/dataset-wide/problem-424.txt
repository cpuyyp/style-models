I think you need to specify first what the alien brains are like and how the aliens think. Then you will be able to depart from humanising their language. 

Well - I'm going to modify my answer! In fact you can measure the value of a star in terms of mass! Use Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2 If the star gives out a steady amount of heat and light then that is measurable as energy. Energy is useful - for example to the inhabitants of the local solar system. If they could somehow rent out the energy of their star to other civilisations, they could derive an income from it. This could be measured from m = E/mc^2 Important They are not using the mass of the star as a standard, they are using the mass equivalent of its energy output. EDIT Unintended consequences: If the star went supernova then not only would the local population be destroyed but the currency would go wild. Huge amounts of energy would be released for a very short while and then this would die away to almost nothing causing a complete crash of the currency. 

Did Sanderson say how the springs were to be wound? This would take as much effort as the springs would release in use. Let's say horses were used to wind the springs, why not simply use horses to draw the passenger train instead? I suppose some forms of natural energy could be used, e.g. hydro-spring power instead of hydro-electric. Again though you have to transport the springs to point of use. Springs tend to be heavy. Transporting springs by spring-power seems self-defeating. EDIT Power out equals less than power in. Spring power was thoroughly developed when clocks were spring powered and clockwork toys were popular. A clockwork toy could go very fast but only for a minute or two. Undoubtedly it would be possible to have a large spring-powered drag racer. It would be under power for a few seconds. You could have a longer distance form of transport that ran as slowly as a clock. To get both speed and duration together would be impossible. 

You say it requires a power socket. If that is the case then you had better make the power socket the reference frame otherwise it will unplug itself as soon as it starts up. This may provide your solution. Reinforce the power socket and the lead and by that means tether the machine to the wall. That way it can travel in time but it will be prevented from travelling in space. Keeping the tether from breaking will be the tricky part. The wall end of the lead will be travelling forward in time at a standard speed of 1. The other end will be time-travelling faster or even in a negative direction. There will be a whole new theory of physics needed to work out how the speed of time travel varies along its length. If you can tether the machine to the wall socket then be careful going backwards in time because it will meet itself. If it stops, this will cause it to explode itself. If you are going forward in time make sure you are paying the electricity bill by direct debit and there's plenty in the bank. You don't want to get cut off. 

Let us suppose this island exists. What plausible explanation, based on studies of anthropology, can account for the tribal split? Questions 1. How did this come about? Why does one tribe always tell the truth? Why does the other tribe always lie? What momentous events in the history of the island caused this split. 2. How does the split affect daily life and how does it affect trade between the tribes? 3. What should the child of a mixed marriage between truthers and liars do? Should they lie or tell the truth? EDIT There are some close-votes on account of the answers being said to be a matter of opinion. I will therefore change the question to ask for scientific backup of answers. Are there any anthropologists who can comment on the validity of existing answers or give answers based on knowledge of actual studies that have been made of tribal interactions? Are there any cases of tribes that have a similar cultural split? Do they coexist in peace or are they constantly warring with each other? 

We are at war with the Clegg, a fearsome tribe of warriors. Both sides have typical medieval weaponry but explosives have not been invented yet. We are fighting over an area of fertile land that lies between our territories. When passing through a small village we discovered the beginning of a small outbreak of zombie-ism. Our commander - a very intelligent fellow - discovered from the villagers how this worked - it is passed on by biting. He captured all the zombies and has brought them along. They are kept in secure zombie-proof steel cages that are transported on wheels. The commander can create new zombies by forcing prisoners against the bars to be bitten. There is a limit to how many cages he can transport. The other side has no zombies - yet. Nor would they know what they were or how to use them - yet. The commander wants to use zombies as war weapons. Advantages 

There will be one mother of a tidal wave. How badly this affects anyone will depend on where they are. In the open ocean, the tidal range due to the sun is about 2 feet. That translates to a pretty big mass of water that will suddenly be dropped. This will be accentuated by tidal movement of the Earth's crust. All the normal tidal phenomena will try to happen at once and everywhere. Large sections of coastline will be washed away and water will invade the land disastrously elsewhere. Sorry no calculations here. The land/sea boundary is so irregular and the depth of the seas likewise, so a realistic simulation would require a huge amount of real-world oceanographic knowledge and some powerful computation. 

It is only possible if (a) there is a sound-based key (a recording of some type), or (b) a detailed anatomical description of the alien's 'mouth' and its operation. For example it is possible to get some idea of how a Roman musical instrument would sound by looking at an old picture or an archaeological find. This is because we have an idea of the physical appearance of the instrument and the fact that it has strings or there is someone blowing through it. On a slightly different tack but still connected: See just how difficult it would be even to understand it without a key, have a look at this $URL$ 

Since the invention of hard road surfaces, a centaur would need to wear metal shoes like any other horse-like creature. Can you see any barrier to a suitably qualified centaur (a) being a blacksmith/farrier and (b) shoeing him or herself when the need arises? 

Newton is not generally famous for that because it turned out to be a dead end. However had it had been factual he would have discovered the basic rules. We would now have university course on all aspects of magic except that it would simply be called science. 

... 3. Included in glass are natural forms of silica (with impurities): obsidian, lechatelierite, quartz, quartz glass, vitreous silica 4. Real Science: It's worth noting that, e.g. Obsidian already suffers a very slow type of glass rot before the glass apocalypse. This is the scientist's best lead so far in trying to find a cure. 

One way to destroy it would be to wind it in. This would pull the geostationary space station out of orbit. The cable(s) are designed with enormous tensile strength but resistance to shearing may not be good. Repeated missile attacks would weaken or even melt or snap it. You haven't specified the thickness and number of the nanotubes. If there are only a few and they are narrow, a good pair of bolt-cutters would do the job. The terrorists could use 9/11 tactics and simply fly a plane into the cables. Prevention would be a real problem. A large portion of the Air Force would have to be on constant standby. So would air traffic control in the area - both to avoid civilian planes hitting it by accident and to detect intruders. Personally I think it would be so unstable that simply sending a heavy load up would throw the whole thing out of balance and cause a catastrophe - imagine the collateral damage! The cables would act as a lightning conductor so there would have to be a way of preventing thunderstorms. On the other hand, if the cables are non-conducting then the process of going up and down would create a huge static charge. 

This already happens in Second Life where people can design their own appearance. Returning to Real Life though: Movie stars do live in a world of beautiful people. Some hook up with equally beautiful people, but presumably they have their own standards of who is more attractive. Line up a row of stars and then compare them in pairs. You will come up with your personal winner. Not everyone will agree with your choice. Not all men like blondes. Not all women like conventionally handsome men. Unless the world is full of identical clones there will always be something to compare, something to prefer. 

Please see my re-open request below (the question is currently closed). Thanks You come to realise that you are a fictional character in a story. 

Everything on Earth and in the Solar system is as we know it. However it is discovered that we live in a small but unbounded universe. That is to say if we travel far enough in a straight line we will return to Earth. You may be familiar with the classic Asteroids game that can be played here. If you fly off one side of the screen then you reappear at the other side. Scientists have discovered that we live in a cube-shaped universe. It is just like Asteroids but in three dimensions. We know that other versions of Earth (or rather Earth itself) are 1 light year away because we receive radio and TV broadcasts that were transmitted a year ago from the six different directions. Question We can see these 'other' worlds tantalisingly close but in fact it's like looking at the back of our own heads. Is there any use that humanity can find for this phenomenon or is there nothing to gain at all? What does it mean for science and space-travel? 

It depends on the direction of the strike. Head on, ships can be made incredibly strong. In ancient times, warships were designed for head on collision with other ships in order to sink them. Their masts were usually quite stubby however and the main propulsion came from the oars. 

It won't be very long before we can affect the development of embryos and switch on and off ancestral traits. It is entirely possible that we could in future selectively keep fish-like traits whilst maintaining the development of the human brain. 2. If going back to fish is unappealing then maybe we have only to go back to apes.
