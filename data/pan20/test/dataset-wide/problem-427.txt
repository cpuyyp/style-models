I'll confine myself to the question as asked. First, the political response will be one of outrage, particularly from those countries which had provided colonists among the unlucky 400. If the governor is American, the response will get particularly nasty. Wars have been fought for less (See the War of Jenkin's Ear), although that sort of thing seems to have gone out of style. The governor's survival will be a particularly sticky point, unless he can provide iron-clad proof that he took his chances along with everybody else. And since he had months to jigger the evidence, such proof is unlikely to be forthcoming, and there will always be a reasonable suspicion that he engineered an exception for himself. 500 choices is large enough that some statistical variations from the mean are quite likely. If the distribution of deaths is in any way favorable to any nationality or race, things will get very bad very quickly. An uptick of terrorism against the favored group(s) can be expected. Also to be expected is the rising of all sorts of conspiracy theories among the victim groups. Riots are a given. 

You can see where this is going. So let's say that young dragons, being typically immature, kill their siblings so that only half of any brood survive, although the first generation have a 100% survival rate. Then the adult population looks like 

Against earth-launched objects the ship is dog meat regardless of weapon. Assume the ship is in LEO, with an orbital velocity of roughly 7 km/sec. While the ship is on one side of the earth, on the other side a ship-killer is launched. This also reaches LEO, but going in the opposite direction. Its payload is several tons of ball bearings, which it disperses before coming into sight of the ship, and does so in several waves. Closing velocity is 14 km/sec. While radar might detect the cloud(s) of bearings, there is basically nothing that can be done, especially if the ship-killer deploys ECM to mess with the ship's radar. Even an H-bomb won't have much effect, since even if molten the bearings won't be deflected much and will still have their original velocity. Plus, of course, there are several more waves coming, and the first nuke will serve as an excellent ECM device in its own right. Or, just for fun, the killer vehicle can preemptively deploy a few nukes to mess up point defense. If you want to get even nastier, you can coat the ball bearings with radar absorbant paint. 

This doesn't work very well. What you have to realize is that the weapon has to decelerate just as much as it accelerated to get into orbit. This will take a great deal of fuel, so the final impact body will be quite small. The useful term here is the payload fraction. The Space Shuttle is good example. It takes a liftoff weight of 2,000,000 kg or so to put 130,000 kg into LEO, for a payload fraction of about 0.065. Apply that to a 1 ton (1,000 kg) "weather satellite", and you get an impacting body of about 65 kg. The situation is a bit clouded by the fact that you presumably don't want a multi-stage deorbiter, but it's clear that 65 kg is optimistic, not to say unrealistic. At 10 g's, retro burn time is only about 81 seconds and begins 32 km before the vehicle would pass over the target if there were no burn, so this is happening pretty much out of view of most radars. Furthermore, this simply produces a satellite which is (temporarily) essentially stationary and which then begins free-falling, and ignoring atmospheric effects will take about 157 seconds, with a final velocity of about 1500 m/sec. Of course, you can't actually ignore such effects, and descent will really take a good deal longer. In order to get an 8 km reentry velocity will require double the total thrust (8 km/sec to stop the vehicle, and another 8 km/sec vertical speed) - you can't combine the two if you want a vertical reentry. So the impacting body will be even smaller. Like, in the neighborhood of 4 kg. And it won't hit an anything like 8 km/sec - remember atmospheric drag effects. You're right, though, to think that there is simply nothing looking straight up over DC, so there will be very little warning. You may well feel that 1500 m/sec (about Mach 15) is pretty unimpressive. Well, that's because it is. Unfortunately, you'll get maximum impact velocity, about 8 km/sec, if you think of the final orbit as being a very slight ellipse, with closest approach being 120 km less than the maximum. Unfortunately, this will produce a very shallow approach angle which is in principle easily detected, not to mention producing a whole lot of drag and slowing your impactor down trementously. Fortunately for your story, the approach angle can be from the southwest, and there aren't a lot of radars pointing in that direction. 

Where is the UK now? I mean with respect to the Cretaceous period? (I'm not ignoring your question. I'm just trying to get you to think about how you define what, exactly, it is that you're asking.) It's not like there is some sort of grid pattern on the earth to establish, say, the Greenwich Meridian. The surface of the earth slides around, of course, but the interior, or at least the core, isn't a fixed ball, either, since it has currents. And the length of both the year and the day have changed during the eons, so you can't reference things to the solar system, either. For what it's worth, this map can be adjusted to show the relative outlines of the continents over the last couple of hundred million years, and it suggests that the current location of the British Isles sits on a latitude that hasn't had much water over the period of interest. How about this? The implants can be "locked" to an in-situ bit of rock or fossil, and will track it as the implant slides back through time. When the fossil separates into its parts (the living organism is assembled from an assortment of sources as it eats and drinks, so going backwards it will suddenly dissolve). If the fossil is a marine organism, of course, the implant will end up in the water, so you have to choose carefully. 

While not as impressive, Molotov cocktails made with 100% alcohol would be rather nasty. And, of course, they are entirely Green. EDIT - Actually, I think I missed a trick. Since this is The Future, after all, we can assume a few technological tricks are available. In this case, 3D printers allow making glass vessels of arbitrary design and cheap production. Also, cryogenic super-coolers are widely available and cheap. With these two assumptions, you can do really interesting things with an alcohol-based Molotov cocktail. Specifically, you can make a 2-part bottle. Half of the bottle is a normal container - the other half is a thermos flask. Alcohol goes in the normal part, and you use the super-cooler to produce liquid oxygen to fill the thermos section. When this sucker hits something and breaks, the results should be pretty spectacular. See $URL$ for a demonstration of how to get a charcoal grill up to heat in 15 seconds. Of course, you need a pretty sophisticated pressure relief valve on the LOX section, but that's what the Hypernet and 3D printers are for. END EDIT 

The best thing you can do is stay small. That's not to say poor, mind you, just small. As has been indicated, cash is not a good idea, due to serial numbers. Neither, oddly enough, are gemstones. Since you want to stay inconspicuous, providing a stream of gems which are exactly identical, to .01 carat, will sooner or later catch the curiosity of somebody. I assume you can afford $1200. That will get you a Gold Eagle nowadays: one ounce of gold and the most commonly sold (in the US) bullion coin around. And bullion coins are what you want, since basically nobody cares about anything except weight. You have not specified the exact inner dimensions of The Box, but let's start with 1" x 3" x 4". If this were filled with a custom ingot, it would weigh about 3.6 kg, or 117 troy ounces. At 1200 per ounce, that's about 141k. Since we're talking coins rather than a full ingot, you can only fit 48 gold eagles in this space (8 layers of 6 coins), for a total value (at 1200) of 57.6k. A day's work (3 duplications) will get you 172.8k. Nice work if you can get it. Staying small is a good thing in this case. Pay taxes on your gold sales, and maybe set yourself up with a small coin store as a laundering device. Run the box once a year. As an alternative format, get a few ounces of gold dust. Then move up to Alaska and buy a nice big tract of land which has a river which seems a good prospect for panning. Then start duplicating your gold dust, and if anyone asks, you hit the most outrageous lode in the river. Nobody is likely to raise alarm flags. Plus, as a bonus, when you decide to move on, you'll be able to sell the land at very good price to anybody who wants to see if you missed anything. Now, if you've got ambitions, you can find an outlet for all the gold you can produce. How much is that? Since a custom ingot seems reasonable in this case, your total gold production is about 105 million per year, assuming 3 duplications per day, working 5 days per week and taking 2 weeks vacation per year. This, while rather better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, is too much to hide, but too small to provide the corruption required to get the feds to overlook it. You might do well to move to a less-developed country, with all the problems (particularly security) which that entails. As a security measure, run up a few loads of gold and cache them in various locations, just in case. And start collecting cheap jewelry boxes. Everybody needs a hobby, and the Purloined Letter approach seems quite reasonable. In the real box, insert a wooden spacer in the box, then run the box. The result, until you remove the original and duplicate spacers, will be a box which is too small for your custom ingots - just in case someone decides to check.
