In a Push, Pull, Legs workout program, why do the arms get two days training whereas the legs only get a single day. The arms are far smaller than the legs so shouldn't there be less emphasis on them? Wouldn't it make more sense to split the legs up over two days, such as upper and lower, or leg push/leg pull or something, and then give one day to arms? 

In my opinion the best way to lose fat is by counting calories. It's great that you are eating healthy and often and such, however if you are still eating more, or the same amount of calories as you are burning; you will not lose fat. In order to lose fat you will need to create a calorie deficit, ie. Eat less calories than you are using. A deficit of 400-1000 calories a day would be typical for most people aiming to lose fat. The greater the deficit, the faster you will lose fat. However if you have too large a deficit you may become lethargic, have trouble maintaining your current strength and may lose some muscle mass. In order to know how many calories you are consuming a day you need to keep a log of all the calories you eat each day, there are plenty of websites, programs, apps that will do this easily for you. In a lot of countries packaged food is required to have a nutritional information label that will tell you how many calories or how much energy in kj (you can convert these two units easily, 4kj roughly approximates to 1 cal) is in that food. You can approximate all other food by weighing the amount you eat and then looking online for its approximate calorie content. (Google itself will show you the calorie contents of certain foods; If you google "calories in carrots" for example). Make sure you log everything you eat even healthy things like salads, it all adds up. Also make sure you overestimate or round up as there are many factors that could easily mean you consume more calories than you think you are. The next thing to do is to work out how much you are burning each day. This is most easily achieved with a heart rate monitor like a Fitbit or something, but again you can always approximate it yourself. The largest source of calories out will be what is called your BMR which is basically how many calories you burn by just being alive. You can approximate your BMR online with a BMR calculator. Then you can approximate how many calories you burn from any exercise that you do that day, again by looking it up online. Make sure you underestimate or round down to provide a buffer zone just in case you aren't actually burning that much as every body is different. Note that unless you're doing hours of high heart rate activities, the total calories burnt from exercise won't be all that much and you can probably just use your BMR for your calories consumed. Then simply make sure that your calories consumed each day (from food) is 400-1000 calories less than your calories burnt each day (from BMR and exercise) and you will lose fat. 

If you consider yourself handy then you could consider building some weightlifting equipment yourself. It is cheap and surprisingly simple. Although I do recommend that you do buy the barbell since making one out of wood or other common materials would be considerably weaker or larger if you try to maintain the same strength. Buff Dudes have a Youtube channel where sometimes Buff Dad has tutorials on how to make Gym Equipment. This is an example for a power rack. I've found that the procedure is quite simple and doesn't require any advanced tools. The material is mostly wood so it is very cheap. As for weight plates, there are again many tutorials on Youtube (this one for example) where people show you how to make weight plates from concrete. It's about $5 for a 25kg bag of concrete, so you could make ~30kg (some water is retained from curing, I'm not sure how much) of weight plates for only the cost of a bag and a mould which would be less than $5. Although it would take a considerable amount of time you could build yourself a home gym for a couple of hundred dollars. 

As your goal is to get toned I would suggest doing one exercise until failure and then move onto the next one (a short break or even none is best), until you've done all of them. Repeat this every 2nd day, if you're body is still sore you should consider resting a bit more. Since you seem to want to save as much time as possible it may be worthwhile making the exercises more difficult if you deem they are taking too long, or if they seem too easy. You can easily make any of these exercises more difficult by wearing a backpack with filled water bottles. Also as a side note, if you are looking to get toned you will also need to lose fat if you are overweight. The best way to do this is by eating less calories. Just my two cents based on my knowledge, hopefully it's somewhat useful. 

After starting lifting, or perhaps it was from bad posture at my desk job, I got what I think is a muscle knot and I'd like to know more about them. What causes muscle knots? On both a higher level and a deeper scientific level. Are there exercises or stretches or something that can be done to remedy muscle knots and why does it work? Does stretching before/after exercising prevent muscle knots? Is there any other way to prevent muscle knots? 

I went to a massage/body therapy place while on holiday for a massage and was told by the guy that I have the beginnings of a slipped disk. They didn't speak English very well but I believe they said it was either the c6 or c7 one if that makes a difference. What can I do to prevent the disk from slipping out? I recently started to do weightlifting regularly (bench press, rows and deadlift). Should I stop doing these, especially the deadlift since it involves the back? Are there exercises or stretches or anything else that I should or should not do in order to prevent/fix this? The person told me that it may be because of sleeping or sitting. What are the best ways to sleep for this problem? Would sitting up tall, with back straight and shoulders back while at work (desk job) or while driving be better? 

It's easy to see progress in a person's strength; they started at being able to bench x now they can bench x*2. The same is true for lots of strength exercises. What tests or measurements are there for muscle speed? I can think of some tests for muscle power which may be appropriate such as vertical jump, but I don't think it would be a good indicator of speed as strength is a large component of it. 

Yes it is quite possible to accomplish this, but not if it's pure(mostly) muscle. Keep in mind that they are still a teenager and as thus they are still developing and growing his body. A teenager can easily gain 5-10kg a year just through normal body growth. The fat and muscle that they gain on top of this could in total add up to the 25kg. It depends on how much fat they have gained, gaining fat is far far easier, than gaining muscle. An average adult male can gain muscle at about a rate of 0.25 - 0.5 pounds per week. For a 6 month period that works out to about 6kg. So assume they put on 5kg (a lot for a late teenager) from growth and they gain 6kg of muscles which again is quite a lot. That leaves 14kg unaccounted for which is possibly fat. Does your nephew look like he has gained a lot of fat? 14kg in 6 months seems like a lot of fat and it definitely is not healthy however it is more than easily accomplished. That works out to less than 0.6kg a week which can be very easily done if a person's food intake is too high. Even 25kg in pure fat is believable in a 6 month period. 

So I've started a new job and due to this I end up sitting for 12 hours a day. 8 hours at my desk and 2 hour commute each way. I know this is bad for me, especially my back. At least during work I can get up every now and then, but during my drive I feel a bit of pain in lower back so am now planning on doing stretches every day morning and night in order to prevent injury. Can anyone suggest some stretches that would suit me, bonus points if they can be done in the car. I have some stretches already that I am starting to do every day but would like to add some more specific ones to prevent injury from my long periods of sitting. 

I've seen this infograph that explains what load, reps, sets etc. you will need to do for each goal or aptitude: 

I read on this site that a full workout consists of a pushing exercise, a pulling exercise and a legs exercise. 

To clarify I'll provide some examples of what I mean by "holding": Say when you are doing a situp, you can hold the position part way through and then just stay there and it will work your muscles. Another example is holding a dumbbell horizontally, or doing a chin up so that your biceps are approximately horizontal and then just holding that position. Is doing exercise like this bad? Why is it never recommended to do this over doing the entire motion? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Are there dangers of holding? 

The only problem I can think of is one of weight distribution, once you add more and more you'll be shifting you're center of mass changing what muscles the exercise affects. I'd suggest using a ankle weights if you have them, or alternatively use another backpack but reversed so it's on your chest and load that with about half the weight so that you're more balanced. 

After failing to open a jar the other day it came to me that the strength required to do so is not built in most exercises and also that it is a common test of strength in daily life. Therefore I would like to do some exercises that will help build the strength necessary to easily open jars. What muscles/muscle groups are used in the opening of jars (I imagine grip strength is the main factor) and what exercises will help increase the strength of these muscles? Note I am not particularly interested in these sort of things. I'm more interested in more traditional exercises, body weight or free weight (bar/dumb) exercises that will also build the strength I'm looking for. I have a power tower, barbell and dumbbells with variable weights available to me. 

All food is the same after consumption. The food is broken down into energy and this energy, if it is not used, will be stored as fat for when your body needs energy later. The amount of energy in food is called calories. So the more calories in the food that you consume the more fat can be made as fat takes about 3500 calories in order to make one pound of fat. So if you consume more calories than you need you will gain weight in the form of fat. The amount of energy you need is known as your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) there are plenty of BMR calculators available online which you can use. This is the amount of calories that your body will use in order to keep you alive. Any exercise you do, you should add the amount of calories used from that exercise to your BMR. If that total energy out (BMR + exercise for the day) is more than the energy in (the calories that the food you consume contains) then you will gain weight. The opposite is also true. If your energy out is greater than the energy in than your body will use your fat in order to get the extra energy for that day. Resulting in your fat stores being consumed and expelled from the body, meaning you will lose weight from the form of fat. 

If you're trying to lose weight my suggestion is to focus on your diet. Focus on eating less calories than you are expending and you will lose weight. Exercise is great for your health but will do little (relative to dieting) for your weight. Since you're just starting to exercise I suggest not trying to do too much too soon as it may result in injury and frustration which could cause you to want to or have to stop exercising. To start with just walk. Go for a walk every single day. Start off slow and easy, just a short 10 minute walk or whatever, but slowly increase speed and duration until you are doing an hour or so walk. Once you can walk at a relatively decent pace for an hour without getting too tired then you should look at more intensive exercises such as swimming and running, also some strength exercises would be good. The point of walking every day isn't so much to give a decent workout but to form a habit of exercising. Once you've developed the habit it's far easier to progress with more challenging workouts.
