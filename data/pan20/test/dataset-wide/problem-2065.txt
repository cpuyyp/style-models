Then why should you give a notice to the company? It will never work well, and you gain absolutely nothing by speaking about your intention. 

Please ask yourself and your senior data scientists if the target performance is reasonable or not. For example, it's not reasonable to expect a 100% accuracy for the simple MINST data set. Assume the target performance is reasonable and your boss wants that to happen. Generally, you have the following options: 

Sounds like software engineering is not appropriate for you. I suggest you may want to jump into the finance sector. The Wall Street pays lot of money. 

I have no idea of your background, because it all depends on your skill sets and your bargaining power. In academics (e.g. computer scientist at PhD level), visa sponsorship is awfully common. That make sense because the job is really not something that everybody can do. In IT, you will need have very strong background history to convince visa sponsorship. UK, France, Germany and Australia have enough candidates for entry to middle level positions. You will need to prove yourself (more likely a senior position). If you did have the skills set, consider headhunters. Headhunters work with top clients (e.g. investment banking), those companies will more than happy to sponsor you if they believe you are unique. Answer You are free to ask for visa sponorship for any job position that you are qualfiied. However, expect rejection unless you have strong unique skills not available in the local market. 

You've been working for 30 years, so you wouldn't be young anymore. The company might want to make sure if you have the physical capability to deliver the tasks. 

The most common strategy for career switching is to go back to university, gain a degree say in finance, and then start fresh as a graduate programmer. Full-time master degrees should take you just about a year to complete. 

Unfortunately this is common in finance startups. I know it well because I was in finance. The finance startups can do that because: 

Sorry, working overtime in highly competitive places like Singapore is very common. You are not alone as many Asian cities like Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan are like that. There is nothing suspicious in your question. Working until the next day is not unusual, something that the Europeans here don’t understand. It’s part of the Asian working culture. You are expected to work as long as your body can physical capable of. It will get better once you move into more senior position. Unfortunately, if you don’t obey you are not considered as employable. For your records, my Asian friends would frequently work until 3 or 4 am just before the deadline. Your situation is not as bad as you might think. The Singapore law allows you to say NO. You don’t have to work overtime if you really insist. But ... prepare for pressure, revenge and anger from your team as you're breaking the working culture and trust. It’s bad if you are the only one leaving home early when the whole team stay late. Again, working late is absolutely expected in Asia. Choose: 

You should first order your preferences. If they say no to full-time, is your next best option to take their part-time offer? or would you subsiquently not choose them at all? This could have a large impact on how you should present your request. Sounds like there are a number of questions about the internship like how many of their interns turn into full-time, which you might want to fill in by talking with them in more detail. You should figure out which questions you need to ask and what answers you need to hear to prefer it. If you would only choose them as full-time, there is no reason to beg or demand or bring in emotion in anyway. You can simply state in a matter of fact way that if the company was able to offer you a full-time position, it would be your top choice, but that you're primarially interested in full-time, so if they couldn't you will select one of your other full time offers. If you're going to choose them either way you can still request a full-time offer, but perhaps just tell them that the company is your first choice but that you're weighing it against other full-time offers and if they also offered full-time it would make your decision much easier. You should collect your thoughts about the questions you want to ask about the internship that would impact your decision, the answers you would want to hear, and the responses you would give in each situation, like my above example responses. Then take care of all of them in one phone call where you can get your answers as well as make the full-time request with the appropriate force. 

Transparent salaries means both the decision makers and the top earners will face more scrutiny. This creates an incentive to justify the salaries with more objective measures, which aren't necessarily better measures. One of the easiest default objective measures that will end up having a more weight in a transparent salaried company is years working for the company. Salaries will also likely become less extreme, and more people will get closer to the average. Any parts of performance that aren't objective will simply get less weight in the equation because they are hard to justify so make everyone uncomfortable. This means that exceptional and young employees working in fields where performance is mostly subjective will end up making less at a companies with transparent salaries, so they may just go elsewhere, but older worse employees will stick around. Even if the salary setters were stubborn and ignored their incentive to lean more towards easy to justify objective measures and paid everyone simply based on their best subjective measure of performance, it'll likely make the top performers uncomfortable making more than everyone else but not being able to objectively justify themselves either. You see this effect in Sweden where all tax returns are public and people make much closer to the median salary. 

You should immediately inform BOTH B and C about the situation. It might make you look good to B and they might rush. It shouldn't hurt you to tell C and they might give you the time you want. When you tell C just say you have another company you're waiting on another offer and its details in order to make the best decision and would like some additional time. I wouldn't tell them that you prefer B. Perhaps contact B first so you can see if you can get a sense of timing to provide to C. Many companies will be pretty accommodating (will rush or give you time at your request) for candidates with multiple offers because those are generally the best candidates. If it comes down to the wire and you only have an offer from C it is a personal decision and could burn some bridges depending on how you handle it. 

The best strategy is to use the money to buy some programming books. Make yourself work 7 days and the boss works 7 days as well. Do it yourself. 

We can't do this to experienced financial practitioners because they are competitive and highly employable. For your friend - Pay or never step into finance. 

Your experience is not unusual. Many people have had this experience, it's quite common. If you take note at the Kaggle prize winners, they would spend months just on improving error rate by something 2%. The non-winners could spend even more time on no improvement gain. If your existing model is already good, it's not simple to improve it even further. For example, deep learning might not improve the performance much if the data can be linearly separable. You're not alone. 

From the company perspective, you have nothing exciting to offer thus your salary should be lower than a new potential intelligent junior developer. You shouldn't be sad but take it as an opportunity. Now, you know there is someone in your team understand software development better than you. You can learn from the new developer and absorb the new skills into your your works. 

PhD hurts your job seeking. It's a shame to add it to a non-academic resume, so don't do that. You're not legally required to tell anybody about your PhD degree. Everybody does that. In the industry, nobody cares if you have a PhD title (they care if you have criminal records). It won't show up in background check because nobody cares. 

I don't see anything wrong. That's not your coworker's properties, everything belongs to the company. You're free to do whatever you want and exploit the company's assets to your advantage. Yes, don't need to ask, just do it. The management will be appreciated. You're not being rude, you're just doing your job. 

There's nothing to worry here. It might be your friend's only chance to get into the field. You might want to congratulate your friend for the job offer. It's a deal. Your friends buys a job. That's no free lunch, remember your friend has no relevant experience. Your friend is expected to pay to learn. It's just like buying a car, buying a house ... It's a business deal. Nothing suspicious here. Why the bankers receive so much money, and your friends can't (your friend has to pay!)? Want to blame? Blame for the incompetence. Your friend is not good enough, Simple. Read on. 

There's not much you can do. If you aren't allowed to internal transfer, then you don't have the power to do it. You could try to talk to the higher level, but that still wouldn't work if your manager refuses. Check if you have redundancy package (large companies in many countries need to do that). If you don't, I'd look for a new job if I were you. 

There's no conflict. You sign the upcoming contract. If you have a new offer from another company, you will sign it as well, and then terminate the first contract. If they don't let you do this, you make troubles on your first day for your first job, they will have no choice but to terminate you on the day. You might also get one week termination payment for your probation. Check your contract. Either you terminate your first job or you make them terminate you. Now, you can start your second job.
