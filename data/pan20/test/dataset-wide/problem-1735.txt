To change this, you have to have the application either bind on all local IP (0.0.0.0) or to a specific local IP (10.86.29.23) 

There is a known bug with task scheduler that will cause it to run the same task twice from time to time. It happens when the previous scheduled task terminates exactly when the new task is supposed to start: the scheduler will then run the same task twice. There is a hotfix available there: $URL$ When we ran into that problem, we fixed it simply by making the task run less frequently. 

When windows shuts down, you should have an event ID 1074 from the source "User32" listing what process and user initiated the shutdown, what type of shutdown is concerned (shutdown, restart, hibernate, etc). 

Without knowing exactly which version of windows you're using, nothing more can be said about your issue. As a habit, when you ask questions here, please specify what environment your using (OS, version, web server if it applies, framework version, etc.) 

The license allows you to run two VM on the same hardware without purchasing any other server license. However, in this case, you will not be allowed to run anything on the host OS (the one running on the hardware) than the hypervisor itself: you'll have to run AD, RDS and all other windows services in the VMs. 

It looks like this is part of a device driver for a Matrox graphic card. Assuming that the serer is using that brand of graphic card, you could try uninstalling the driver completely (reverting to VGA) and installing it again. 

That, however, will not be enough for mail to flow through: you also need some sort of DNS resolution. If that isn't already provided (for instance, by using the firewall as DNS server), you also will need to allow UDP and TCP connections to port 53 

Each web site (and potentially each web application) is IIS is linked to an application pool that holds configuration of the hosting process. Several of these properties are linked to how the process is recycled (terminated and restarted). By default, each application will be terminated every 1740 minutes (29 hours) but it can also be recycled if it's unused for (again, by default) 20 minutes, if it fails to answers to "ping" (actually, health monitoring beats). Other limits can be placed by the administrator. When the application is recycled, the container process is shut down. It has (by default) 90 seconds to shut down properly or it will be forcibly closed. So, the cause of your issue is that one of the recycling limits for your web app is reached, causing IIS to try to terminate it. Unfortunately, the application fails to shut down in time, causing that (temporary) error 500. Now, there is another aspect: if you application "fails" (i.e. sends back a server error) more than (by default) 5 times in a period of 5 minutes, it will be shut down by IIS and remain down until you manually restart it. All this points to an error in your application code. Talk to the supplier of that code and they will help you diagnose the exact issue. 

The only thing that worked was take the machine to a completely different network (an ethernet port on the WRT54GL wifi router that we use to connect customer to a dedicated ADSL line that has nothing to do with our internal network). I'm out of ideas here. There is something that changed in our internal configuration and not the whole network is having a fit when it is asked to handle that mac address. When I start a PING on the faulty machine and uses Wireshark on the destination, I see the same thing happening: when the ping on the machine fails, i see nothing in my trace. When the ping succeeds, I see the echo request coming in and the replies going out. The MAC address I see in the packets matches. I'm really out of ideas here about what is happening. Anyone cares to make a suggestion ? 

Have you check if these aren't just non-delivery notices sent in responses from spam that was sent to invalid internal email addresses ? 

You don't get the fingerprint from the private key file but from the public key file. In fact, ssh-keygen already told you this: 

WoW64 means "Windows on Windows 64". Basically, it's the 32-bits environment inside a windows 64 OS. Every win32 executable will be running "under" WoW64: there is no other way for the to run because they cannot use the 64bit version of the OS functions: they need to go through the translation layer provided by WoW64. 

This does yield the expected result: instead of getting all users who are directly or indirectly members of the group I'm searching for, I get all direct members of that group, plus a random selection of indirect members (members of groups that are member of the searched for group). The list I'm getting seems arbitrary: I can't find any difference in group membership between two users who should be present in the result set but one is there and the other isn't. (I need to solve this issue with LDAP search because the result will be used in an application, not through powershell. But using powershell in this way, I can reproduce the original problem in the way described). 

You have to specify which certificate you're going to use for each web site. You don't specify what version of IIS you're using so it's not possible to give you exact instructions but this can also be changed by script. You can, however, install the certificate in the server store only once and then select the same certificate for each web site. Remember, though, that you will need different IP or port for each of the domain that will accept SSL connections and that you will be unable to use host name mapping to distinguish between your webs. since you mention that you have only 6 names in your certificate (a Subject.CN and 5 ADN) that means that you'll be able to use that same certificate without error for only 6 webs. 

Normally, I'd create a scheduled task that runs the app and configure it to run as the local admin (or whatever account is necessary). In your case, however, i don't think that's your problem: the app simply isn't using the security context it's run from when trying to authenticate: that's why it's prompting you. 

No, Azure does not include an integrated backup system that allows you to rollback to a previous version. For the web site, the data is typically pretty small so it's pretty easy to SFTP or VPN into the web site and take a backup with a scheduled task. For the SQL database, the simplest option is to use the SQL import/export service to dump the content of the database to a storage blob. Since that import/export is not transitionally consistent, you will need to first make a database copy and take a backup of that copy. Other than that, there are a number of vendor who provide SQL azure backup services on premises or to cloud storage. 

First, are you sure you really need an interactive session ? Chances are you can actually run it inside a scheduled task if set it up property. Now, assuming the above is not possible/practical/allowed: You can setup your VM to automatically log in a user. The process is described here but here are the high points: 

It states that the data on the physical disk will be lost, not the data on the virtual disk. Now, I'd be nervous if I where in your situation as well so I'd give dell a call. be sure you get someone who actually understands what you're doing and what hardware you're running, though. 

Have you considered the possibility of someone simply hitting the power button ? That will cause exactly the behavior you described. 

You should have a feature named and another named To install the GUI shell from the powershell prompt, you can use: 

VPN stand for Virtual Private Network. It's a way to connect remote users and networks to an internal network in a safe way. It usually includes authentication as well as connection encryption. There are two main types of VPNs: site to site and remote access. Site to site is used to connect whole networks while remote access is typically used for, well, connecting remote users (i.e. single machines). So yes, VPN is the best way to got for what you want to do. In practice, what you should do is setup a VPN endpoint at the edge of your network (most firewalls have an option for this) or inside you DMZ (if you have a larger infrastructure) and have users connect to that VPN system. From there, you can setup what they can have access to and how. More sophisticated system also uses SSL connection for tunneling RDP or other remote control system. They work in a similar manner although the details will vary: users connect to a (usually web-based) external interface and then tunnel through that server to reach the internal machine. In all cases, you should setup the VPN endpoint directly on your production server but use an different machine for that. From there, it all depends on how secure you need your system to be. It's not uncommon to require users of higher-security systems to connect to an SSL VPN server, use it to connect to a "jump" server and then RDP from there to the final production machine. If you want specific examples of products that can help you set this kind of things up, I can give you some references of what I used. Edit: I know of 3 products that willl do what you specifically want well: Citrix Metaframe (expensive and suiited for large deployment, probably not what you're looking for), MS's own remoteApp system (not vers well suited to secure deployment and frankly probably too complex to setup for you need) and Sophos UMT. I suggest you use the last one: it's a specialized Linux firewall distro that includes all you need. There is a "free for home users" version that has all the features you need. For commercial use, however, you'll need to purchase a license. If you feel like investing more time into the project, you can also do is yourself using OpenVPN server on any Linux system for free. 

Assuming you really need the account to be member of the administrator group, then the proper way to implement this type of delegation of duty is to place the machine behind a separate firewall system and use a different set of credentials to manage that device. Another solution would be to use a regular user account and grant it the rights needed for doing whatever needs to be done. Unfortunately, it isn't always possible to implement either of these. In this case, I suggest that you describe the actual problem you want to solve (instead of the issue you're having with a solution you already chose) and see if someone can offer some advise. 

I'm working on a set of script that will be used to migrate the users and structure from one active directory to another. For this, I'm using the Get-ADOrganizationalUnit commandlet to export the OUs like this: 

Simply put: yes, it can. It's not as straightforward as that, though: you'll need to configure the environment before you can really use it, but it's not that complex. The simplest, really, is to get an Amazon WS account and try it for yourself: it'll cost a couple of dollars at most. 

While @iain's answer is perfectly correct, assuming your client is a windows system I would suggest you use fiddler for this instead. tcpdump/tshark/wireshark is a great tool for general network sniffing but fiddler is specifically designed for debugging http(s). 

If that explanation is not sufficient, could you please clarify exactly what you want to protect by SSL encapsulation ? 

A little more complex: install URL rewrite for IIS and configure it to forward all HTTP request to the equvalent HTTPS request. Watch it because you might need to rewrite the host name as well (see this for a simple exemple) 

So, assuming you type in "nslookup 1.2.3.4", you will generate a DNS query for "4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.". This request will then be processed by one of the DNS servers of all the following domains: 

Once all of this has been done, enable the WAF and it should work. If it doesn't, then start by creating a new firewall profile, select the "monitor" mode and leave everything unchecked: that's the most permissive firewall rule possible and test again. If that doesn't fix it, the review the logs on your web server: did it receive the requests ? Did it reply to them with a valid response code ? Etc. If all else fail, please describe your setup in detail, including what application you're running on the web server (because some simply do not work with Sophos WAF, like OWA or Citrix web interface)
