That is why, Frege's analysis of a sentence like "the concept horse is a concept", is the following: 

The very form of it suggests its counterexample: take any proposition p that has happened in the past and will never happen again (e.g. "Julius Caesar is being stabbed"). That means that P(p) is true. Therefore P(p) ∨ p ∨ F(p) is true. But it's not the case that Caesar will be stabbed again, so F(p) is false.                                                                    References van Benthem, J.

The shape of the conclusion suggests that we attempt to prove this directly: by assuming the antecedent (P ∨ S) and trying to derive the consequent (Q). So assume (P ∨ S). Now we proceed by cases: assume P and get some conclusion X, assume S and get that same conclusion X, and conclude that X. 

I agree that to define metaphysics as the study of the "nature of reality" is completely inadequate. It is a shallow definition, misleading, arguably circular. You leave us with a very complicated mission, though, if you expect the answer to this question to be given in pragmatic ("black and white") terms. The first thing that comes to my mind is that the answer would have to be like a confusion-killing bullet, a short, almost poetic formula. Fearless as I feel today of the occasional downvote, I'll give it a shot. 

The thing is, one doesn't need to assume that these are different levels of abstraction, that are intrinsic to the thing being observed. As it happens, my nervous system is a computational machine, but in the same right it can be identified as a biological machine, a chemical machine, or a physical machine (in the specific sense of being describable using only concepts from the physical science). These different levels of observation belong to the mind that does the observation, not to the thing. Now, the crucial observation, one that Brian Cantwell Smith makes here, is that because there are machines that do computational things - possibly quite intelligent ones - the fact that these machines were created by humans does not entail that the final cause of those artifacts is known to those humans, or even controlled by them in any objective way. That's why you can say, quite confidently, that identification involves at least a choice of perspective. It is thus, at least primarily, in the eye of the beholder. 

simply means that there are moments when the agent is sad, but it also seems to imply (in the literature they call this implicature) that there are times when she is not sad. To show that this is an implicature and not an implication, we can provide the following defeater: 

Here's one way of analyzing it. Consider the predicate 'Thinks(α, φ)', which is true just in case agent α thinks that φ is true. Let A be the Archivist, and A Sonmi 541. Let's begin by looking at what A says: 

Proof. We prove by contraposition. Assume that F = (W, R) is not reflexive, with the goal of showing that (φ → ♢φ) is not valid on F. To show that (φ → ♢φ) is not valid on F it will suffice to present a counter-model M = (F, V) based on F where for some w &in; W, (M, w) |= φ ∧ ¬♢φ. Consider M = (W, R, V), where W = {w}, R is irreflexive and V(p) = W. Informally, we have a single node called 'w' with the label 'p' meaning that proposition p is true at world w; we have no other worlds. Now, since p is true at w, we have (M, w) |= p. But since there are no other worlds and (by irreflexivity of R) w cannot access itself, (M, w) |= ♢p is false. That means that we have a pointed world (M, w) s.t. (M, w) |= p ∧ ¬♢p. That means that (φ → ♢φ) cannot be valid on frame F.                                                                                 ■ 

I'll post a very unpretentious answer, just to get the ball rolling here. It seems to me that there is an extremely interesting question hidden behind this one, a question that is very difficult to formulate, but that I believe can be formulated - if enough context is added, so that it becomes expressible. It wouldn't be a question that begins with doubt, for a simple reason. The common problem with all these exercises of doubt, is that there has to be some kind of self to do the doubting - even if there is no need for a subject to do the "willing". My reply to your second question is that if action (or will to act) required subjectivity, that would be a strong statement in favor of the conception of body and soul as distinguishable things. Not something to take lightly. On the other hand, if action (or will) does not require a subjective stance, what to make of responsibility (my way of phrasing your third question)? It can be argued that there is responsibility (and thus a self that is not empty or inconsequent) in how reality is reunited in concept ("bundled", if you will), and interpreted. There may be responsibility in judging what happened, and then taking a stand. Even if there wasn't anybody there at first, there will necessarily be someone right after the action took place, precisely as a (partial) result of the action that took place, able to contemplate where it came from, and own it. Some say that the ethics of psychoanalysis, according to Lacan, is derived from this assumption. What buddhists have to contribute to the problem of consciousness as illusion is a practice of abandonment. Not exactly a thesis, mostly a path. So that would be one important difference between these two approaches, in my view, and my (indirect) answer to your first question. 

The first is a physical principle and it does seem to be true of our universe, so we may go ahead and call it "natural". The second is a logical principle, which, having nothing to do with our universe is trivially going to be true of it. (2) may be applied to states of affairs in our universe, but that simply means that (2) has an application in the real world, not that it is about the natural world (not uncontroversial; cf. Pincock's The Applicability of Mathematics). Their difference, following Carnap, I would characterize as follows. 

Example. PA says that [insert Peano Axioms here]. Therefore: addition on N is commutative. As you can see, the step where you express your "trust" in the axioms is missing, because it's not needed. Whatever anyone may think of the axioms, this argument is valid. Well, I left out the details and qualifications. PA doesn't say that addition is commutative in the sense that it's not among its axioms; but the commutativity of addition follows from the axioms of PA in a sense which can be made very precise. You may have all sorts of reasons to like or dislike PA, but the argument from PA to P when P is a logical consequence of PA doesn't depend on your preferences. I think the same applies to all arguments from axioms: they don't depend on anyone's belief about the truth of the axioms. In fact, some of the greats like Hilbert, Carnap, and Curry, have (at least once in their writings) entertained the thought that axioms should simply be treated as meaningless sequences of symbols, which can be manipulated to yield other meaningless sequences of symbols by basic combinatorial processes. (If interested in these things, check out Alan Weir's SEP Formalism article). 

In this account, qualities of things do not stand on their own, and are also not memories of sensations, but are those elements of reality that can be traced back to sensations, but only as they are abstracted from them, and then rearranged in units of existence that we synthetically call objects of the world, thanks to the presence of signs of reality, which are paradoxically those that cannot be seen, or remembered, by themselves. Interestingly, it is exactly because they are not directly based on sensations that experiences can endure. It is because we have an involuntary (and largely unconscious) theory of reality that we can add coherence to our sensations. 

That would be my formula. You might say that this would be a futile endeavor, that to ask "what is...?" questions is as trivial as orange juice, and needs no justification, but I would have to disagree with you on that precise point. You may not believe me, but there was a time when the verb to be, with the meaning that it has today, didn't exist. It is possible to think without it, and without asking "what is...?" questions. At some point, to be became a part of some (not all) human languages. The ancient Greeks tried to understand what it means in a purposeful and systematic way, and the rest is the history of metaphysics. 

This is an important question and you make a number of points worth thinking about more deeply. I offer the following not as an answer, but as a formal prelude to more worthy answers. We start with relations:                                                 §1. n-ary Relations as Sets of n-tuples According to the standard set-theoretic account of relations, an n-ary relation R is nothing more or less than a set SR consisting of n-tuples of elements from n underlying domains. Some examples: 

Example. Let's see whether the formula (p ∧ q) is metaphysically possible. It is iff ◇(p ∧ q) is valid with respect to Carnapian models. Since there are two propositional letters in that formula, viz. 'p', and 'q', there are 22 = 4 possible valuations: v1 = {(p, &bot;), (q, &bot;)}, v2 = {(p, &bot;), (q, &top;)}, v3 = {(p, &top;), (q, &bot;)}, v4 = {(p, &top;), (q, &top;)}. Now, ◇(p ∧ q) will be valid just in case there is at least one valuation among those four s.t. p ≡ q ≡ &top;. Is there such a valuation? Yes, v4. Therefore, we know that (p ∧ q) is metaphysically possible. Now, if we want to explicate the notions of physical, biological, epistemic, and so on, modalities, we have to somehow restrict these Carnapian models. Thankfully that has already been done by Kripke, who introduced the notion of relative modalities (in Carnapian models, modalities are absolute in that we evaluate them with respect to all models). The propositional language we defined above (Definition 1) we'll now interpret in Kripke models with the hope of defining non-metaphysical modalities. 

Keep in mind that genes are causally related to phenomena occurring in many levels at the same time: molecular, cellular, systemic, individual, social, even environmental. The interplay of all these different levels is not without attrition. More often than not, the existence of a particular trait cannot be reduced to a single explanatory principle. Your premise - that there's nothing to be gained from positive affections on the individual level - is probably unwarranted in itself, but also suffers from a limitation in perspective, as the best utilitarian explanations for the existence of emotions are probably those that investigate the phenomenon at the social level. 

To discuss the honesty of the doubt - which is not to argue directly against the doubter as a person, but to require (in abstract) the doubt to be genuine, i. e., not just plausible, but actually existing as an affection. That stance is present in some arguments against cartesianism, for instance, and can be applied to the present case. To argue that even in the absence of certainty, action is still inevitable, and so is responsibility. The refusal to take action based on lack of certainty is unjustifiable, in the same way breaking the law can't be justified by ignorance. As a consequence, doubt is not enough of a reason to proclaim "business as usual"; this attitude must have grounds of its own, and the evidence to support them. 

Based on these observations, we can present a counterexample to the equivalence of (1) & (2) by having a world where some agent α knows P, but some other agent β does not know P. This situation would show that P is known (by someone), but nevertheless not epistemically necessary (because at least one agent, viz. β, doesn't know P). 

This says that John is a son of Mary and every person x who is a son of Mary is John, which is the intended meaning of (5) I assume. Following the second approach we get: 

I will shamelessly use the opportunity to talk about the distinction between unrestricted vs bounded quantifiers. I suspect our intuitions favor one or the other in different contexts, causing the confusion. When quantifiers are introduced in logic courses they're usually unrestricted, which means that the x in ∀x and ∃x ranges over the entirety of the domain of discourse. An alternative is to have bounded quantifiers ∀x &in; A and ∃x &in; A for every subset A of the domain of discourse. The confusion might be arising because the universal quantifier in "all dogs are animals" is implicitly taken to be a bounded one:
