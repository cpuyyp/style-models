Guiding: For DSO, you'll do very long exposures. The mount alone is not precise enough. You need to guide it. This is done by using a smaller telescope (guidescope) installed on the main telescope, using a small camera (guide camera). The finderscope that's normally used for visual astronomy could be used as a guidescope. If you have a DSO camera and a planetary camera, you could use the planetary camera as a guide camera for DSO photography. You'll have to connect the camera to a software that can control the mount and issue corrections to it. The most popular app is PHD2 a.k.a. Open PHD. When doing DSO imaging, you'll spend most time during your first year basically learning all the subtle aspects of guided exposures. 

A few observations. It's really the larger aperture of the instrument that is the problem here. The pupil of your eye is only a few mm in diameter. The objective lens or mirror of a telescope could be anywhere between dozens of mm to hundreds of mm (or thousands for very large instruments). The ratio of areas between telescope aperture and eye pupil is even greater - it's the square of the ratio of diameters. Let's say your eye's pupil is 2 mm in diameter. Let's say you use a 50 mm aperture telescope (small refractor or binoculars). The diameter ratio is 25x. The area ratio is 625x. All the light captured by the very large area of the instrument is funneled into your eye through your pupil. With the instrument, now you're getting 625x more energy from the Sun, compared to the naked eye view. It's already dangerous to look at the Sun with the naked eye - with the instrument it's 625x more dangerous. And this is with a very small refractor. There is a class of "solar filters" that are made to be mounted on the instrument's eyepiece, or after the eyepiece. THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS! All the increased, focused energy of the Sun is now absorbed by the filter, which can warp, melt, crack, or burst into flames. A filter failure at this point is likely to injure the user. White light filtering for solar observations must always occur ahead of the instrument, not after it. 

It should be noted that the Milky Way is not visible during the winter months (December – February). It's best to try to watch it in June – August. Even later in the year (September – November) it's still visible in the West, just before it sets, a short time after nightfall. If you're an early riser, you can see it before daybreak in the spring (March – May). You need to wait until the sky goes completely dark after sunset. That means 1.5 hours after sunset, or more. To determine the precise moment of sunset, go on Google or Wolfram Alpha and search for "sunset today". Then add 90 minutes to the result. You will also need to time your visit to a night when the Moon is not visible. The Moon must be below horizon, otherwise it would cause some "light pollution" of its own. A few days before and after the new moon are the best time for this. You could go on Wolfram Alpha and search for "next new moon" or even "new moon in september" and it will give you the date. Several days plus or minus that date should be fine. $URL$ 

The Sun is the same as ever. It's just that people tend to stare at it for long times during the eclipse. A quick glance doesn't do much damage, but prolonged staring could be bad. Those who see the phase of totality have an additional risk. After the Sun goes completely dark, and it then finally shows up again, some people feel compelled to keep watching that tiny sliver of light without protection for a long time. Don't. When the actual surface of the Sun is visible again after totality is over, it's time to put the googles back on. Do not use regular sunglasses. They typically don't block the kinds of radiation they should block to allow you to watch the event safely. There are several options here: Very dark welding glasses. Ask a welder or go to a welding shop. They have these special glasses to protect themselves from the radiation from the welding arc, which is similar to the Sun's radiation. These glasses are numbered to show how dark they are. For viewing the Sun, use the darkest ones, labeled #14. A welding mask with a #14 glass is perfectly safe no matter how long you're looking at the Sun. #13 glass might be safe too for short durations, but it's not recommended. Anything lower than that is not safe. Goggles made specifically for watching the Sun. There are many kinds of them. As long as they pass the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard they're fine. I recommend the goggles made of Baader solar film. They show the Sun in its original color (not red, green, orange, etc). There are several kinds here, too; the Baader AstroSolar Silver/Gold Film passes the ISO standard, these are what I use. You can buy them online in various places and they're very cheap.

No, it has not. Modern instruments are getting closer to the theoretical limits of the observable universe. In other words, we are getting so good at astronomy, now we can see almost as far away as theoretically possible. That doesn't mean we're seeing "the edge of the universe". It only means we're seeing as far as the laws of nature allow us to see. 

The entire discussion above was about "filled aperture" telescopes: given a round shape of a certain diameter, it is filled with mirror segments. For a given aperture, this design captures the largest amount of light. But the aperture does not have to be filled. It can be mostly empty. You could have a few reflecting segments on the periphery, and the center would be mostly void. You'd have the same resolving power (you would see the same small details), it's just that the brightness of the image would decrease, because you're capturing less light total. This is the principle of the interferometer. The twin 10 meter segmented Keck mirrors in Hawaii can work as an interferometer with a baseline of 85 meters. This is effectively equivalent to a single 85 meter aperture in terms of resolving power, but obviously not in terms of image brightness (amount of light captured). The US Navy has an interferometer in Arizona with mirrors placed on 3 arms in a Y shape, each arm 250 meters long. That gives the instrument a baseline (equivalent aperture) of several hundreds of meters. U of Sydney has a 640 meter baseline interferometer in the Australian desert. Interferometers cannot be used to study very faint objects, because they can't capture enough light. But they can produce very high resolution data from bright objects - e.g. they are used to measure the diameter of stars, such as Betelgeuse. The baseline of an interferometer can be made extremely large. For terrestrial instruments, a kilometers-wide baseline is very doable now. Larger will be doable in the future. There are talks about building interferometers in outer space, in orbit around Earth or even bigger. That would provide a baseline at least in the thousands of kilometers. That's not doable now, but seems feasible in the future. 

Since light is reflected from mirrors at angles different from normal, you cannot use the traditional symmetric shapes such as parabolic, spherical, etc. You need to basically take a paraboloid and squish it in one direction so that it works about the same like a parabolic mirror (I'm simplifying), but at an angle of reflection of, say, 45 degrees. In such an instrument you could have multiple "potato chip" mirrors, as in the diagram above. You have to design the instrument as a whole; computer simulations will adjust the shape of each mirror until the performance of the whole instrument is close to a classic straight design. As far as I can tell, the manufacturing precision is such that freeform optics are only usable at long wavelengths such as infrared, where less precise optics can be used. But technology improves all the time. It also depends on how much aberration you can tolerate in your image. For usage from ground level this is less useful, unless you absolutely need a telescope in a very small form factor for some reason. Classic optics are still preferred when space and shape are not restricted. 

I make my own mirrors and telescopes. The method recommended by Gary Seronik, that you linked above, is very good, and it's widely used. A few comments: Don't be afraid to touch the mirror with clean paper. The vast majority of mirrors these days are over-coated with SiO(x) and are quite sturdy. Maybe wash the mirror before you do anything else, this way you'll remove potentially abrasive dust particles. This is how: $URL$ - it's a good idea to wash the mirror anyway, like once a year or every other year. When making the big paper template, cut the disk from a piece of paper without wrinkles. Draw a good circle, and cut it carefully. Make sure it's flat and it doesn't want to roll up. When centering it, go over the edge again and again, and adjust it so that it's perfectly centered. You center it by working out the edge alignment with the mirror. Take all the time you need. You could also cut the template out of transparent plastic, larger than the mirror, and just draw a circle on it, the same size like the mirror. This method is recommended by Jim Fly (of Catseye) even for quite large mirrors. Both versions (paper or plastic) work about the same IMO. It may take a bit of trial and error to put the central dot on the mirror without smearing it. The marker tends to smear up underneath the paper. Practice on a random piece of glass or polished metal. The reason why Bob Fies (of Alcoat) says it's not for lasers is that, the way he shows it, the paper dot is solid. Of course it wouldn't work with a bare laser - you need a donut shape, with a hollow center, to allow the laser to reflect (when using a bare laser, not with a tuBlug). Just use a little donut instead of a solid paper dot, for the final step - like Gary shows on his website. If you never use a bare laser to adjust the primary, a solid dot is fine. But a donut gives you more options. I've done business with Bob directly, he's very experienced. Like Gary Seronik and Jim Fly, he should be considered an expert in this field. But take his advice in context and look at all the details - he says what he says for a good reason.

Nothing can escape from within the event horizon. It is possible to escape from within the ergosphere if you rotate with the black hole - this is known as the Penrose process. I was not able to find visualisations of a Kerr (rotating) black hole, but it should look somewhat similar to a non-rotating one, except it would appear "flattened" at the poles, and bulging at the equator. 

Larger telescopes (around 6" ... 8" and larger) should use active ventilation for better cooling (a fan on the back of the mirror). More details here: Gary Seronik: Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 1 Gary Seronik: Beat the Heat: Conquering Newtonian Reflector Thermals — Part 2 In your case, simple passive cooling for 1 hour should be enough, but it's worth reading those articles. Focal ratio A 3" scope, at 300mm focal length, that's an f/4 instrument. That's a pretty steep f/ ratio. Most eyepieces will not do well with such a blunt cone of light, and will start to exhibit aberrations that blur the image. Only very expensive eyepieces work well at such low focal ratios - things like TeleVue Ethos, or Explore Scientific 82 degree eyepieces. Try and keep the planet in the center - most aberrations are lower there. Even very simple eyepieces do better in the middle of the image. Look at the stars. Are they tiny and round in the center, and large and fuzzy at the edge? Those are aberrations from various sources (eyepiece, primary mirror, etc). Coma Of course, at f/4 even the best eyepieces out there cannot do anything about coma - an aberration coming out of any parabolic mirror, which becomes pretty obvious around f/5, very obvious at f/4, and a major problem at f/3. Again, coma is zero in the center of the image, and increases towards the edge.
