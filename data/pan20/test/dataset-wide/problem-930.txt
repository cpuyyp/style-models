Solar wind particles directly entering the Earth's magnetosphere are not responsible for the majority of bright auroral displays. As you have found, it is magnetic reconnection that accelerates magnetospheric plasma that collides with the upper atmosphere to cause the visible aurora. Polar rain The Solar wind does enter the magnetosphere directly, and travels down the field lines that have their feet poleward of the main auroral oval. This is termed the polar rain¹. The particles in the polar rain are usually too low energy and low intensity to provide visible aurora, though they do produce X-rays as the particles accelerate in the atmosphere (for example, in this report of a Nasa study). On occasion, the polar rain can become energetic and intense enough to generate visible emissions, unsurprisingly termed 'polar rain aurora'². Magnetic reconnection Magnetic reconnection is responsible for the displays that people usually think of as the Northern Lights. The brightest aurorae typically occur on the auroral oval around midnight Magnetic Local Time (MLT). This can be seen in the results of the current OVATION model below.

The energetic electrons that cause the bright midnight aurora are generated by reconnection in the magnetotail, the portion of the Earth's magnetosphere that streams behind the Earth, dragged by the motion of the Solar wind (this is briefly mentioned in the NASA youtube videos linked in the question). We can tell this from the fact that the aurorae occur in a distinct oval around the pole. The bright aurorae occur near the open-closed field line boundary³, toward the closed side of the boundary. Closed field lines are those that have one foot in the northern hemisphere, follow a continuous closed path through the magnetosphere and have a second (conjugate) foot in the southern hemisphere. This means that any charged particles on these field lines must originate from within the Earth's magnetosphere. Conversely, the field lines accessible to charged particles from the Solar wind are the open field lines; it is along these field lines that polar rain occurs. These occur closer to the pole than the closed field lines, and form the dark area around the pole where the aurorae are not usually observed. The field lines are 'open' in the sense that they connect to the interplanetary magnetic field and are connected to the Earth at only one end, the other being open to the Solar wind. An historical footnote The idea that magnetic reconnection is the main cause of the aurorae is not a new one. I am not sure when magnetospheric sources of energetic particles, and reconnection specifically, became the dominant theory of the aurorae, but it was certainly before Dungey⁴ described the magnetospheric convection pattern in 1961. So, why is this news in the 2010s? I would suggest that it is a case where an earlier, simpler explanation has become lodged in the public consciousness long after it has passed from being the state-of-the-art. Around the turn of the 20th century, the earliest investigations into the aurorae involved physical models of the magnetosphere and the Solar wind. These terrellas suggested that Solar wind directly caused the aurorae, but left investigators such as Kristian Birkeland unable to explain why the real aurorae did not occur over the pole itself, as the terrella model suggested they should. 

On the composition of the crust... The most incompatible elements in the mantle (e.g. lithophile elements [K,Na, Nd] and high field strength elements [U,Th]) will go into the liquid melt and move towards the surface of the Earth and either erupt on the surface or be stored in a magma chamber and further fractionate or differentiate to more felsic magma compositions. Through time, all of these processes will generate different pieces of crust formed from different sources and at varying conditions and later become altered due to either chemical or physical metamorphism. Each of the continents we have today are pieced together from the separation and collision of other tectonic plates. For example, Pangaea was formed due to the collision of many different plates, I am not sure if Pangaea was then considered one giant plate, but it then broke apart and separated. 

The answer to this is has roots in another question you asked about the differences between continental crust and oceanic crust. Carlson et al. (2014) just put out an excellent review of what we know about Earth and how it formed through time. I am using it as a guide and source for much of this post. Just recently an age of a zircon was determined to be 4.374 Ga (Valley et al., 2014) using U-Pb geochronology. The age of the Earth is 4.54 ± 0.05 Ga. This new result suggests that granitic and felsic magma was already present on Earth only after ~160 million years after the Earth formed. Some other interesting dates is the Moon formation between 4.4 to 4.45 Ga and, based on xenon isotopes, the separation of the atmosphere from the solid Earth is thought to happen around 4.45 Ga. After the formation of the Earth, the core formed, thereby creating a metallic inner core and the primitive outer mantle. The Earth began to cool and differentiate and thereby form a crust. Different models suggest a range of possibilities such as a quasi-stable quench crust of peridotitic/komatiitic composition (Smith, J.V., 1981) to a very evolved composition approaching tonalite (Harrison,T.A., 2009). The question now is this crust now a plate or rather, similar to the lithosphere as we know it today? The lithosphere is defined as the brittle outer layer of the Earth and plates are segments of the lithosphere and the base of it is called the Mohorovičić discontinuity, which generally defines the contact between the lithosphere and the upper mantle. It is interesting to think about when these features may have formed as the Earth's outer crust is forming. There is an entire GSA Special Paper volume on the subject of 'When Did Plate Tectonics Begin on Planet Earth?'. There is a range of evidence suggesting that plate tectonics as we know it today initiated at the latest around ~3 Ga to as late as ~1 Ga (Condie & Kröner, 2008). Below is a table from that paper that outlines indicators of plate tectonics. 

The East African Rift is currently a divergent boundary within the African Plate. So the answer is yes. 

The outer crust of Earth is likely not stationary, but possibly being dragged along the paths of mantle convection. These brittle segments begins colliding into one another and building upwards while other portions are subducted beneath other plate segments. The convecting mantle causes mantle material to be brought up from depth to conditions at lower pressures, which cause the mantle to melt (this is called adiabatic melting). There was a paper just recently published in Nature by Bercovici and Ricard(2014) where they try to answer the question as to why we see geological evidence of proto-subduction at 4 Ga with for prominent subduction features appearing around 3 Ga. I suggest reading the abstract on the papers website but they suggest that ... 

"Rare earth" metals consist of Scandium, Yttrium, and 15 other metals of the so-called "Lanthanide" series toward the bottom of the Periodic Table of elements. Basically, these are the chemicals that we didn't study in chemistry class at school. Like other metals, they have two electrons in the outer shell, but unlike "metallic" chemicals such as sodium or magnesium, they have a special "metal" shell for electrons. They are located at the "left" (relative to the carbon family) or akaline end of the Periodic Table, which is why they are found near alkaline magnatism, in alkaline "compounds." This is in contrast to the more common chemicals, which are typically found as "oxides," or "sulfides," or possibly in combination with fluorine or chlorine. These common chemical compounds are on the right, or acid side of the periodic table. 

There are several factors that determine the spectrum of wave frequencies of earthquakes. They include the following: 1) Size of the earthquake. All other things being equal, the larger the earthquake, the larger the spectrum of frequencies. 2) The texture of the rocks or other materials. Hard materials have a wider range of frequencies than soft materials. 3) The ratio of "body" to surface waves. Waves emanating from the body of the earthquake have higher total frequencies (and greater variation), than waves emanating from the surface of the ground. 

The Pacific Rim is pretty much defined by the so-called "Ring of Fire." It consists of the "stomping ground" for a disproportionate number of earthquakes and volcanoes, and the affected territory extends up and down the coast of North and South America, up and down the East Asian coast, and into the "Australasian" islands like Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Zealand. Apparently it has something to do with the presence (or absence) of tectonic plates there. Why is there such a configuration of tectonic plates, and the resulting earthquakes and volcanoes in the Pacific, and not to the other oceans? 

The currents run counterclockwise. That's why the Humboldt Current cools the Pacific coast of South America, because the water is coming from the "six o'clock" position in the Antarctica. But in the Northern Hemisphere, the "six o'clock" position is warm water near the equator, which warms Oregon and Washington. In the northern hemisphere, the cold Labrador current cools land to its west. That's because the water is coming from the "12 o'clock position near the Arctic. On the other hand, the west coast benefits from warm water currents running in a counterclockwise direction. That's because the "6 'oclock" position in the northern hemisphere is near the tropics, which brings warm water to Washington and Oregon at the "2-3 o'clock" position. All other things being equal, colder air carries less moisture than warm air, and land near cold water currents is dryer than land near warm water currents. 

Yes.Thermohaline circulation is dependent on differences in water density, caused by differences in temperature and salinity between different bodies of water. It therefore requires deepwater areas, of which the northern and middle Atlantic have the most, for these differences or "gradients" to form. These are influences on the Gulf Stream. In addition, the Gulf Stream is wind driven, as is true of most currents. So it depends on both influences. 

Robert Mallet is sometimes referred to as the "father of seismology." He was helped (around 1850) by the newly created science of photography, which enabled him to create seismic "maps" of the earth, at different depths. He has started life as an iron engineer/manufacturer, but turned his talents to seismology after a number of devastating earthquakes in Europe. His earlier work with iron gave him a background in the use of explosives to "open up" the earth at critical points. Paleoseismology is a related field that relies on paleontology to form estimates of various properties of the earth.
