I recently picked up another well loved GT road bike frame- it's in great shape aside from a missing downtube cable stop. The model is a ZR 4000 probably from 1999, it's 7005 heat treated aluminum. My best guess is that the cable stop was originally glued or bonded to the frame somehow based on a lack TIG weld lines or braze. I'm not sure if the cable stop snapped off from poor storage or when the frame was in use last. It's a CL find and lived in a garage for a number of years. 

Then you could walk to the craft aisle, pick out a roll of felt and a box of velcro tie downs, glue it all in place and be ready to roll! I have a small front rack that'd fit that tackle box pictured, and you could easily fit it on a decent sized rear rack. If you leave your 22oz hammer at home, this setup would be within the weight range of very affordably priced bike racks. My secret weapon in not losing small things like washers is a bag of a million baggies: 

I have a little, red toolbox with sliding drawers. Each drawer has a felt liner so things don't get scratched or make loud noises. If I needed to carry it around everywhere, I'd take a pair of scissors and cut two, small slits in the liner for each tool. I'd then feed a loop of velcro through the slit so each tool could be fastened down. This would keep everything where you left it and it'd keep some of the more precision machined tools from getting dinged up. I'd forego carrying around things like hammers and screw drivers since everyone has them and they weigh a lot more than bike-specific tools. Since you need small and light, I recommend a plastic fishing tackle box available at all the big box stores. Often the plastic dividers can be moved around to fit whatever you need. 

RaceFace makes cinch spindles in various lengths. I assume you have a version for 68/73mm bottom brackets. There's also a 100mm bottom bracket spindle option. It will certainly fit, but Q-factor might become too wide for your liking. Theoretically, you can also order a custom length spindle and spacers from some CNC manufacturer. 

As you can see, there's a lot of variables involved, a list of current parts would simplify the answer a great deal. 

The frame seems suspicious: it clearly was TIG-welded, just look at those smooth tube joints and compare to 80s lugged frames, which means the MY should be at least in mid 90s. The Dyna looks very similar, but the the dropouts don't match (holes vs no holes). Newer frames either have seatpost bolt inline with top tube or a modern collar, but the frame in question has the bolt at least a centimeter higher than the top of the top tube. The paint doesn't match the time period either, the most similar paint jobs date to 80s lugged frames, just like the head badge. I think it was repainted with the use of an aftermarket decals set. I'd look for any branding cues in every crook and nanny and ask the previous owner about the model and paint job. 

Any half-decent fork requires maintenance, the air variety of XCR not being an exception. True, Suntour does not seem to publish XCR-specific docs compared to other higher priced forks like Auron or Axon, but there's a general fork manual available. Some relevant quotes from it: 

It would still be helpful if you posted a photo, but I think I can answer without it! The first major dimension of a bottom bracket is its width. If you have a metric ruler or tape, simply place it underneath the bottom bracket shell. There aren't a bunch of standards super close together so you'll easily get this one right. 68mm is really common and would make your project very easy to complete, but it's ok if it's different. Like @Criggie said, the 1.37x24T measures the threading. Threads are the next most important dimension, and yours is standard English which is very easy to replace. Like I said in a comment, your old spindle was probably asymmetrical, but new ones are typically symmetrical. To get your correct spindle length, you need to measure from the center of your spindle to the outer edge of the drive (or right) side. Double that number and you'll have the correct new spindle size. You'll probably want a pair of calipers for this, but the $5 ones at the hardware store are more than sufficient. I did a quick google and your bottom bracket is probably a Sugino. All I did was type in "SCM 3UB bottom bracket" to get there. This is a Japanese part that is likely NJS spec'd (criteria for use in Japanese track racing) so it very well could have an ISO taper and not a JIS. See here from Sheldon to understand these terms. If your measurements are perfect and your crank won't slide on to the right place, this is the next culprit. If this BB is ISO, and your replacement BB was NJS, then your crank arm was probably about 4mm off from where it needed to be. Did you already get the fixed cup out of the bottom bracket shell? If you didn't, I'd just take it to the LBS for help. They can do all of these measurements (including checking to see if it's NJS or ISO) for you, and that way you only buy one bottom bracket- the one that fits. Good luck! 

I'd advise to contact the venue you bought the bike from and even SR Suntour itself for further details. 

Obviously, an 11-speed cassette is required. For a road bike: you should check if your freehub body has a spacer, if it does then the hub can accept any Shimano/SRAM 11 speed cassette. If there's no spacer, you can get a Shimano CS-HG800 (works with narrow freehub bodies). If freehub is Campy-spec, then any Campy 11-speed cassette will fit. Another option is to source a wider, aftermarket freehub body if such an option is available. For MTB: get any 11-speed cassette compatible with your freehub (which is most likely a regular Shimano HG). You will need 11-speed shifter(s), compatible with your new RD. A cheaper solution might be to get a friction shifter or only a rear shifter and leave the old front shifter as is. You did not say what RD you already have, but I hope it's a not an MTB-specific one, otherwise you'd have "fun" looking for a compatible shifter option (there are some). Any 11 speed chain. Make sure your new RD can clear the biggest cog on the new cassette. Usually, this info can be found in product manual. Make sure the RD can handle the chain growth capacity. I'm not sure road 11 speed system work with a triple up front, you did not specify what the current groupset is. 

Yes, you can, but a 2mm spacer might be need. 10 speed Shimano MTB cassettes require same freehub body width as 11 speed. Meanwhile, Shimano road-specific cassettes are ~2mm wider. To be sure, I'd measure freehub body width (36.75 on that pic). If it's about 37mm, that means rear hub can accomodate wider 11 speed road cassettes and you will need a spacer for sure. Otherwise, you can put a 10 speed cassette as is. On a side note, Novatec (Joytech) produces a wide variety of hubs, same models can have both XD, 10 and 11 freehub body options. 

I can't imagine a backpack being a good place for tools in the long run. The lack of structure would drive me bonkers- it'd be so easy to keep losing those little bits in all the cloth folds and seams. If you wanted to go this route, I'd look into bags aimed at photographers since they come with lots of little, structured pockets. This is probably the most expensive route too since it's a "specialty" product. 

I picked up this very cool 96-97 GT rage from Craigslist with the intention of restoration- a few rusty pinch bolts, spider eggs in the brake hoods, grinding bearings and pitted races, and all the good stuff that comes to a bike living outside for 5 years. I was excited to get my first aluminum frame for the project as I knew it wouldn't be rusted like steel would have. (It spent a lot of time in the rain.) It wasn't for another day until I found hairline cracks forming under the seat post clamp and around the GT rear stamp. I suspect the clamp was over tightened at one point, but it was very normal when I got to it and the little slit cut into the back of the tube isn't squished or malformed which I've seen happen on steel frames that were over tightened. How long will the frame actually last? It's a GT so it's got the triple triangle so I'm not worried about my seat stays coming loose or my seat post falling into the tube. Should I be? I know fatigue cracks in some places means it's time to trash the frame, but I'm not a pro racer and I ride pretty lightly. I'm interested in other people's experiences with aging aluminim and possibly hearing thoughts aside from putting it on the curb for trash day. I can feel the cracks with my fingernail but they're too small to actually fit my nail inside. I've read 7005 aluminim cannot be repaired since it requires heat treatment. I love this bike because I love 90s and GT (and its so hard to find tall frames that aren't 70s gas pipe builds) but I'm not sure it's worth being a money pit. Are there other repair options? Does drilling cracks actually work? Can I permanently install the seat tube? 

I've switched to a CF seatpost since then, same problem occured, but hair spray come to rescue again. No slipping for months. 

This is exactly the case where Wikipedia comes in handy, here are some quotes from the article on 3D printing with metals: 

The Rotor product you've linked to is supposed to be used with integrated 24mm cranksets, mostly Shimano Hollowtech ones, so that option won't suit for mentioned cranksets. As far as I know, tourney requires square taper bottom bracket and you already said that Claris needs an Octalink bb. You can use a BB30 to BSA interface adapter like SRAM PressFit 30 to BSA Adaptor Kit. With it in place, it's possible to install any suitable english threaded bottom bracket, be it square taper or Octalink. If you don't have a BB yet, you'll have to get one. 

Bike stand. If you don't have it, there are various ways to fix bike in place, but I just hung it from shelve using a pair of leather belts. Bench vice. 

Grind a bit of headset lower cup so the fork clears. It's aluminium and hanging part that rubs the fork serves no structural purpose, at least that's what I think. Use a shim between lower cup and a bearing. See the CAD drawing for details. I reckon the support of cup from top (45deg surface) and outside (54mm inner diameter) should be enough, after all it's the same mechanism that keeps the bearing in place. But to my surprise, I failed to find such a product! 

What's the best way to reattach a new downtube stop? Would I have a stronger bond if the new cable stop was aluminum or plastic? I have a great work space with appropriate ventilation and equipment, but after preliminary research I've found a lot of aluminum specific products (like those used on airplanes) can't be purchased online or by individuals, so whatever product needs to be accessible in that regard. I'm also open to non-adhesive/epoxy solutions, but the tubing is ovalized and very oversized, so using downtube shifter clamps doesn't seem feasible. As a last resort, would using a hose clamp be safe on ovalized, aluminum tubing once I got it tight enough to withstand the forces of shifting? As a last, last resort, I am prepared to run cable housing all the way from the brifter to the cable guides under the bottom bracket. I'd like a pretty bike, but ultimately this one is just for riding and not show. 

I put all the loose ends in them, then with a big sharpie I put an easy label on it so I know where the washer went. It's also nice because it makes really tiny, flimsy bits (like ferrules or washers or bearings) easy to move around and it cuts down on grease and grime contamination. Finally,every tool I own has a thin stripe of safety orange duck tape on it. It makes it easy to identify as my own when I'm in shared work spaces. When I was doing more construction, we'd use a paint marker and write our names on our tools and then put clear tape or some epoxy over it to make it permanent. I try to make my things so visibly mine people feel unsafe stealing it.
