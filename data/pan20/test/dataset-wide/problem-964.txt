Quick and simple answer: A greater greenhouse effect. There is an equilibrium in place. CO2 weathering rates depend on temperature, so at lower temperatures, we see CO2 levels rise, warming the planet. At higher temperatures, higher weathering rates mean more CO 2 drawdown, so the planet cools. This is a very long term process. But this CO2 thermometer effect is believed to be the reason why we have had liquid oceans for all of known earth history. As far as the black body effect goes; this is correct - from the viewpoint of an observer at distance, Earth would 'appear' colder. However, this is because the emission height changes (see $URL$ ) for more of an explanation. Think of it as 'the height at which the atmosphere becomes IR-opaque' (although this is a simplification); the temperature then follows the lapse rate down to the ground. So raising the emission height raises the surface temperature. (NB late at night, add refs later..) 

Pretty confident to answer No here. Tsunamis are caused by water displacement due to earthquakes; this has nothing to do with global warming. Any changes in density would be trivial, and although the water would have more thermal energy, this would not affect or be influenced by the kinetic energy of the Tsunami. The only way in which a tsunami would be made more severe would be that any sea level rise due to global warming would be added to the Tsunami height. 

It's reporting bias, and over longer time spans there's a preservation bias as well since a small eruption like Ruapehu 1995-96 will not show up in the fossil record at all after a few hundred years of erosion. These days we watch the world from far more angles with far greater scrutiny than at any stage in the past so we see eruptions that we would never have paid attention to in the past that's all. That's why there are pronounced dips in the graph during the World Wars, volcanoes didn't stop but people were elsewhere with other things on their minds. 

Surprisingly enough most of the figures I could find were actually about thermal output but back working the figures, and assuming I read the formulas properly (not guaranteed I'm afraid) it looks like 5-7 litres per second is the ballpark average gas flow based on fifty years worth of data from several fumarole fields in the central North Island of New Zealand. I have no idea how representative that figure would be of fields elsewhere. 

The only thing that's clear from that photo appears to be the colour, if it is as silvery as it looks I'd say it's Galena, Lead(II) Sulfide, you're looking for a specific gravity of about 7.5, Pyrite is only around a 5 and is also a gold colour. It might be Chalcopyrite but that should show some purples in it's colour which don't seem to be present. 

Brief answer (on tablet) When an oceanic plate is formed, the crust is hydrated by the hydrothermal vents systems at the ocean ridge where it forms (hydrated means that the minerals are altered to include water in their structure). When this crust is subducted in the ocean trenches around the Pacific, it is taken down towards the mantle; as these hydrated minerals heat up again, they release water. This water then lowers the melting point of the mantle above the descending plate, which melts to produce a basaltic/andesitic melt with a high water content - the water is dissolved in the magma. When this melt reaches the surface again, the high concentration of water leads to explosive eruptions as it comes out of solution. 

I can't see there being any physical cause - the water depths are too great for an ice mountain and the feature cross-cuts other geological features. Plus, it's not aligned with either the spreading axis of the mid Atlantic ridge or normal to it. That means that it is highly unlikely to be a fault or a hotspot track. Given that, some sort of processing artifact seems most likely. 

If hydrocarbons were primordial, then we would expect to find them mostly in areas where the mantle or mantle taps reach the surface - mid ocean ridges, and ocean island volcanoes. We don't. The major oil fields are located in continental extensional basin settings. There is plenty of evidence for mantle outgassing - including all volatile species such as hydrocarbons - in the first few hundred million years. Furthermore, on geological timescales the mantle is still undergoing vigorous convection and can be considered liquid. Is irrelevant. This is simply wrong, if referring to pores that can offer any support against pressure. The crust becomes ductile at about 10-15km, and the mantle at 60+km, meaning that conventional porosity cannot exist. See (1). For the Earth, outgassing was essentially completed billions of years ago, as we can see from isotopic evidence (and I suspect that the moon-forming impact didn't help). 

Could be Jet which is a mineralised form of coal, it also reminds me of several pieces of salt mineralised charcoal I have that I found on beaches in New Zealand. 

There are two "normal" mechanisms for this effect: Clay bonding, the beach sand contains a small fraction of clay particles which bond to the grain surfaces and hold the sand together when dry, this is normally the mechanism where the beach is backed by mudstone cliffs or quite close to river mouths supplying fine sediment to the beach. Evaporite Cementation this is the more widespread and common process then what you are seeing is a small scale, and often abortive/short-lived formation of "Beachrock" this is the most likely explanation and the cause will probably be a rainwater/seawater interaction on the surface of the beach where it is still wet with seawater but no longer wave-washed as the tide recedes. 

It looks, to me, like nothing so much as polished Mookaite, that is agatised coral, mostly found in Australia, the various lines through it are actually coral growth-rings fossilised by silica saturated ground water. 

I can make arguments for half a dozen or more things but the most likely are Agate and Calcite, try a drop of dilute vinegar on the surface, if bubbles form then you have a Calcite, or at least a reactive Carbonate Mineral, if it doesn't react then the most likely answer is Agate or another amorphous Silicate. I say these are the most likely purely on the basis of the commonality of those minerals generally it could be something really odd but I don't enough about the specific mineralogy of South Wales to start on those possibilities. 

What you have probably seen in the movies, as used by the oil and gas industry is reflection seismology. This is where you shoot off a sound source (explosives, airguns, etc) and track the reflections of the sound waves from the various rock layers below the surface. At a smaller scale, there is Ground Penetrating Radar, good for a few 10s of meters at best, which is higher resolution and good for detecting voids. 

You need to define what you mean by 'adding more sun'. I'm asuming you mean 'increase the solar constant'. The amount of water vapour in the air is, as a first order approximation, related to temperature - every degree of temperature rise gives us 7% more water vapour. So if 'adding more sun' increases the temperature then it automatically increases water vapour. Now, to add more sun without increasing the temperature, you'd have to compensate by doing something like painting large areas of land white; this would increase the Earth's albedo, reflecting the extra solar radiation. No temperature change overall, so no water vapor change. The only direct effect of the sun on water vapor is something entirely different - through photo-dissociation. This is where the sun's UV rays directly break up water molecules. However, in order to have an appreciable effect on the day to day concentration of water vapour, you'd need to replace the Sun with a much bigger and hotter star that blasted out far more UV radiation. The problem here is that everyone would die. So as far as the question can be answered, it would be no under any realistic scenario. 

These are identifiers that can indicate advance or retreat, either current or historic, but at a glance there are no definitive signs of any long-term trend in the glaciers' behaviour. This is chiefly because glaciers advance and retreat on a seasonal basis so a particular feature may be the product of one winter of heavy snow (some years ago) or one very hot summer. 

There are a number of publicly available proxy records for sea-level/temperature curves, I'd start with Google Scholar if you want refereed articles but a straight Google search can give you good results if you use the right search terms, like "sea-level over time" gave me some useful results; I'd recommend the Wikipedia result as most useful to you. 

Best guess based on texture more than anything else is Chert, we have a lot of honey coloured chert in my neck of the woods but I'm not sure if it's as common in the north hemisphere. 

There are at least 9 old centres of volcanic activity in Taiwan: The Tatun Volcano Group 15km north of Taipei, they think there are active magmatic systems there but the last eruption was 200,000 years ago. The Chilung Volcano Group in the north is extinct, with no magmatic activity and hasn't erupted in 800,000 years. Mount Guanyin is listed as extinct but not a lot of work seems to have been published on it as a volcano. Caoling Mountain is similarly extinct and no-one seems to have done any real work about it's eruptive history at all. Guishan Island is still active and last erupted in 1795, it could start a new eruption at any stage. The Hai'an Range on the Eastern Coast is tectonically active and has experienced volcanism in the past which could recur at any time depending on the movement along that plate boundary. Green Island and Orchid Island off the East Coast are old volcanoes of the Luzon volcanic Arc and haven't erupted in hundreds of millions of years. Lastly there are the Pescadores out west, 90 odd volcanic atolls and small islands probably all monogenetic in origin (the individual volcanoes erupted only once in a given location but the area has experienced repeated eruptive cycles over geological time) none of the existing members is likely to erupt ever again but new volcanism in the region is likely at some stage. So the long and short is that while it's been pretty quiet in Taiwan in the last couple of centuries there are areas where new eruptive cycles could start at any time at existing sites or new ones. Please note any dates given are pretty approximate. 

Well, one way would be to look through The rock forming minerals and see how many are represented. I strongly suspect that not all would be, so from that perspective the answer would be No. But from an inspection perspective.. For any given mineral structure, we can make changes by simply substituting various cations and anions as in pyroxene; for example, we can substitute Mg(2+) for Fe(2+). Or SiO4(4-) for AlO4(5-) - requiring other changes. So, assuming you had suitable equipment, you could find a naturally occurring crystal that was close to the desired symmetry group and tweak it with substitutions until it matched that group. Or more simply, adjust the pressure and temperature until the symmetry changed. There is a lot of phase space to explore. So from that perspective, the answer would be probably yes, we just haven't synthesized them all yet. 

Let's look at this. A very large number of points for one question. First, the solar system. We do not see any hydrocarbons in the inner solar system (Mercury to Mars). This is because in this region of the solar system, dissociation by solar UV rapidly destroys primordial hydrocarbons. This effect is much weaker further out. Oil well 'replenishment' will happen to some degree over several decades, just from internal migration of oil. Typically only a certain percentage of oil in place is recovered, with the rest left in isolated pockets by the water flood. Give it a few decades and these oil pockets will tend to remigrate and link up, giving the appearance of replenishment. I'm not sure what you comment of The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils. No fossils involved.. That's an unreferenced assertion. Helium is present in Natural Gas as a result of accumulation of alpha-decay particles from radioactive isotopes; we can see this from the massive enrichment of Helium-4 over Helium-3. It's not a paradox; geological structures that can trap methane will also trap helium. The current theory behind petroleum geology is that source rocks with a high organic content (often containing biological hydrocarbons from algae and leaf waxes) are buried in sedimentary basins; at temperatures around 100-150 degrees C this kerogen breaks down to form crude oils (this is verified in the lab). Oil then migrates out of this source rock; if it encounters a trapping geological structure, which need not be sedimentary, then it accumulates as an oil deposit. Gas is similar, with a wider range of source rocks. The physics of how this happens are well known and established. I would also note that we don't see hydrocarbons coming out of mantle-derived volcanoes such as at Hawaii. This is a major problem for any theory of primordial hydrocarbons. Additional Points First, it would be nice if you provided references rather than a link to a book to buy.
