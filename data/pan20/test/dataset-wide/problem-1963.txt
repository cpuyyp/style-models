"Making it clear" isn't accomplished by a Subject Line. You should talk to your manager in person if at all possible and resign face-to-face. That's by far the best way to do this. Follow it up with an email or printed letter, if necessary. Don't worry about the subject line - that's not at all important. Instead, make sure the body of the email conveys your appreciation for the job (if that's appropriate for this situation), as well as conveying your end date, along with any other details that are important. 

Have you talked with him about this? That seems to be the obvious first step - particularly if you have a good working and personal relationship. Instead of just saying "You shouldn't have done that", explain how his leaving without warning puts your work at risk (if it does). Instead of saying that he "should appoint someone in charge", ask him how he wants you to deal with the inevitable times when you need something and he isn't around. When I'm not going to be around, I always let my team know ahead of time, and let them know how to get hold of me should the need arise. That said, my team is well-trained to deal with things individually, and I trust their judgement. So they seldom need me when I'm out. They all know my home and mobile phone number, and aren't afraid to use it when necessary. 

This seems like a clear directive from your boss. I see no room for misinterpretation here. Remember who is in charge and who is not. If you have a good enough relationship with your boss, you can discuss why you think this isn't a good idea. But ultimately, it's not your decision to make. If you cannot change the directive, you'll need to follow it. 

If you have a really great personal rapport with your boss, one that permits casual and very honest communication, this could be okay. If not, your boss may hear the following: 

As a hiring manager, I look at pretty much everything I can find about a candidate that interests me - LinkedIn, Facebook, StackExchange, and anything else reachable by a search. That said, I almost completely discount the upvotes/endorsements/likes that I see on many sites. I know that many are more "friends and family" or reciprocal votes than actual professional reputation endorsements. LinkedIn in particular has systems that beg for endorsements for skills that most of your network has no effective way to judge. And endorsing via LinkedIn takes no time, effort or thought - just clicking a button. Not much real value here. (I personally have been endorsed for skills that I simply do not possess.) The only exception would be a LinkedIn "recommendation" - particularly from someone I actually know, or someone I could talk with. These require real words, real writing, rather than just clicking a "like" button. That might be worth a follow-up to see how real it is. Far better are solid references that will talk to me during a phone call, and answer my specific questions. These have real value. For me at least, endorsements on LinkedIn are not critical at all, and are almost without any value at all. I'd be shocked (and disappointed) if HR took them seriously. 

You need to be a bit more assertive here and put him in his place without going over the top. Take him aside and have a private, calm talk. Something like "X, we both know that you are not my boss. Let's stop pretending that you are, okay?" should help. And the next time he says something to others in front of you implying that he is your boss, roll your eyes and say loudly "Now, now X. We've talked about this before. You have to stop pretending that you are my boss." And don't ever respond to him as you would to a boss. Don't accept assignments from him but only from your actual boss. Do those a few times and hopefully he will stop. If not, it's time to have a talk with your boss. Tell your boss what you have tried so far, that it hasn't worked, and that you would now appreciate some intervention. 

Yes, but "allow" is the wrong word to use here. If your manager tells you to give him access, and if you value your job at all you have no choice. You don't own the code, your employer does. You aren't the manager, someone else is. You don't get to decide who does and who doesn't get to access your code, your manager does. Your manager does not need your permission to access code you have written. Attempting to deny access to code you have written may be a quick way to get denied access to your job. 

When I work with an agency, I try to choose a local agent that I can visit and discuss my requirements in person. I spend a fair amount of time talking about my background, where I have worked, what kind of job I am looking for, and what kind of salary and benefits I am looking for. I also talk about the kind of commute I can tolerate, the kind of corporate culture I like, etc, etc. Basically I want them to know me, and know what I want and need. I give them my resume with a few conditions: 

Whenever you don't know the scope of your job, you need to talk to your boss. In this case, your immediate boss - the one who has the responsibility to tell you what your job is, and what it is not. Go to your boss now, and ask what you are supposed to be doing about looking through emails. And ask what you are supposed to do if you find something suspicious. Taking it upon yourself to "sieve through outgoing employee emails to remove confidential and personal information" may or may not be what your boss/company wants you to do. Doing it anyway, without knowing if it's actually part of your job, puts you at risk. 

Schedule it as a 0-hours, all-day meeting. It should end up as a 12:00 AM event on the invitees calendars. 

It's always okay to ask. If you do, it makes sense to ask about your perceived strengths and weaknesses. But very few would bother to give you feedback - there's nothing for them to gain by providing it. I know I wouldn't. And if you are thinking you can get them to change their mind about your rejection or want to argue, don't waste your time. No hiring manager, HR rep, or recruiter I know would ever go along with that. 

The feedback forms you were given are the vehicle that was available to you for providing feedback. If you didn't use them, you should have. Going beyond that to provide a "play-by-play review" will come off as pretentious and/or condescending unless it is invited. If you still feel that more of your feedback is needed, call whoever is in charge of these seminars. Ask if there is a good way for you to provide feedback that goes beyond what you were able to provide on the feedback form. If the leader agrees to discuss it with you further, then feel free to weigh in with your comments and criticisms. It may still come across as pretentious or condescending - that depends on your skills as a communicator and the receptiveness of the leader. But at least the way it comes across will be limited to this one individual (at least initially). It would have been better if you had asked the lead before the seminar if you (as an experienced R programmer) could audit the seminar (or even better, a draft version of the seminar) and provide detailed feedback on the content. That would have come across as an offer to be helpful, rather than after-the-fact criticism. Perhaps now you could offer to present an intermediate seminar yourself. 

You probably cannot fix apathy. But with your management's permission, you may be able to enforce standards. Talk to management about the need for standards and ask for permission to be the "gatekeeper". Then inform the project leads that they must pass a review of their code before it can be promoted to production. Set up trainings and documentation so that they are adequately prepared, then start the new process. 

Wow. Here's my (somewhat harsh) interpretation. You basically told your boss "We employees aren't mature enough to manage our own time, so you should play the parent role and trick us to be on time." I guess I agree with your boss. I expect people who work for me to be adults and to act professionally. If I call a meeting, I expect people to show up on time and ready to work. If that means they must remember to get off of the phone, use the toilet ahead of time, get a drink earlier and set themselves a reminder, then I expect them to be capable of doing so without constantly being reminded. Announcing the 10:00 meeting at 9:58 wouldn't solve the problem if they aren't able to be professional. Personally, I think you made a big mistake with your suggestion. If you think your boss should change to accommodate you and your colleagues' lack of punctuality, and you aren't seeing the change you expected, maybe this isn't the right work culture for you. Maybe you can find a company that will let people wander in to meetings when they feel like it, while others are kept waiting. Sorry to be so harsh here, but I wanted to be honest.
