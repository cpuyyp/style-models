Let $A$ and $B$ ($A\subset B$) be subsets of a finite abelian group $G$. (For the sake of argument, you can take $G$ to be $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for large $p$, say.) Write $1_S$ for the characteristic function of any subset $S\subset G$. Put the counting measure on $G$ and $\widehat{G}$, so that, for instance, $|1_S| = |S|$, where $|S|$ is the number of elements of $S$. Normalize the Fourier transform on $G$ so that it is an isometry: $|\widehat{f}|_2 = |f|_2$. What upper bounds can be given for the size of $|\widehat{1_A} \widehat{1_B}|_1$? To be precise: Cauchy-Schwarz gives $|\widehat{1_A} \widehat{1_B}|_1\leq |\widehat{1_A}|_2 |\widehat{1_B}|_2 = |1_A|_2 |1_B|_2 = \sqrt{|A| |B|}$. On the other hand, $\left|\sum_x \widehat{1_A}(x) \widehat{1_B}(x)\right| = \left|\sum_g 1_A(g) 1_B(g)\right| = \left|\sum_g 1_A(g)\right| = |A|$, suggesting there might be some room for improvement. So, the question could be made more pointed, as follows: if $|\widehat{1_A} \widehat{1_B}|_1$ is closer to $\sqrt{|A| |B|}$ than to $|A|$, what follows about $|A|$ and $|B|$? What are necessary and sufficient conditions for $|\widehat{1_A} \widehat{1_B}|_1$ to be bounded by a constant times $|A|$? 

One possible approach - which would probably give non-optimal but non-trivial bounds - is to look at the number of conjugacy classes $Cl(G)$ in $G$. Say the number of conjugacy classes $|Cl(G)|$ is $\leq K$. Then, by pigeonhole, there is a conjugacy class $Cl(g)$ with $\geq |G|/K$ elements. By the orbit-stabiliser theorem, we must then have $|C(g)|\leq K$ for some element $g$ of $G$. Question: what upper bounds can one prove on $|Cl(G)|$ (relative to the size of $G$) without using the classification theorem? 

How hard is it to classify all big finite simple groups, i.e., all finite simple groups larger than some sufficiently large constant? Alternatively - how hard is it to classify all finite simple groups up to finitely many exceptions? Is any known proof of such a classification significantly easier or shorter than the classification of (all) finite simple groups? 

Consider the characteristic function f of a disc of radius r. The classical circle problem asks for a bound on the error term in the expression $\sum_{(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2} f(x,y) = closed expression + error term$, where the closed expression happens to be the area of the circle. (The divisor problem is the analogous question for the characteristic function of the domain under a hyperbola $y = r/x$.) Hardy and Landau showed that the error term is no smaller than r^{1/2} or so. Question: what happens if we let f be a smoothed version of the characteristic function of a disc? Does the error term become conjecturally much smaller (how much smaller?)? What has been proven in that case? (Obviously the answer will depend on the extent and type of smoothing - how strongly? Would the classical problem be equivalent to a smoothing where the decay happens within an annulus of constant width?) 

Perron´s formula is in some sense just Fourier inversion, but I have never seen proven it that way in a textbook. I take this must be because the conditions for the Fourier inversion formula to hold may be difficult to verify in this case. Or are they? Is it feasible to prove Perron´s formula using mainly just the fact that the Fourier transform is self-dual? 

I sometimes give roughly the same course in different languages, and update my TeX notes (if any) each time. Keeping all sets of notes current is a pain (and doesn´t always get done). Does anybody know of a system for keeping and updating the same math document in different languages? The text would vary and the math would be the same, except for eventual changes in order due to differences in sentence structure. 

Let $G$ be a $k$-transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $Sym(n)$, $k\geq 2$, $n$ large. (Make $k$ larger if you think it necessary to make the question below non-trivial/interesting.) Write $C(g)$ for the centraliser of an element and $|C(g)|$ for its number of elements. What can you say about $\min_{g\in G} |C(g)|$, relative to the size of $G$? Must it be small? (Note that $k\geq 2$, $n\geq 3$ immediately imply that $G$ is non-abelian (thus making the question possibly non-stupid).) (I should clarify that I expect (hope?) the answer to be quite a bit smaller than $\ll_{\epsilon} |G|^{\epsilon}$. (Assume $k\geq 3$ or $k\geq 4$ if needed.) In this, a $k$-transitive permutation group feels like a different sort of animal from a linear algebraic group $G$, where $|C(g)|$ is most often no smaller than $|G|^{\dim(T)/\dim(G)}$ ($T$ = a maximal torus of $G$).) 

Take an algebraic group $G$ defined over a finite field $K$. Suppose its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple. It should follow that $G$ is almost-simple. (By this I mean not that $G(K)$ is simple -- I've heard there is a tricky though in some sense inessential counterexample -- but rather that $G$ has no normal algebraic subgroups of dimension greater than $0$ and less than $ \text{dim}\, G(K)$.) Does anybody know of a concise and straightforward proof of this fact? One can't proceed as for $K=\mathbb{R}$, since $\exp$ is not defined (except on nilpotent subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$). I feel this should be simpler than studying the simplicity of $G(K)$. Is this so? IMPORTANT EDIT: I just realized that I meant to ask the converse of this question. If $G$ is almost-simple in the sense of algebraic groups, how do you prove that $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple? I agree that the direction stated above is very easy. Yet another important edit: there are exceptions to the converse! See the answers below. They all seem to come from non-trivial centers due to small characteristic. What I really need is the following: Let $G$ be an almost-simple linear algebraic group. Let $V$ be a subvariety of $G$ going through the origin. Assume $0< dim(V)< dim(G)$. Let $\mathfrak{v}$ be the tangent space to $V$ at the origin. Prove that there is no ideal $\mathfrak{w}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ containing $\mathfrak{v}$. (Or, what is the same: prove that the conjugates of $g \mathfrak{v} g^{-1}$ of $\mathfrak{v}$ span $\mathfrak{g}$.) Yet another edit: Aha - not even that is true. Well, can we at least give a quick proof, without case-work, of the following? Given a classical almost-simple group $G$ (defined as a subgroup of $\SL_n$ by means of equations with integer coefficients), show that there is a constant $c$ such that, for every field $K$ of characteristic $>c$, the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G(K)$ is simple. Surely there should be a reduction to the case over $\mathbb{C}$, or a proof from scratch? 

Let $G=SL_2(\mathbb{Z}[1/2])$, i.e., the modular group (if you wish) over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2]$ consisting of rationals whose denominators are powers of $2$. Unlike $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, $G$ is neither simple nor almost-simple: for example, it is possible to define congruence subgroups (for odd modulus $N$). Is there a non-trivial (i.e., neither $\{I\}$ nor $\{\pm I\}$) normal subgroup of $G$ whose intersection with the unipotent subgroup $U = \left(\begin{matrix} 1 & * \\ 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right)$ is trivial? (Of course, such a subgroup would have to be of infinite index; does $G$ have non-trivial normal subgroups of infinite index?) 

Yes, I'd think so. If you have two probability distributions $w$ and $v$, and $w$ has smaller $\ell_2$ norm than $v$, then $w$ is "flatter" than $v$, intuitively speaking. 

Let $K$ be a field. Let $V/K$ be an affine variety in $A^m$. Let f be a polynomial map (and hence a "morphism of finite type") $f:V\to A^n$. A theorem of Chevalley's tells us that im(f) is either a variety or "almost" a variety - that is, im(f) is a variety $W$ with perhaps a few varieties of lower dimension cut out from it. Question: is the degree of $W$ (= Zariski closure of im(f)) bounded solely in terms of m, n, deg(V) and the degree of the polynomials $f_1,\dots ,f_n$ defining f (i.e. $f(\vec{x}) = (f_1(\vec{x}),...,f_n(\vec{x}))$?). This seems intuitively obvious, but I do not know where to look for a reference. (It's also non-obvious how to adapt the proof of Chevalley's theorem I'm looking at so as to give this.) Does anybody where to look this up and/or how to prove this? 

Actually, I now have a follow-up question. How on earth do I list QEPCAD in the bibliography for the answer it provided? 

Let $G = S_n$ (the permutation group on $n$ elements). Let $A\subset G$ such that $A$ generates $G$. Is there an $n$-cycle $g$ in $G$ that can be expressed as $g = a_1 a_2 ... a_k$ where $a_i\in A \cup A^{-1}$ and $k\leq c_1 n^{c_2}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants? What about $2$-cycles, or elements of any other particular form? 

I am looking at sums of the form $\sum_{N\le n \leq N+M} e(P(n))$ where $P\in R[x]$ is a polynomial of bounded degree. Let's say $M\sim c N$ (and $N$ is large). The question is - when can one compute this sum rapidly? By "computing" I mean "computing with an error of less than 0.5" (or "computing exactly", which boils down to the same thing for what I have in mind). By "rapidly" I should mean ideally "in time $O((\log N)^{O(1)})$" - but really I would be somewhat happy with any running time of the form $O(N^{1-\delta})$, $\delta>0$. If $deg(P)=1$, this is easy. If $deg(P)=2$, then complete Gauss sums can help. What is known for deg(P)>2? 

The Barban-Davenport-Halberstam theorem gives a bound for the average (in L_2 norm) difference between $\sum_{n\leq N: n\equiv a \mod q} \Lambda(n)$ and $N/\phi(q)$. It is obvious that a similar result should hold for the difference between $\sum_{p\leq N: p\equiv a \mod q} 1$ (where $p$ ranges only across primes) and $\pi(N)/\phi(q)$. Does anybody know where in the literature a statement in that form can be found (so that it can be quoted without any further ado - the alternative is to spend some space in its derivation)? 

Let $p$ be a prime. For how many elements $x$ of $\{0,1,\dotsc,p-1\}$ can it be the case that $$2^{2^{2^{2^x}}} = x \mod p?$$ In particular, can you find a simple proof (or, even better, several simple proofs!) of the fact that this can happen only for $< \epsilon\cdot p$ elements $x$ of $\{0,1,\dotsc,p-1\}$? (Assume, if needed, that $2$ is a primitive root of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.) 

Following up on Boris's suggestion, let me tell of my mostly happy experience with QEPCAD. First of all - QEPCAD seems to crash on three variables (at least for the slightly hairy expressions we are dealing with here). So we have to start by reducing our problem to a two-variable problem by means of human. The inequality that $A\leq ζ(s1+s2)ζ(2s1+s2)ζ(s1+2s2)/ζ(s1+2)ζ(s2+2)ζ(4)$ would naturally rest on turns out to be false; no QEPCAD needed here (though QEPCAD caught this when fed a special value for one of the variables). If this strong inequality is true, it's doubtful it has a nice proof. Now for the slightly weaker inequality (call it inequality B; it is neither the strongest nor the weakest one) that I mentioned above, namely: $A\leq \frac{\zeta(s_1+s_2)ζ(2 s_1+s_2)ζ(s_1+2 s_2)}{ζ(3)ζ(3)ζ(4)}$; this, as you can easily check, follows if we show that $1 + \frac{y_1 y_2}{(1-y_1+x) (1-y_2+x)} \leq \frac{(1-x^3)^2 (1-x^4)}{(1-y_1 y_2) (1-y_1 y_2^2) (1- y_1^2 y_2)}$ for $0\leq x\leq 1/2$ and $x\leq y_1, y_2 \leq \sqrt{x}$. QEPCAD chokes on this. However, this human realized that, if we change variables to $x$, $s = y_1 + y_2$ and $r = y_1 y_2$, we get that we must show that a polynomial quadratic on $s$ with positive leading coefficient adopts only non-positive values within a range. Hence it is enough to check for $s$ extremal given $r$ - and this happens when either $y_1=y_2$ ($s$ is then minimal) or $y_i = x$ or $y_i=\sqrt{x}$ for some $i=1,2$ (so that $s$ is maximal). QEPCAD proves the inequality very quickly in the first two cases. For $y_i = \sqrt{x}$, defining $x$ as $y_i^2$ (so that we have a polynomial) gives us a polynomial of degree too large for QEPCAD to handle. Inputting a stronger inequality of lower degree (with $(1-3 x^3)$ instead of $(1-x^3)^2 (1-x^4)$) makes QEPCAD give an affirmative answer, thus proving inequality B. 

I've heard a few times that the symmetric group is an algebraic group over a field with one element, and that the alternating group is quite specifically $SO_n(\mathbb{F}_1)$. This does make a lot of sense intuitively, and actually helps to explain to non-specialists the relations between different things I have done. However, objects over the (non-existent) field with one element aren't just a metaphor - they are objects that can be defined properly, though that may not have happened yet. What is the status for the correspondence between $Alt(n)$ and $SO_n(\mathbb{F}_1)$? Is there really a well-defined homomorphism of some sort, and, if so, are there references where this is worked out? 

It seems to be word in the generic corridor that decoupling (as in Bourgain-Demeter-Guth) and efficient congruencing (Wooley) are deeply related, and even that they are deep down the same thing - with efficient congruencing being the p-adic approach and decoupling the real one. Has this remained at a pure "moral" level - an impressionistic statement based on many similarities? Or is it an insight that has given rise to an actual dictionary between the two approaches? What has been actually carried out? 

Is there a smooth funtion $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C}$ such that (a) $f(x)$ decreases faster than $e^{-e^x}$ when $x\to \infty$, (b) $\widehat{f}(t)$ decreases faster than $e^{-|t|}$ when $t\to \pm\infty$? Note there is no restriction on $f(x)$ for $x\to -\infty$ except that it decay fast enough for the Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ to be well defined. The function $f_\epsilon(x) = e^{\epsilon x - e^x}$, $\epsilon>0$, decays almost a fast as $e^{-e^x}$ for $x\to \infty$ and $\widehat{f_\epsilon}(t)$ decays roughly as $e^{-|t|}$ for $t\to \pm \infty$ -- so I am really asking whether one can defeat $f_\epsilon$ on both the physical and Fourier aspect. PS. Yes, this does come from a Mellin transform, as the double exponential probably gives away. 

Let $G$ be a primitive group acting on a set $\Omega$ with $n$ elements. By Cameron/Liebeck (essentially a consequence of the Classification + O'Nan-Scott), there are two possibilities: (a) $G$ has a subgroup of index $\leq n$ isomorphic to an alternating group, (b) $G$ is of size $\leq n^{O(\log n)}$. In case (a), $G$ cannot have a composition series $$\{e\} = H_0 \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft \dotsc \triangleleft H_{\ell} = G$$ of length $\ell$ greater than $O(\log n)$. In case (b), the trivial bound on the length $\ell$ of a composition series is $\ell = O((\log n)^2)$. In fact, the trivial bound on the length of a chain of subgroups $\{e\} = H_0 \lneq H_1 \lneq \dotsc \lneq H_{\ell'} = G$ is also $O((\log n)^2)$. Questions: 

In 1968, Barban and Vehov considered [1] the problem of determining for which continuous functions $\rho:\mathbb{R}^+\to [0,1]$ satisfying certain properties ($\rho(t)=1$ for $t\leq U_0$, $\rho(t)=0$ for $t>U_1$) the sum $$S(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} \left(\mathop{\sum_{d|n}}_{d\leq U_0} \rho(d) \mu(d) \right)^2$$ was minimal. (Assume from now on that $x>U_1>U_0$. They showed that the choice $\rho(t) = \rho_0(t) = \log(t/U_0)/\log(U_1/U_0)$ for $U_0<t\leq U_1$ was grosso modo optimal, in the sense of giving a sum $S(x)$ whose main term is no more than a constant times the minimal value that such a sum $S(x)$ could take. Later, Graham showed that, for $\rho(t) = \rho_0(t)$ as above, $S(x)$ actually asymptotes to $x/\log(U_1/U_0)$. (a) What is the easiest way to show that this is the least possible leading term in an asymptotic for $S(x)$ for any function $\rho$ satisfying the above conditions? (That the order of magnitude is correct is clear from estimates on rough numbers, but such estimates have Buchstab's function in front.) (b) What work, if any, has been done to date on the second-order term in the asymptotics? Graham gave a bound of the form $x/\log(U_1/U_0) + O(x/\log^2(U_1/U_0))$. I recently finished showing that, for $\rho$ as above and $U_0\ggg \sqrt{X}$, $S(x)$ asymptotes to $x/\log(U_1/U_0) - c x/\log^2(U_1/U_0)$, where $c$ is an explicit constant that is positive under some broad conditions ($U_1/U_0\geq 8$). I have no idea as to whether $c$ is the best value one could obtain for any $\rho$ satisfying the conditions. In the range $U_1\lll X$, one could of course compare the corresponding constant $c'$ to the constant coming from Selberg's sieve. At the same time, one could change the conditions slightly (requiring $\rho$ to be the rescaling of a continuous function $\eta$ independent of $U_0$, $U_1$ and $X$, say) so as to exclude Selberg's sieve from consideration -- and then we would only have an upper bound on $c$. Is anything better known? [1] M. B. BARBAN AND P. P. VEHOV, On an extremal problem, Trudy Moscov. Obsch. 18 (1968), 83-90.
