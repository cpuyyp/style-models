Your question was addressed in this randomized control trial that compared the results of two test groups that worked out 5 days per week: one group did long bouts of exercise (20-40 min per day) while the other did short bouts of exercise (multiple 10 min bouts per day). The biggest takeaway from the study was that people were more likely to train when their program is split into smaller doses, rather than one large period. As a result, people on the smaller bout group yielded better results if only because they exercised more overall. From the study: 

Should you face the machine, face away from the machine, or are both okay? How should you position your arms throughout the exercise? For example, should they stay extended the whole way down like you are bowing to someone? How should you position your upper body throughout the exercise? For example, do you treat it like a crunch where you start straight and then curl into your chest? What angle should you be starting at? 90, 67.5, 45? Is there anything else I missed out on that I should be conscious of during the exercise? 

The two exercises are similar enough that you can use them interchangeably if you so desired. Personally, I stick to the standard press and only occasionally use the arnold press to break up the redundancy; even then, I am considering taking arnold press totally out of the lineup because of the strain it puts on my rotators (your mileage may vary). 

There are many different variables at play here, and it's not just restricted to exercise routines... Weight: It takes less effort to push a 110 lb body off the mat than it does a 200 lb body, so by having a leaner body they are more efficient with their muscles. Practice: It takes practice to do complex moves, and flips are certainly no exception. Simply having an identical body type to gymnast does not mean you can backflip. More than anything you need to practice. Muscle Density: I like to compare bodybuilder muscles to that of a peacock... large, beautiful, intimidating, but really just a facade. Contrast this with a strength trainer's muscles which are more akin to a leopard... lean, not very large, but powerful and deadly. Gymnasts fall into the latter category of having muscle that is small, but incredibly dense and powerful. As for actual exercise routines? That I cannot attest to, having never been professionally trained as a gymnast. That said, it should adhere to a few basic principles: 

Again, I cannot answer this question without knowing your height/weight, however I can tell you that this is dangerously low for the majority of people (especially those who are trying to lose weight). When you take into account that you are also burning 350 calories from exercise, your actual daily caloric intake is less than 1000, which unless you are a 100 pound model is not a healthy intake. 

How advantageous is increased cardio + dieting to losing body fat without burning muscle? This is a complex problem. If you do cardio, you are going to lose some muscle. Even some of the most hardcore bodybuilders struggle with keeping muscle while burning only fat. Does this mean you are going to "lose all your gainz" overnight? No. The problem with your plan lies in what it is missing: weight lifting. Without weight lifting being part of your regimen, the result will quite obviously be that over time you will lose your muscle. The nice thing is weight lifting is a form of light cardio, so as the saying goes you can "kill two birds with one stone" by lifting weights to burn fat and put on muscle. If someone were to burn 1000 calories through exercise, but eat enough to maintain a 500-calorie deficit, how is this different from getting a 500-calorie deficit based on diet alone? The difference is that cardio gives you more benefits than just burning calories. Studies show that exercise increase your longevity, happiness, muscle tone, aerobic conditioning, and much more. Cutting 500 calories accomplishes none of this. 

As you have noticed, Stronglifts does not have any direct arm exercises, and relies purely on compound exercises to grow arms. Make no mistake, Stronglifts will NOT give you puny "t-rex" arms, but the arms WILL be aesthetically underdeveloped; this is especially true with regards to the biceps. Where you go from here depends on your priorities: 

Granted he was referring to specifically athletes and sports-related injuries in his quote, but I feel there is enough parallel here to apply the advice to your situation. The advice makes sense when you think about it, when your muscles are tired you are more likely to use poor form and thus more prone to injury. Make no mistake, if you are in the Starting Strength program... your muscles will be fatigued after the workout. The solution to this is, quite obviously, to give your muscles enough time and nutrients to properly recover before you do something overly strenuous. 

Exhaustion If you are accustomed to running in fair conditions and you transition suddenly to hot weather exercise, you will notice that it is much harder to keep up with your previous pace. Running in hot weather takes more effort from your body and as a result you cannot expect to perform at your peak the way you would in fairer conditions. Keep the heat in mind when doing exercise and make sure not to exhaust yourself. Summary Taking all of this into account, you can see that there is nothing intrinsically dangerous about running in the heat... so long as you take the proper precautions. Therefore, whether you choose to do morning, afternoon, or evening runs, as long as you plan accordingly you will do fine. 

If you're very committed and have a squat or power rack with olympic barbell, then this is the best approach for you: use an olympic barbell and do back-squats, then progressively load the bar each exercise to increase intensity. This has been demonstrated to be the most effective way to increase strength. If you don't have access to a barbell, then the next best alternative would be to do goblet squats using a dumbbell. Whether using a barbell or dumbbell, I suggest the same timing frequency, which is: 

Daily workouts constantly stress your muscles but never gives them time to recover and grow bigger. Reduce to 3-4 days a week so they can properly recover and grow. Eight minute workouts are not very intense, so you aren't able to do enough to really grow muscles in that time. Increase to 30 - 60 minutes so you can properly stress your muscles enough. 

Lose weight. Doing cardio to burn fat will make pull ups more manageable, since you have less total weight to physically pull up. You will see biggest gains in this area if you are overweight, but if you are average/skinny, then focus elsewhere. Assisted Pull Ups. This has the benefit of building strength and practicing technique. You can accomplish this via a pull up machine, which helps support X amount of your weight, so you can effectively do pull ups at a significantly lighter weight than your bodyweight, and then progressively increase that amount until you have the strength to do unassisted. Requires gym/machine to do. Resistance Bands. This is another way to simulate a pull-up without having to do full bodyweight. Attach resistance bands to the ceiling/doorway, sit down, and mimic the pull up. Builds strength, less so for technique. Can be done at home with heavy resistance bands. 

Imbalanced routine: You need to balance out opposing muscle groups that are worked out in order to avoid created muscle imbalances. Since your program balances bicep and tricep work, you aren't at risk here (an at risk example would be someone doing a lot of chest exercises like bench press that doesn't work the upper back to balance it out). Improper form: Make sure you have proper form in all of your exercises. This is especially prevalent with the bicep curls exercise, where people seemingly always cheat to get extra reps or extra weight that they shouldn't be lifting. Make sure you review proper form for all of your exercises, and use multiple sources for each exercise to make sure that you don't get any bad or incomplete information. Overtraining: Injuries from overtraining fall into three subcategories: lifting too heavy, getting too little recovery, or exercising too frequently,. The first issue you can avoid by only lifting as much weight as you can do with proper form (and should the form break, put the weight down). The second issue you can avoid by following my instructions in the first paragraph for getting adequate recovery. The final issue is probably what you are most at risk for, and that is something you will just have to listen to your body on. If you find yourself not having enough energy or feeling exhausted, maybe take an extra day off and go to a 3/week routine in the interim. 

As you noted, stretching too far will result in pain and be counterproductive to your goals, but on the opposite end if you don't stretch enough then there is no intensity and no catalyst for change. You need to find your middle ground before pain but after the discomfort that signals the stretch is working. Every person is different and our experience in stretching is highly variable. Knowing your middle ground is something that only you can determine, and it comes from experience, trial and error, and self-awareness. And note that if you're doing the stretch correctly you will be gaining flexibility which means your middle ground should be progressively improving over time. Here are some tips: 

Take off the gloves and straps. Gloves make it easier for the bar to slip, and don't build up grip strength as much as going gloveless. Straps take the load off of the grip, so your grip will get weaker by using straps. Avoid these two things, plain and simple. Use mixed grip. By far the biggest change I ever made for grip strength was incorporating mixed grip into the work set. Mixed grip allows you to lift heavier weights and improved my overall grip strength. Note: I only use mixed on my work set, for the lighter-sets I use normal grip. Use white-knuckling. Read this interview with Pavel Tsatsouline that talks about white-knuckling, or using focused body contractions to improve your grip and overall strength. Use chalk. If all else fails and you are still really having trouble with grip, try chalk out. Some people have very sweaty palms and swear by it, whereas I have fairly dry palms and never noticed much of a difference. Your mileage may vary. 

I never do the traditional sit-up anymore because it puts so much strain on other areas, and there are safer and more effective exercises to focus on. That said, here are some ways you can reduce the strain on your body during a sit-up: 

I believe in balancing the amount of exercise that I give to each muscle group, but recently it occurred to me that my leg muscles might be imbalanced. More than anything, squats are the number one leg workout I do; they are in almost all of my routines. Given that, I was worried that I might be potentially overtraining certain muscles by having such a large focus on squats. If squats are my primary leg exercise, what leg muscles do I need to focus on to in order to avoid muscle imbalances? EDIT: I do medicine ball squats (squat down to 90 degree angle with hands extended holding a medicine ball). I would prefer to do barbell squats, but do not have a barbell rack... 

I have a great baseline of strength because of the barbell strength training programs I have been through. I have already trained my body for similar challenges, e.g. the hundred pushup challenge. I have used the "greasing the groove," technique developed by Pavel Tsatsouline to further increase my ability with regard to push ups. 

I had this problem as well, where I was able to lift the weight easily enough, but my grip was giving out (I almost dropped the bar at one point). Your grip strength will increase as you progress with deadlifts, but sometimes you will need more so your grip can keep pace with your progressive overloading. Here are a couple of tips that have helped me out a ton with improving my grip: 

There are two ways you could approach this, and both are equally fine. The first approach would be sticking 100% to your goal of losing weight. Doing 30 minutes of cardio at the gym, best case scenario you would be burning around 500 kcal / session or 1000 kcal / week. This is roughly equivalent to a medium sized Big Mac meal. I'm not sure what your diet looks like or how often you do basketball/soccer, so I cannot speak to whether or not this gym time will be enough for you to actually lose weight. Suffice it to say, you should always make sure you have a healthy, balanced diet that leaves you at an appropriate caloric deficit for your weight loss goals. The second approach would be to use your time at the gym to improve your strength/power so that you perform better in your favorite activities (basketball/soccer). Example exercises include burpees, squats, deadlifts, box jumping. Personally I would recommend following the Starting Strength program, and supplementing the program with some additional exercises like burpees or box jumping. Both approaches are equally valid and really depend on how you want to prioritize your goals. Personally, I feel the latter approach would have the best reward for you, but ultimately it is up to you.
