Working for free is not professional. Go look for a job, this is either a scam or a company that's highly unprofessional. 

You lied. That is something you should never do. If you admit you lied, you will be out and blacklisted. If you don't send certificates, you will be out and probably blacklisted (failure to provide proof is mostly seen as "potential liar"). You could send the certificates you have and play dumb when they ask questions. If they ask questions, tell them there has been a misunderstanding in the interview and the certificates are proof of what you did before. You will probably not get the job. They might not blacklist you, depending on how sure they are about what happened in the interview. In the future, do not lie. Lying is about the dumbest thing you could do in an interview. It will burn your chances with this company, your future chances with that company and maybe, if people talk, even your future chances with other companies, even if you are truthful with them. 

No No, there is not. While there may be the chance that upon laying you off you may get a severance package, this is not guaranteed by law. They only give it to people because the severance package costs them less then the risk of a lawsuit. While your company has to prove certain things when laying you off in Germany (like there was no other job for you at the company), there is no obligation for your company to provide you with a career. You have a job you are suited for and you get paid the same amount of money as before. This is as good as it gets. After all, they did not lay you off. A word of personal advice: this opportunity is gone. It's over. Anything you do from now on is looking back and living in the past. Look forward, find a new job and proceed with your life and career. Right now, you will probably get good references and you will probably be able to negotiate anything you want concerning your notice period. Use this chance to leave there on good terms. The best way to show them they were wrong to let you go is to be productive, successful and happy at another company. The only "golden" thing you get is that your current employer has to give you time off for your future interviews. However, seeing your bosses reaction, I guess that would not have been a problem anyway. 

There is no way we can answer your question. Consult a local lawyer. However, please note that if you field her previous behaviour as a reason you don't want to cover for her, it may not be in your best interests. You are not doing her a favor. She doesn't gain anything from it. You would be doing your company a favor. It's your company that needs someone to cover for her. It's understandable that after what happened you don't want to work with her. However, working her job if she is absent is something different and has nothing to do with her behaviour. If you don't want to work those shifts because they are too long, say so and ask a lawyer if you can get around it. Do not mention her name because that would look like an excuse. 

The CIO basically is the boss of everything that involves technology. There is a good explanation on wikipedia. A project leader normally leads a single project. That could be, for example, building the infrastructure and software to open up a new logistics center. Or maybe replacing all the old components of a medical software in a specific hospital. Or whatever else business wants done to generate money. To become a project leader, you should probably know the business the project is in and you should have experience leading projects. Ok, that is hard to come by without being a project leader, so most people get in in very small projects or as assistants. Most companies have multiple projects and project leaders, so one can come from the outside or promoted internally. CIO is a different level. The so called C-level (everything title starting with a C for "Chief") is quite unique. You only have one of each in a company, there can be only one chief per field. You can certainly rise through the ranks, but that would mean the old CIO needs to step off or be promoted. Both is unlikely. It's more likely you don't want to wait for that and apply for this position outside your own company, so CIOs tend to come from the outside. There is no set path to become CIO, from the CIOs I have seen, the best have been developers, managers and software architects before. The job of a CIO needs a lot of real world experience. Something you gain either because you open up a startup and give the jobtitle to yourself, or you have 20+ years experience in the field. As always, exceptions apply. Neither project lead nor CIO are jobs clearly defined by a govermnent body (or the IHK in Germany). You don't need to have a certificate. If you wanted, you could found a company and give the title of CIO to your kitten. Some people (me included) avoid management positions. You will find that pretty often in the IT field. Most people go into the field because they like it. They like opening a compiler and coding. Thinking about designs and making them come to live. Once you manage stuff, being it people, a project or a whole company, that time is over. As a project lead or CIO, your day will be meetings. Meetings , meetings, meetings. The time in between will be spent reading the meeting minutes and preparing for the next. The most technical you will get is opening Outlook to check your next meeting and reading email. As a project lead or CIO, you will never open a compiler, use source control or actually see the product. That's three levels beneath you. You will have a meeting to tell the managers what you want done. The managers in turn will tell the architects what needs to be done. The achitects will tell the developers what to do in practice. If you are lucky, you will get an email how it's going. But actually reading and understanding it will be something of a luxury thing while you are on your way to your next meeting. 

First priority should be to get well again. Everything else is only secondary. A year from now, do you think anybody will say "with a five month career gap I would have accepted him, but that 6 month gap is really one month too many"? That will not happen. However, if you don't recover properly, you will have problems for much longer, maybe even the rest of your life. So relax. You cannot change it anyway. Concentrate on a recovery. Not on a quick recovery, but on a good recovery. If you cannot use your CS skills right now, but you do have time to waste, maybe brush up totally unrelated skills. CS is seldom used on it's own. We always work for some industry. Maybe you can get some skills in an industry you'd like to work in. Financial? Business Administration? Project Management? Heck, if you want to go into that industry, even Chemistry or Biology might be helpful. But remember: that is secondary. It can wait. Do not let this get in the way of your recovery. Being healthy and happy is a key skill that will outshine any "month" or "skill" in your personal life. And employers like to have happy and healthy people, too. 

Given that a CV (curriculum vitae) already includes the word "life" because it means something like "the flow of life" in latin, I'd say a "life CV" is redundant. The web found this definition: 

There is really no way to hurt you by making jokes about you, when you do it first. They will either laugh with you (not about you) or they will become bored and just let the topic die. Showing that you can admit and laugh about your own mistakes goes a long way to improving a relationship of any kind, professional relationships included. 

Companies are not welfare organizations. They follow economic goals, namely making money. As such, they should pay their employees what they are worth to the company. If the developer from Karachi can deliver the same value to the company as the one from the bay area, then it's in the companies best interest to hire the guy from Karachi if he costs less. The point is that "everything else being equal" is rarely if ever the case. No two people are equal. If the guy that costs more can bring things to the table that are worth more to the companies bottom line, he is worth more money. Balancing cost and gain, risk and reward is what differenciates propering from failing companies. There is no single recipe for this. 

So maybe your boss does not want this. Maybe he does not want his signature involved either. But at least you showed that inside the legal limits you were willing to provide a constructive solution. 

I suggest you do exactly what you were hired for. You were not hired as anyone's boss, so don't try to tell people what to do. For each vulnerability you find, prepare a report, gather the details so you can prove there actually is a vulnerability and recommend a fix. It's not your job to have people implement your fix. The IT team has a boss and it's his job to take your recommendation and weight risk versus cost. Then and only then the boss will give your coworker a task to actually do as you say. Or not. That's a business decision for someone wearing a suit. With the report sent and noticed, your job is done. People may come off as arrogant and unwilling to cooperate because you are new, you are criticising their prior work as insecure and you try to give them more work. If they do work directly received through you, they get into trouble with their boss, because the work he gave them will be late because they did what you said instead. Good workers don't want to get into trouble with their boss. Once you have gained enough trust in around the people in your company, they will be going over the head of their respective bosses because they know you are right. But that takes a lot of professional and personal trust that has to be earned by years of good work. You are not there yet. You will have to take the normal route, no shortcuts. Do what you were hired for. Report the vulnerabilities and let the suits decide on the consequences. 

I would suggest you check how personal birthdays are celebrated and do something similar. It's a nice gesture, but publicly you should treat the successful end of your Probezeit as something that was bound to happen anyway. Like a birthday. It comes without any effort on your side and is celebrated. An unusual celebration of the end of your Probezeit looks as if failure was something you thought was possible. Don't give that impression. If you want to really celebrate this because it's special for you, do so in private with some good friends. 

This question has at least three sides, so better read it as a whole: First, from an business point of view the manager is probably right when he does not want his team to consist of people of a single nationality, especially if that's not German. I have seen this and there is a very real risk of such a team drifting apart from the rest of the company because they won't even try to get into German customs and following German rules. Prime examples would be eastern European programmers, who would comment their code in Cyrillic letters (probably Russian) despite company guideline to use English, so that their work output is basically worthless to anyone but them. A company cannot take such a risk. Legally, discrimination based on something the person cannot change is forbidden. The relevant law is called the Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (translated: Common Law of treating all people equal). Relevant §§. 

As a first action, you should get your team to actually test anything they think is done. That means somebody else from the team looks at the requirements and says "OK, I tested it, I think you did well, this looks done to me." That way you will deliver higher quality and even if somebody along the chain is unhappy with it, it was a team effort. It's not your personal fault any longer. A more long term solution is to talk about this problem in your retrospectives (they are a core part of Scrum, you have them after every sprint, right?!) and find a solution with your team. I get the feeling you need to improve on your Scrum process as a whole. Maybe get a good book or trainer for this. And get management approval, it's all too easy to say "we are doing Scrum" only to have management continue in their ways of "this just came up, do it now!" way of management.
