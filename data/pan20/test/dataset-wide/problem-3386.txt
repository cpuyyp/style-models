When flapping applies to /t/ in "entertain", "ninety", /n/ actually deletes and the preceding vowel becomes nasalized, so you have [ɛ̃ɾ̃ɹ̩ˈtʰɛjn, ˈnãj̃ɾ̃ɪj]. The explanation for the correlation between these processes is that a syllable-final nasal in contact with a following homorganic consonant can delete, but deletion causes nasalization of the preceding vowel. When the nasal consonant deletes, /t/ then becomes intervocalic. There may be dialect variation in whether or not deletion+nasalization takes places before just voiceless stops, or before voiced stops as well. The test would be whether "banter" and "bander" can be neutralized-- they don't in my dialect, although both /t/ and /d/ flap in underlyingly-intervocalic context (writer, rider). Restricting ourselves to just the variants where n is realized as a nasal, then t will be realized as a stop (voiceless, not voiced) and not as a flap, since when preceded by a nasal, /t/ is not intervocalic. Given the nature of a lingual tap (flap), the tip of the tongue has to be away from the palate and then strike the palate, so between any lingual consonant and a lingual flap, there has to be a moment when the first consonant's constriction is released and the tongue is retracted, and then it can strike the palate. 

My "answer" is more of a comment, but it's too long for a comment. I see at least three distinct questions here. One is whether any language has isochrony; the second is whether every languages has some form of isochrony; the third is whether many languages have isochrony. Taken in reverse order, I would say that the third question is unanswerable for the foreseeable future. The main problem there is that I don't know what number is in the ballpark of "many". If I had 3 purported cases, that wouldn't normally be "many". However, there isn't a huge amount of in-depth phonetic research on a variety of languages, and this is a question that requires a lot of work. There are studies like Lehtonen 1970 Aspects of quantity in Standard Finnish which give a lot of detail of duration in Finnish, but I can't say that there is a single comparable phonetic study of any of the 2,000 languages of Africa, or 1,200 Austronesian languages. For the first question, you may have better luck getting an answer. Estonian (whose durational properties have been extensively studied: Lehiste 2003, "Prosodic change in progress: from quantity language to accent" may be the best "hook" article) is claimed to have "foot isochrony". However, not all feet in Estonian have exactly the same duration, regardless of segmental content. I think the logic of the argument is based on the major incorrectness of the alternative, that duration within the foot is a simple additive function of a constant duration value for each segment in the foot. So IMO, Estonian is your best best for isochrony, and if you find it wanting, that means something. 

You cannot deduce anything from the data. You may conclude, but not all conclusions are deductions. To conclude that there is or is not a contrast in initial position, you have to know the rules of the game. A possible (common) "rule of the game" is "if there are minimal pairs distinguishing X and Y in a position, then X and Y contrast in that position". There are no minimal pairs in initial position in these. However, the minimal pair test is not the only rule of the game. An alternative rule of the game is based on whether there is a rule that derives X from Y in that context. In that case, you would also have to figure out what the rule would be deriving X from Y. Another rule-of-the-game problem (a veritable universal problem in the profession) is that if you have proof that two things contrast, you can say "yes", but you can never say "no", because the question isn't stated as being dataset-relative (i.e. "in these examples..."). For all we know, the next word will present us with a minimal pair. If we assume that "no" is possible for the case where there is no evidence, then "no" would be correct. You should be proud of yourself for understanding the concept "phoneme" well enough to see that even though there are contexts where the contrast is neutralized, those sounds are distinct phonemes. I disapprove of the metaphor that using X vs Y "changes the meaning": the word "dog" didn't start out meaning "but" and change (nor the converse), instead one phoneme occurs in one word (peɾo), and a different phoneme appears in another word (pero). Incidentally, "dog" is [pero], not [per̃o], which indicates a nasalized r in IPA. The evidence that the data are in IPA is pretty much non-existent – an example like rancho would clarify what system is being used. Elaborating on the alternative to requiring minimal pairs ("can you write a rule predicting X from Y"), here is a hypothetical dataset (because it's made up and I assert that these are different words, we don't need glosses). The question is whether [t] and [r] contrast. 

First, regarding the question as you frame it in the title, not all symbols are morphemes. Some symbols (linguistic ones) are sounds (which can be "phones" or "phonemes", if you believe in the distinction). Others are structural categories, such as "S", "Determiner", "Stem", "Place". Second, a symbol is conventionally associated to its referent, not its meaning. Saying that a sign is associated with its meaning is an example of homunculus-theorizing (Cartesian representationalism), which adds an extra step in relating symbols and the real world. Rather than saying that "dog" is associated with the meaning DOG and the meaning DOG is associated with the mental concept of dogs, you can simply say that "dog" is associated with a particular mental concept (which in English is realized as "dog"). In many languages (for example Ancient Greek), roots are not words – inflectional material is required to form a word. Roots are morphemes; roots are symbols. Therefore, it is not the case that all symbols are words (thus "no" to "can symbols be only words?"). Symbols do not include just morphemes, they also include phonemes such as the three phonemes (symbols) in /dɔg/. Numerous symbols, such as "stem", are composed of multiple morphemes, so if you're asking whether a symbol is coextensive with the morpheme, it is not. 

If you want universality, then IPA letters would have to be your base. (Or, one could construct an alternative alphabet that translates the units of IPA into different-shaped letters, but that wouldn't gain you anything significant). You could write German using IPA: Nun, vi solltɛst du "bund" gegɛn "bunt" buxʃtabiʀɛn? (Apologies to German speakers). That is, there are two different German words, spelled "bund" (federation) versus "bunt" (colorful) which are pronounced the same way, because of a rule of German. A "universal" system of writing would disallow language specific rules of spelling, therefore both words would have to be spelled [bunt]. But now you cannot tell from the spelling which word you're talking about (which you can do with the present system). A similar problem arises in many dialects of American English where "writer" and "rider" are pronounced the same, but from spelling you can tell which word was intended. "Universality" works to the advantage of people who don't know the language, but language-specificity can works to the advantage of speakers of the language. By "language", I really mean "idiosyncratic pronunciation of the individual". Some English speakers pronounce "Mary, marry, merry" differently, some pronounce two of them the same way (I think "Mary" and "merry"), and some people pronounce them all the same. A "universal" system is "write the words they way they are pronounced"; so some English speakers would write [meri], [mæri], [mɛri], and some would just write [mɛri]. This would be really confusing, and would make reading extremely difficult, at least for English, given the vast number of pronunciation differences there are. In other words, "universality" works against the desideratum of "efficiency". A universal system would be highly inefficient: you'd need to decide which is more important. 

The basic idea of ToBI comes from the work of English intonationalist in the 70's, especially Liberman and Pierrehumbert, operating within an autosegmental phonological framework. The stipulation that you have only H and L in Tobi is for the most part an arbitrary stipulation, and there is nothing wrong with positing M as a tonal element (as Liberman did). The strongest reason for not including "M" is that it is not necessary. And I should point out that ToBI is more an "approach" than a formal theory, so there is no specific principle prohibiting the addition of other categories. However, the nature of ToBI is that it is a system for talking about categories, and not continua. Thus expanding ToBI to have numeric operators in the representation would totally change what ToBI is. You could do that, but then it would not be ToBI, it would be a new system. Similarly, ToBI is about pitch, and it isn't a general theory of all of prosody. Again, you could construct a new system that is intended to express durational properties, but then you should call it something else -- perhaps DuBI (Du for "duration). 

I don't think a number system can be inherently wrong any more than gravity can be wrong; but a system can be confusing from a historical perspective. Numbers seems to be highly subject to reanalyses. From that number page, you can get additional examples of Mixe-Zoque numerals. These are the numerals 1-12 in Quetzaltepec Mixe, Juquila Mixe, Chuxnaban Mixe, Tontontepec Mixe, (Highland Popoluca), the latter parenthesized since they switch to Spanish for 6 and higher. 

There is something a bit "off" in the question, so it's not clear what you are looking for. It is conceptually wrong to historically "change" Norwegian into German, but you can meaningfully compare Norwegian and German (because they both descended from the same earlier language). You can even give correspondence rules between Norwegian and German (although language-to-language comparison tends to be unreliable if the common language was rather far back in the past). If you just want "comparative sets", I recommend Malcolm Guthrie's Comparative Bantu, which assembles masses of data and has a keying system that allows you to make language-to-language comparisons. (That works by indexing the data to something that is in fact homologous to a historical reconstruction, though he says it is not one). The first volume is full of methodological hints. One way in which you can meaningfully write rules changing one language into another is if the first language actually is the historical ancestor of the other, for instance Middle English and Modern English, or Latin and French. In the latter kind of case, in practice we do not rely just on the facts of French, we look at all of the Romance languages, and that is really how we get the chronology right. The reason for that is, more or less, that the language that Romance languages descended from is not (classical) Latin itself, but a later spoken version that differs from Classical Latin in a number of ways. As an exercise, an instructor might give you words of Proto-Salishan and words of Lushootseed, and ask you to write out the rules (sound changes) that get you from the former to the latter – except, we have no records of Proto-Salishan, and are not really sure about all of the details of the language. Generally, we use the comparative method to figure out what the earlier language is and then figure out the steps involved in getting to specific languages. This requires looking at a number of languages to create a third previously unknown language; so you could look at Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch, German and English and try to come up with something about earlier languages. It looks like what you're looking for is some version of the basic methodology of solving phonology problems, going from underlying to surface forms. There are a number of textbooks out there that do this, though generally they take it to be self-evident how you come up with rules and order them. You might try Introducing phonology which emphasizes methods, although it requires you to figure out what the initial state is (and justify that belief), so it's really more like doing comparative work. 

Ignoring the off-topic aspect of tree-construction, and modifying the example to "The boy will bring my mother Lee's most recent book about global warming when he can" (where you can't rely on gender-to-name correlations), it's necessary to identify two distinct meanings for this, one where the mother's name is Lee, and the other where some other person named Lee has a book. If you can't identify those meanings, that's a problem. If you can, then the question reduces to understanding how to represent an appositive, and how to represent a possessive.
