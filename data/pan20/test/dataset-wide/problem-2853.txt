This is in a text by Frederic Adolphus Krummacher from the 19th century. Another possible origin is in the Phaedrus: 

I take the argument to be more cosmological than ontological. I define an ontological argument as an argument based solely on considering the idea of God. I take Anselm to be the template: the idea of God is perfect in every respect. An idea that includes existing is better than one that does not. Ergo, the idea of God includes that God exists. Ergo, God exists. As I read Anselm, it's not important that someone think this for it to happen or that someone possess this idea. (note that we don't need to go all the way to Kant to find a rejection -- Aquinas thinks this doesn't work). In contrast, I take a cosmological argument to proceed on the basis that some feature of the created order implies there's a God. Thus, the argument from cause raised by Aristotle and Aquinas is that (a) causality happens. (b) cause = A -> B. (c) There must be an A that has no recursive A. (d) that A is definitionally God. This argument hinges on the factual occurrence of (a). I take Descartes' argument to actually be more in line with the cosmological form. Yes, it is about an idea, but it is not that the mere content of the idea produces an existing entity. Instead, it is about the origin of that idea and has precisely the A -> B linkage between an idea of God and some external cause sufficient to that idea. When I used to teach this text, I raised two or three objections. One was similar to the one Jo raises. Another was that we now have machines that seem to be able to produce things greater than themselves (i.e.. several super computers joined together). 

tl;dr - There is another way. it's called utilitarianism. Okay, that was a bit too glib, but let me explain. Utilitarianism is a term with multiple meanings. On the one hand, it's a view espoused by Jeremy Bentham and then a related non-identical view espoused by J.S. Mill. On the other hand, it's a contemporary ethical position when used as a synonym for consequentialism with respect to pain and pleasure. Part of the reason the word has this multi-dimensional definition is that Mill's version leaves some important questions unsolved. Here are a few : 

This seems to be a variation on a Gettier problem where Gettier problems pose issues for justified true belief as a definition of knowledge. Here the poles are reversed and you're asking whether something is a lie if you intended to provide what you believed was false information but end up providing true information due to state changes you were unaware of. Whether what you did is a "lie" hinges on where the priority lies in defining a lie. To a first approximation, let's start with: 

If possibility 1, then Descartes exists. The inference here is if his thoughts are true and one thought is "I exist", then this thought is true. Therefore, He exists. If possibility 2, then Descartes also exists. The added premise here is that only things that exist can think and be deceived. Thus, if he has a false thought, then he is deceived. If he is deceived, then he exists. Thus, by constructive dilemma (take either fork and get to the same place), Descartes infers he exists. This doesn't amount to a blanket "if someone else has thoughts, I know they exist." To return more generally to your question about Descartes' views on existence. There's no where in the Meditations where Descartes draws a generic connection between existing and thinking. He does draw a specific connection between his having thoughts and his existing -- but this argument does not extend to others. Moreover, based on later Meditations, it's clear Descartes thinks lots of things exist including things that are non-thinking -- like rocks, towers, candles. 

The quote you've got there is basically wrong. A more correct thing to say would be that Kant believes the physical world is determined, but that rationally we are free. Or to put it another way, on the phenomenal level, all actions are determined in accordances with the laws of nature (we might in modern parlance says the laws of physics). But we need freedom in order to have moral responsibility. Thus, we are both free and determined at the same time. (This is the third antinomy). I don't read the "refutation of idealism" the way jobermark is suggesting, which is a minority reading among Kant scholars. Instead, the section shows that time and space are not just inner conditions of my experience, but real conditions of my experience, because they occur in a way that conditions my experience before I bring to it my rational apparatus. A key thing to keep in mind is that Kant is a skeptic about the potential for knowledge of things as they are. Conversely, he thinks we can engage in acts of understanding towards objects and perception of sensibles as we bring these under the categories of understanding and forms of sensibility respectively. But it turns out freedom of the will is no such thing, and thus we cannot know it nor can we understand it through our categories. But we do in fact use it and have it. Thus, we are left in apparent contradiction that neither understanding nor reason can settle. As Kant will explain in his moral philosophy, we are in fact free but noumenally free. Meaning on the level of phenomena, all of our actions are determined, but at the level of will and rational action we are in fact free. This might work out to the freedom outside of time that jobermark mentions. But I'm not sure I understand what he's saying there. Because he seems to be saying that this is freedom outside of time in the sense of having been chosen from before eternity -- but I take it to be outside of phenomenal time -- meaning it occurs in a way that is beyond our observation, even our observation of ourself. But the reason for this in Kant's picture is that we are limited to what pure reason determines we can know. And we can only know objects, and freedom is not an object. Ergo, if it occurs in time, we can never witness it. But through reason that we have freedom. 

I would tend to disagree with the quote from stoicfury's answer to the other question -- though not necessarily with the claim as it relates to us. (1) It is possible to articulate non-trumpable types of claims -- the key is just to articulate them in a way that includes that. This may seem merely semantic but it is meaningful. So for instance, if I define the first cause as the cause that precedes all other events of cause, then that definition is not trumpable. It requires us either to deny the standard account of causation or accept there is a first cause. (Generally, those who don't want a first cause assume the former route). What it doesn't do is allow there to be a pre-first cause, because the first cause is definitionally which ever one came first. In this respect, first cause is more a concept than a term that by definition points at something specific. (2) Since it doesn't automatically point at something specific, it doesn't resolve certain questions. Thus, it doesn't mean we can know the specific content of these sort of ultimate terms. At this point, there is room for false identification between something we like and an ultimate purpose. This sort of point is well-considered in Anselm's ontological argument and the debates after that. The trick to Anselm's argument involves compounding multiple features of perfection together. (3) Moreover, a term like "ultimate purpose" is harder than "first cause". Because to get to ultimate purpose, we have to have an account of purpose where it makes sense metaphysically to say there is an ultimate one (e.g. Aristotle's teleology). That being said, I don't think it's automatically a fallacy to assert a first cause or ultimate purpose, and they are not subject to trumping if they are definitionally sound. But what can be subject to error is our identification of a specific thing with an ultimate term -- because that identification can err. (4) You can also choose to deny the existence of any such objects, but then this is not to say that people are using the terms fallaciously -- just that there's something else that makes the terms wrong, i.e. an error in metaphysics or in understanding purpose or cause or motion.
