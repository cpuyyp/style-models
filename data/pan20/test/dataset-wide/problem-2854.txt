From what I can read, this challenge is at least 20 years old. Has any so-called "postmodernist" argued anything against that claim? Or they gave up entirely the claim that "laws of physics are mere social conventions"? I've read the claim. I've read the reasons of the critic, and lots of its originary papers. Please don't ask me to read a 20 pages article as being "the rebuttal". If you can't summarize it in the answer below, I'll assume it's only mumbo-jumbo. 

"Taoism argues that individuality is ultimately an illusion" where does it argues this? Individuality may end with death (I think that's Dao De Jing's point of view), but as we're alive, it is not an "illusion". We are social animals, we are part of a group, but we are individuals too (at least we are not interconnected as coral reefs). "could it be that the current Wikipedia article is overly biased e.g. towards a Christian view on Taoism" Lots of western translations use "God" as the word for "Dao", or use monotheistic assumptions ("eternal dao", "eternal life", "the saint", etc). In common between the two I see: 1) "What others have teached, we also teach: 'the violent ones can't choose their own death', this is going to be our most important teaching" (DDJ 42), very similar to "who wounds with iron will be wounded by iron"; 2) "they have so many goods that may waste them, those act as thieves, of course this isn't Dao" (DDJ 53) has a lot in common with "It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God". But they have a lot more that opposes them. In "catering" the poor, the Taoist counsels to kings and princes would enrich the people. Christianity, with all its moralism, usually lets the people poorer. 

Sorry for the long text, but I need to explain my thoughts well. When it is said that postmodernism gives equal space to all forms of thought, many people think it means they are giving space to non-religious thought. I don't agree. See this sentence, from other post: 

Polytheisms are usually considered mythology (e.g. Greek mythology, Amerindian mythologies), while monotheisms are usually considered religion, or even "truth", and studied by theology alone. To me, however, both look very similar. What are the philosophers, if any, who considers both to be the same thing (theology as a synonym for, or a kind of, mythology)? EDIT after some comments: I accept any definition of myth, since wide answers are usually more informative than narrow ones. I know one can talk about "Christian mythology" (although "Pagan theology" is news to me). But my question is different: have any philosopher considered, for instance, "Christian theology" as being "Christian mythology", i.e. have any philosopher called the god from the Bible a myth, like Odin, Zeus or Huangdi? 

Zhuangzi is regarded as having ideas about the evolution of life, though he haven't found a method, like Darwin and Wallace did. Anyway, he considered human beings as just another animal species, subject to the same natural rules as the others. In James Legge's translation of 至樂 we read: 

Edit for the moderators (and anyone who cares) What I have here is a suspicion, actually shared by a number of important intellectuals and other less known people, thus not exactly a 'personal philosophy', but a real inquiry. I have given lots of references for that. My question is why most people don't seem to agree, or even see, that point of view, since it looks so clear to many of us, and also if any respected intellectuals have addressed the question or not. This is totally different than just asking if I'm right or wrong, as you imply. As some have noted, this close is looking arbitrary and political, more than anything else. In a recent decision from the Brazilian Committee for Biosafety regarding the approval or not of a certain transgenic seed, I've read the delegates votes and their reasoning. Actually, the only one who presented any reasoning was the only vote against the approval. In three pages, the delegate presented a list of reasons why he thought that seed wasn't safe enough for mass production. All other delegates (about ten) just voted in favor of approval, without at least arguing why they thought the other delegate was wrong. You don't need to do this in Postmodern times. "Each one has its own truth", so what's the point in debating? Postmodernists don't see any sense in trying to reach consensus. I'm not sure if the ten delegates received any money to help them decide their votes (what is probable), the biggest problem is that they're allowed to vote without explaining their reasoning (what's scandalous, since there were strong reasons to vote against the approval). This "death of reason" is the utmost tragic consequence of Postmodernism. That Postmodernism is indeed harmful to the Left is something very few people have noticed in its early days, but now in Trump's era it's becoming more and more evident. The number of critics against Postmodernism is not only huge, but many also come from very respected intellectuals. When Derrida earned an honorary degree in Cambridge, for instance, some of them (including Barry Smith, Hans Albert, David Malet Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Willard Van Orman Quine, Peter Simons, René Thom, among others) signed a letter of protest, where we can read (emphasis mine on this and next quotes): 

I ask myself: what is the difference between "Primordial essence or fundamental nature of the universe" and "nature" itself? None that I can think of. So I'm translating Dao as Nature. The gods usually represent the different forces/effects of Nature, so they are pieces of Nature. Dao De Jing 4 says that Dao "looks older than the gods". 

I have pointed out some other critics elsewhere. But what really bugs me is how many philosophers (and philosophy students) insist in seeing nothing wrong with it. The question is: why? Haven't they thought enough about it, and just assume that such a great and fashionable movement "must be right"? They see in it an opportunity for their own individuality and lack of interest in the "greater good"? Have they thought enough, and really believe Postmodernism is the way to the "greater good"? Are they far enough from the "third-world" so as not to see what's going on there? Had any philosopher published his honest views on this point? PS: All these questions apply not only to philosophers and philosophy students, but also to the users and moderators on this site. Note: Six hours after the question was posted, with 400 views (a personal record), it had 3 votes for closing. Like I said, the Right hates questions about the reality of facts, accepting only questions that allow the students to display the endless hours of reading about texts that not always are useful to society. What a shame! (For comparison, this other question, related, had only 95 views in 3 days...) EDIT As you can see from the personal account below, one doesn't have to write (or think) like postmodernists to realize that there's something utterly wrong in "philosophy" courses (and this site). I wouldn't wonder if all moderators here are Caucasian Western men, full of bias against anyone else (and still defending Postmodernism...). 

Since this is not a usual perspective on the subject, I'll try to explain it more: Natural sciences look for common rules, for what remains equal among the diversity. But the diversity is the core of biology - the science that may be called "central science" for its relation with all other sciences. Applied to politics, only ignorance in biology could lead a people to destroy the diversity, instead of defend it. Postmodernity pretends to defend diversity, but denying the equality, the logics and the reason behind the diversity, leads to fragmentation, which weakens those who make up the diversity, and strengthens only the ones who already possess the media channels and other infrastructure to sustain power. 

I think monotheism has its blame. Polytheists know they only have different mythologies from other peoples, while monotheists put the difference in terms of us (correct, good, saved) against them (wrong, bad, cursed). China, for instance, has not gone imperialistically beyond their linguistic territory. India has kept many different cultures, languages and races in the same territory. Samuel Huntington, in "The clash of civilizations", shows a graph where muslims are the "civilization" more involved in wars. It seems to me that judeo-christians come right after. I'm not saying polytheists don't make war. They only have one reason less to do it. And in many cases that's a strong reason. 

What you call foolish is actually 殆已. 殆 may mean "dangerous", "perilous", "to endanger", but also "almost", "probably", "only". According to Chinese Etymology: precarious / dangerous / danger / perilous / tired / afraid / nearly / almost / only / merely / even So, it looks even worse than "foolish". I partially agree with the interpretation of Fatto Lee. But I don't think "rationality" is a state to be avoided. It's part of human nature. I think taoism is more against an excess of reason, reason disconnected of emotion, of balance, spontaneity and common sense. As the Dao De Jing emphasizes: "flexibility overcomes rigidity". 

Along all the text, Schopenhauer gives some names, like Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. However, does he (or someone else) give a full list of the authors he believe "write for writing sake", thus "lacking in definiteness and clearness"? It would be great if it included examples of sentences that illustrate what he says. 

Some years ago, there have been a dispute between two totally different philosophies: 1) The concept of "End of history", proposed by Francis Fukuyama, meaning that western liberal democracies are the cream of human civilizations, thus nothing else have to be achieved, beyond the remaining of the world walking (or running or crawling) towards the "West". 2) The concept of "Clash of Civilizations", proposed by Samuel Huntington, meaning that the western idea of civilization is just one among many, and history is far from an "end" (if such concept even makes sense). After so many recent phenomena, like September 11, the Muslim growth over Europe, BrExit, China economical and geopolitical ascension, crisis after crisis since 2008/09, the election of an improbable figure like Trump... are there any serious philosophers still defending the "End of History" theory? 

I wonder how much of western philosophy is linked to western religion (i.e. judeo-christian monotheism). That was one of the main criticisms proposed by Nietzsche, that's why he attacked so many philosophers, and that's why many people today consider him to be relativistic/crazy/outdated/etc. And western religion IS "Inherently Patriarchal and Mono-racial". No need to explain the "Patriarchal". The "Mono-racial" goes in many ways: africans seen as a "cursed tribe", amerindian culture almost destroyed (and still being destroyed), eastern thought ignored even by lots of western "philosophers", Jesus represented as a tall, white, blonde, blue-eyed man, not to mention the way jews mix race and religion, accusing of "racism" anyone who attacks their elitist mythology. EDIT: The Platonic idealism is so deeply intertwined with the western thinking and monotheistic religion that perhaps it is by itself a good definition of "western". 

It seems that postmodernists disguise as Left (with themes like diversity, etc), but are actually favoring the Right. Why? When they attack modern science (examples here, here, here and here), they are attacking the only force strong enough to counterbalance organized monotheism. They are defending the same obscurantism (be almost impossible to read and understand seems to be a rule - examples here, here and here) that made organized monotheism thrive. Also, when they say "each one has its own truth" (examples here, here, here and here), they are dividing people, and this is good to who's in power now. "Unity makes strength" is a Left motto, and postmodernism goes straight against it. Chomsky's critics are in that line, and Chomsky is anything but rightist. Now, if many critics come from the Right political wing, then they are 1) part of the plot, or 2) equally fooled. EDIT @Not_Here asked for references, so here is the first. The core of Noam Chomsky's critic against what is called Postmodernism: 

It seems that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle contradicts your hypothesis. No one can know the position and speed of a particle at the same time. Trying to find one disturbs the other. That's why science is always probabilistic, not deterministic. 

Zhuang Zi addresses exactly this question in his most famous "butterfly story", that goes in short like that: "Zhuang Zi dreamed he was a butterfly enjoying its flight from flower to flower. After awake, he questioned if he was Zhuang Zi who dreamed of a butterfly, or if he was the butterfly, dreaming that he was Zhuang Zi. But between Zhuang Zi and a butterfly, he says, there must be some difference." As you can see, he doesn't care to give a straight answer. You can live pretending you're dreaming. But probably you'll be taken as a fool, because between real-life and a dream "there must be some difference". Everyone knows it. We can guess most other animals know it too. It's common sense. It's (usually) necessary for survival. And you simply don't have to proof common sense. What needs proof is that which goes against common sense. 

The point here is: there are no certainties. You can never be sure, so solipsism is still a possibility. However, if you're alone in the world, this brings two practical problems: 1) Your existence would be somewhat miserable, wouldn't it? To think that every moment, since you were born, since you breastfed in your mother, you were always alone, is very... empty! The emotional on us, our instincts, surely deny this. And intuition is a very strong form of knowledge. 2) Looking through parcimony, it's easier to accept that other people like us exist (materialistic view) than to think they're all some kind of dream (idealistic/metaphysical view). I don't see any good reasons why a metaphysical view should be more important than a material, sensorial view. 

I want to know how much the Enlightenment philosophers knew of the works of Confucius. This page cites a translation from 1687 into Latin, while Wikipedia talks of 3 different translations before 1700, apparently all into Latin. I think it's safe to assume that any philosopher at this time could read Latin. 

"have I missed something"? Yes, you probably missed that there are a lot of people just trying to confuse us all (yes, these nihilists, sophists, deconstructionists, postmoderns) and who love to make a simple idea seem very complicated (when a good philosopher - at least to my taste - can do exactly the opposite). But anyway, I think Descartes was, for all practical purposes, right. Only he could have made it better: "I feel, therefore I am." Less anthropocentric, I'd say. 

*. emergent properties To me De describes the difference between a healthy organism (a person, another animal, a plant...) and an unhealthy one. The difference between a tree growing free and another limited by a fence or a roof. Like the "skies" that give 命 ming (destiny, fate) to each person, De is also part of the "cultivation team" - which starts with 道 Nature and then to other things in chronological order: 德 De - the general health and all the nutrients needed for a "perfect" development, from where a simple, easy, spontaneous behavior have arisen since the dawn of the evolutionary process; 物 Species - the specific patterns that make one species different from its closest relatives (and a being from its brothers and sisters) is far more recent in the history of Life; 势 Environment - gives the last word, the fire in the oven giving the shape of the cake despite the recipe, the one who will, until the last day of our lives, mold genotype into phenotype. Thus: 道 Nature -> 德 De -> 物 Species/Being/Body** -> 势 Nurture/Culture **. 物 is often used in 万物 meaning "ten thousand beings" (not "things", since 物 gives the idea of two animals, probably an ox and a boar). Even aliens, bacteria, algae and virus fit here, but since we humans are animals (vertebrates, mammals, etc), the study of the animals (zoology, ethology, comparative embryology...) gives us countless hints about the deep meanings of this ancient text. Studying the lack of violence proposed by the Dao De Jing, we find another path to Spontaneity, to a "break of the chains": the war, the direct conflict, is usually avoided in most animal species, transformed in ritualistic aggression, usually a display of size, colors and sounds, all reflecting the power of the owner. If avoid conflict is the rule in the animal kingdom, then to "respect Nature" and "avoid the use of armies" (DDJ 31) is just the human animal following its instinct. Being itself, spontaneous, natural. (We are peaceful by Nature. A high dose of pain or propaganda -- as Noam Chomsky reminds us -- is needed to make us approve of a war.) Would Spontaneity, maybe Health or something in the sense of Darwinian adaptation, be good translations for , in this naturalistic, materialistic, even Marxist, present context of the Dao De Jing? Or perhaps some other word, in any language, could convey a closer meaning of what the original author have probably intended?
