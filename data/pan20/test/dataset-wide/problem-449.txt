The creatures that nest on them would need to provide them with something, so perhaps they are small herbivores or omnivores (since meat is more efficient food) that spend the majority of their time in the air, but feed from the oceans or forest tops. Their droppings and leftovers are used by the balloon-whales to supplement their diet and energy requirements (or protein requirements, whatever). Given this arrangement, your large never-landing creatures could be sky-sharks. Like sharks, their offspring are born ready to fly and hunt. They feed on the smaller air-dwelling creatures, particularly by snatching them as they descend for food, in droves. With a sufficiently large wing-span, carnivorous diet etc. they could possibly sustain themselves and rest while flying. Many sea creatures sleep while swimming and some birds can sleep while flying so this isn't that far-fetched. 

I wouldn't say that making a world richer than necessary is a problem - it can prevent a lot of problems as well. However, I understand you might want to keep development tight and close to the task at hand. I believe the best way to fit time and effort to the required detail would be a pass-based approach, much like a pass-based renderer. This would require defining an algorithmic method to creating worlds and settings, which isn't as complicated or rigid as it sounds. 

That's a map taken from Wikipedia showing the distribution of Y-DNA haplogroups in European populations. Now, I don't really know what a haplogroup is, but as you can see, there is a clear racial and phenotypical distinction there. edit - Wesley Obenshein explains this more in the comments Here's a link to a world map of the same: big picture The issue here is, there doesn't seem to be a timelined map giving us how these distributions have changed over a few millenia (which is the smallest time scale necessary to make any conclusions - and that's still very generous). What we do know is that even with relatively low tabooing of interbreeding, as has applied to our world for a few centuries and less as populations have grown, we still have pretty distinct racial appearances. You can still tell people apart and assume a genetic ancestry even when the differences are subtle. This means we can assume that barriers and distances don't need to be that large to maintain differences. How convenient :P The question on minimum distance remains. Is there really a minimum distance however? Depending on whether you've got non-human races in there, many factors could contribute. According to this forum post for instance, sunshine is a determining factor in the levels of skin pigment. If the desert is in the middle and the world rotates around its star like ours does, it wouldn't matter if you're in the desert or not, but if you're around the equator or not, to get darker skin. That doesn't have to do with distance. Many such factors can be included, but this is overt enough to be easy to use. So the minimum distance probably has to do more with population concentration and how much these populations operate as a whole or separately. A good way to work up to distances would be to distribute the land according to the success of each civilization. If they're more successful, give them more space and have all those inside that space be of the same race. Larger spaces will have higher tendency to include variations and individuals or communities from other races. The last distribution implies that the minimum distance would depend on the total available space. But obviously, if there's too little space there might be little to no variation at all. If there's too little climate variation, there's less racial variation as well. So now the question becomes, how large can communities grow? Obviously this has a relation to technological level and resources/food. Wikipedia gives us some numbers: $URL$ They range from a few thousand in Neolithic times to 50-100 thousand in the Iron Age. We could take population densities and the size of countries at those times as a reference, but those depend much more heavily on how much space and resources are available while the settlement sizes are a better indication of how many people are willing and capable of living together in stable populations. Lets take the areas covered by those settlements though, as it would be an indication of how close together people are willing to live. Wikipedia states that one of the largest Neolithic settlements spanned 15 hectares, which is .15 square kilometers. That's a square about 400 meters on each side, which is not much. To compare, Babylon was about 9 square kilometers in size and had at one time up to 200 thousand people in it. To get what you want, work backwards from these. 

I think that a city-planet would be hard to come up with as a solitary idea and convince different nations/worlds to cooperate in building it, since it would most likely be such a huge undertaking, it would have no precedent. Trading and travelling can be done without a huge construct like that, so there would be no reason to come up with the idea. However, people didn't come up with the idea of building each major city in history, it pretty much happens cumulatively. A possible, in my opinion, origin for such a city-planet would be one that circumvents the need for deliberate planning and cooperation, such as the following: In the beginning there was trade You have multiple worlds across lots of star systems with interstellar travel fast and practical enough for trade and casual travel (much like Star Wars, which had Coruscant). There are various space bases and trading posts across intermediate star systems, orbiting planets usually but sometimes oribiting the local star directly, due to practicality or choice by the owner to build it there. Trade routes pass more often through certain systems than others. In fact, at some relatively distant point in the past, most routes go through a specific star system with multiple bases due to how much trade and travel goes through it. The system is so popular because it stands between large clusters of star systems and thus it forms a convenient trade route to other large clusters due to low amounts of celestial bodies (asteroid fields etc.) and is the safe and common path for trade. The popularity of this system as a trade node and passage point attracts trade through itself from neighboring systems and alternative routes. Everyone puts their eggs in one basket As time goes on, the bases are going to naturally grow and expand - they might be privately owned and operated or operated by states, but it's irrelevant - their holders compete to attract more trade and travel through their own station/base. Some people work there, so there's some dwelling accomodations. Trade cooperation happens and some bases decide to merge for mutual profit - smaller owners can't compete, so they merge to stay in the market, larger owners subsidize trade through them and welcome the new additions to their own base, which gives them more capacity and a share of the profits of others. Considering that there's lots of different worlds moving in and out and a lot of transactions happening, as the bases coagulate into a single main one, there is political and social interest in regulating it. If it is such an important node to the entirety of a huge number of star systems and worlds, there is mutual interest to keep it running and grow it. So it grows in the same way as before. Private owners attach their own expansions, some for dwellings, some for shops, some for products, others for depots and craft maintenance. To keep everyone satisfied, a sort of representative body is established to handle administrative matters. Due to social structures on the worlds using the station, a cellular political structure, based on voting and station section hierarchies is established. The biggest space bar in the universe The station grows, until it is so massive, it's the size of a small moon. Give it a few thousand years and in the intermediate time, it has been slowly moved out of its parent planet's orbit (if it orbited a planet in the first place) and is now as big as an earth-like planet, orbiting the star of the system. It becomes the center of political and economical matters since it is effectively neutral ground and all trade routes go through it (or most at least). People are born and die on it, it has enough mass to have regular gravity on its surface (although by this point, generating and regulating gravity technologically is probably to be expected) and it is, for all practical purposes, considered a planet. Have you been reading the funny pages again kid? Assuming you have multiple worlds across multiple systems, the material isn't hard to find if there is enough mining. You don't need to strip planets clean - there's lots of ore and metals available on space rocks, clustered conveniently in asteroid fields. A bit of this from all the systems would easily allow for enough high quality material and mass to create a planet-sized body. And there you have it: Coruscant :P Noone needed to come up with it - it just happens given time, fast enough travel and enough star systems with their own trade structure. It has a hybrid government to manage it, slowly growing out of small practical needs. It was never the best idea out of many - it's just the best option now, since it's already there. 

I don't think that an atmosphere can extend that far because if gravity is holding it to a planet and said gravity becomes strong enough, it would instead compress the gases into a liquid instead. But! You could possibly have a supermassive gas giant or brown dwarf and place the asteroids inside its atmosphere. I remember reading that this is possible, but I don't have a link at hand. Their sky wouldn't be blue of course and they might experience a very different day-night cycle if at all, but it is within the extreme theoretical limits. Alternatively, you could just place dwarf planets in there. 

Underground defensive structures can be an outgrowth of escape tunnels (for example, while facing a large invasion army while having a very small army on your side). Even with small or no changes to how physics works, people would still use and develop technology along existing lines of development - so, for instance, if people used to make overground structures, but some warlord employed technology and strategies taking advantage of their weaknesses so severely that they became useless, forcing people underground, it could explain why you'd see a lot of them around. If others imitate the same methods and technology (very likely if they don't have the time or means to come up with better ideas or the application of other methods doesn't catch on enough, considering underground structures are the target now) it's likely that you'd see widespread use of underground defenses, possibly even adaptations and structures not employed in real life due to lack of need (no need for us to have ways to mitigate liquids poured into shafts or vibration siege mechanisms in the 14th century) - we'd come up with sewage systems and flushing toilets sooner I suppose. They could also be a side-effect of landscape features or lifestyle. If there's a lot of sharp elevation changes and/or a strong need or adaptation to mineral and metal use, chances are lots of people would want to stay closer to their work or prefer tunneling into a mountainside instead of building a castle on a slope at a large angle. Obviously, a large mining colony underground would require safeguards to not die from fumes and dust, but people are resourceful enough in fantasy settings :P 

The answer isn't simple because you need more than physical distance and barriers to accomplish variation. It requires said distances and barriers to hold over long periods of time and allow for long periods of little contact as well. A good rule of thumb would be to take real distances as a starting template and then work through your constructed history to arrive at mixtures or backwards from a set of differences you want to achieve. That said, we should be able to work backwards through our own history and at least get some numbers to work with. 

A cave, mine or tunnel could be used. Since they can be artificial and cave systems can be pretty similar, if your characters had access to one, they could attempt to use it as correspondence. If I understand correctly, the idea is that, when someone is in an area, the "travel" places them in a practically identical area somewhere else. The strength of a correspondence will be directly related to how little you notice changing while the outside world (outside the correspondence node) changes. If I am correct in this understanding, then artificial construction and especially more generic ones used for utility and thus strongly resembling each other across cultures and places, would be the easiest way to achieve travel. That's why I'm suggesting something that is likely to exist in both locations. I noticed others are suggesting the sea, but it's unclear to me how far the australian or british locations span - do they include the seaside or ocean or not? If they do, the seaside and beaches would be easier, assuming one can find a beach that resembles the one at the target location. If a beach is inaccessible, then I would expect that a mine or dug-out cave, perhaps even a simple house (clay, stone, wood) would work. edit - there's also some simple ancient structures (particularly neolithic ones) that are easy to replicate: $URL$ 

Assuming there's only trace amounts of metals (enough for life but not enough to work with), there's some stuff that could possibly be replaced: 

I see no reason why they will lag behind, refuse technology or not have knowledge of it. Immortal engineers In fact, I think it's more likely that given their long life span, they might have some of the greatest experts in some fields - certainly not because they're cleverer, but because they have more time to learn things (and learn many disciplines well, which is an advantage) and less of their experts will die of old age, leading to having many of their accomplished engineers and scientists alive centuries after their breakthroughs. They might not really be much better than humans, dwarves or others in inventing new technology or engineering it well, but they do inherit a great amount of cultural pride, which, due to their lifespans, is unlikely to change much and doesn't really get in the way in terms of population evolution, simply because of the enormous amount of experience individuals aggregate over the course of their lives. This pride will surely get hurt if mere humans and especially dwarves (again, if elves are stereotypical) have amazing technology and they're still dependent on breastplates and swords. Survival Also, technology is unavoidable - without it, they won't be able to defend themselves from a point and on. Would they really trust what they see as violent humans, greedy dwarves, animalistic orcs with muskets, tanks, rockets, machine guns and nukes, without making sure they can protect themselves and fight back? While having an extra-dimensional island to escape to might not be part of every setting, even if they do have such a means of escaping danger, it won't always be available wherever they are and, since it's part of the universe, other races can and eventually will find ways to access it. Would the cautious and un-trusting elves allow themselves to be caught off guard? They might let humans fight their own wars and not intervene, but they won't let them march against their own lands uncontested. Without magic, how would they solve any of these problems? Elves often embody the "sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" thing in stories - swords crafted so well they can cut anything, bread made so well it fills you up after a bite, armor both flexible, comfortable, light and still stronger than any other armor. These are not always the result of magic but often the product of incredible craftsmanship. Why do they give such a technophobic impression though? I think this lies at the heart of how they're contrasted with humans. Elves are ancient, cautious, proud, contemptuous of younger races, believe in established and old ideals: they're portrayed no different than wise elderly people, without the "elderly" and without having to be likable. This naturally is linked, in our heads, with technophobia and the rejection of new things: because old people tend to be like that. But Elves are not old people that just have automatic plastic surgery and you can't get rid of them. They're a race, perhaps a species even, with a successful civilization and, from all the ways they're portrayed in classic fantasy fiction, a healthy technological understanding, often ahead of that of other races. If they really were technophobes, they certainly would not be known for their craftsmanship and skills. Another parallelism is perhaps to comfortable aristocracy, which I think is reflected in the dislike other races may have for elves in some settings - they see elves as incapable of understanding the threat of aging, hunger, illness etc. . This is unlikely to have an impact on technological progress I think - if this is nothing more than how they're perceived, it's not a characteristic - but if it is, comfort and lifestyle take work; if that work can be done for you, without having to depend on others, why reject it? I would like to remind that they wouldn't just get placed in modern society out of nowhere - they would live, for milennia, in a world growing and changing, with new technology arising all the time. They may be reclusive, sure - tucked away in their forests, sure. But even with that trait, I can't see them having virtually no contact with the rest of the world and certainly can't see them abstaining from technology. Because that's not how elves work and because they couldn't afford it.
