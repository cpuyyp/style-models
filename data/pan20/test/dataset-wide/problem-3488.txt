If you had 12,000 dollars owing on a loan, 10,000 dollars cash in the bank and 1000 dollars monthly expenses, but you weren't sure if incoming cash flow could stop for 6 or 12 months, any time, with no notice, would you deplete your entire cash stock to reduce debt? At that point, if your next paycheque was a week late, you would go hungry. Or, assuming that you had assured your basic subsistence, you might find yourself with no money to buy some other basic things that make your life a lot easier or more efficient. Otherwise stated, there's a reason that a common measure of forex reserves is "Total reserves in months of imports". Basically, if India used all of its forex to pay off external debt, then on a moment's notice it could have zero (or at least highly constrained) ability to access critical inputs into production processes. The highly negative impact that autarky or excessive focus on self sufficiency (beyond subsistence needs) could be highlighted in the context of this explanation. Also (among other things), while a lot of economists disagree that using forex to manage an exchange rate in a situation of short-term crisis is a good idea, it is logically true that if you have no forex then this option simply does not exist. For a specific example of how this can be a problem, you could refer to the story of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. In response to this crisis, most central banks in Asia undertook to substantially increase their forex holdings in order to not suffer a repeat of such a crisis. 

Because that's the law as written. It's related to the ability of the US to disallow international financial institutions to interact with the US market unless they play by the rules of the US market. This extends way beyond the question of transacting in USD, and includes many requirements such as ability to flag transactions of types that may be involved in money laundering, terrorism financing, etc. 

It is common that very poor countries also have very low unemployment rates. A typical reason for this is that a large share of the population can always engage in subsistence agriculture, in which case they are both employed and also poor. However, despite the presence of near-subsistence agriculture in some regions, Mexico is a middle income country and not a "very poor" country, so without looking deeply into the data I would not assume this to explain even close to all of the observation. It could also be related to a) how poverty is defined and the effects that income inequality can have in the context of the specific definition (e.g., a large share of the population earning less than 1/2 of mean or median income, but still able to access basic housing, nutrition, communications, education and health services), b) the minimum wage, for example if it is very low you might have a lot of people working but at a very low wage (consider this in an ideologically neutral sense, since even if literate this does not necessarily imply that skills matching in the labour market can "handle" a higher minimum wage), c) whether a national poverty rate is applied to areas where housing expectations are met at a much lower cost compared to the capital city (or any other major cost differentials that are not adjusted for due to using a national poverty line instead of adjusting for regional cost variations), ... Also, consider that the stats are usually for market income, without imputing the value of public services such as health and education. This is among some variety of reasons to prefer consumption indicators of wellbeing instead of market income, despite the shortcoming that there is always some subjective element in the evaluation. 

Re: main question. It can range from a) companies fraudulently charging above/below market prices among departments/subsidiaries in order to fraudulently lower tax liabilities in a particular jurisdiction, to b) companies retaining profits and associated capital in the foreign country that the profits were earned in. Most often, it refers to locating headquarters in a lower-tax jurisdiction regardless of whether the corporation has a substantial presence in that jurisdiction for its main area of business activity. The other questions are all very complex and can have extremely numerous caveats and/or special cases, etc. The questions are also prone to predictable divisions along ideological lines. However, here are some general points relating to each: 1) An empirical point of reference on the role of taxation in governmental capacity to address market imperfections: Somalia's tax-to-GDP ratio is about 10% (too low), while the tax-to-GDP ratio of the USA is above 30% (too high or too low?) and that of France approaches 50% (commonly viewed as too high). If all profits go overseas and are not taxed domestically, this could reduce the ability of government to correct market imperfections. 2) Does it add value elsewhere? Here you could enter into debates about what does it mean to "add value" (the most obvious assumption would be that you refer to "value added" as determined by monetary amounts representing value at different stages of production) or different views on "efficiency" (e.g., profit maximization of firms as compared to social welfare maximization in a society). I think you'd really have to get a handle on the main positions of the debate about those concepts, in addition to their most commonly used statistical indicators, in order to be sure of what exactly you're asking and/or want to ask. 3) Ignoring useful theories about things happening instantaneously and always equaling out in a way that is optimal across all uses: a) liquidity is needed both to undertake any investment opportunity that arises (including buying rivals for the purpose of enjoying monopoly profits or possibly for cost savings) and also to protect against liquidity shocks such as those related to a major fall in the value of capital assets across an economy (e.g., 2008-09); b) the case of holding a lot of cash should be compared to opportunities which exist for them to deploy liquidity to earn profit - for example, corporations should not be expected to engage in explicitly redistributive zero-value digging and filling of ditches (leaving specifically redistributive questions to the larger tax pool via government, which can more easily re-capture the value of human capital growth), and it is not desirable to "excessively" promote companies to deploy cash holdings in a pro-monopoly anti-competition manner. 

At a market equilibrium, marginal cost and marginal utility are equal. This does not mean that the cheaper good is preferred. Note that the US imports primarily higher quality steel at a higher price, and not lower quality steel at a lower price. Regarding the subquestion: As for how it could cause a trade war, this is probably related to a belief that if allies and trading partners do not commit to reciprocal measures, then more of the same unfriendliness will be delivered. For example, when the EU proposed a monetarily equivalent level of retaliatory tariff, Trump suggested he might enormously hike tariffs on EU automobiles. Otherwise stated, people don't like to be threatened, and might prefer to burn cash than to have the bully make off with their lunch money. In the meantime, it could be worth asking who'd like to see economic harm occur to Western countries, at their own hands (the context being one where China probably does not want to have tariffs on their steel exports or additional trade restrictions related to EU or Japanese responses). 

Compare a) A social planner who prefers the gains to go to one group instead of another, and b) A social planner who equally values a gain regardless of who got it. In terms of "inequality aversion", consider the specific mathematical definitions. The Gini index, for example, does not correct for whether the identities of the individuals are Mrs. Smith or Mr. Lee. 

Time is money When the average daily wage is 5 dollars, and many others survive on 1-2 dollars a day, it's worth it to many people to take a few minutes to try to get an extra nickel or dime out of the sale. Also, with high unemployment (especially in cities, since in rural areas there is the availability of subsistence farming as an alternative), the opportunity cost to taking time to negotiate can be zero. Another point worth mentioning is related to "repeated games". If you're visiting some place and will only ever buy one bottle of water from that person, they may rationally try to get the highest possible price. (This ignores that visitors may eventually be driven away from bringing money into the local economy ...). But if you live there (and ignoring that you would know what the market price was anyways, since you live there and all) then they will be less likely to try to take advantage of a buyer, because you might decide never to do business with that person again. 

Payroll taxes tend to have specific benefits accruing to the workers who pay them, and thus also benefit employers via impacts on labour supply. For example, there is a difference between taking a percentage from wages and having zero additional/marginal benefit to a worker (the case of income tax), as compared to taking the same percentage from wages and these amounts accruing to a personal account in a mandatory pooled pension managed by the government. Thus, even if it increases the cost of hiring someone for a given (hourly equivalent) wage, the aspect of specific benefits accruing to a specific worker will positively impact the ability to attract and retain talent. In the case of income taxes, the amount paid in taxes has no relation to benefits accruing to the workers who pay them, and hence there is no effect which would positively impact labour supply or demand in relation to an increase in income taxes (ignoring that it enables to fund activities which the market may underprovide). The above refers to the benefits side of the question, considering that the question pertains to incentives. The cost side of the question is extremely easy to calculate (ignoring questions of whether employer or employee ultimately face more of the cost), being some specific percentage of the paycheque. It is not implied that the overall cost of the mandatory pension amounts, employment insurance, injury insurance or others are, therefore, worth more or less to the employee than an equivalent cash amount, just for the fact of noting that there is a positive incentive involved. 

The people who do the planning explicitly account for 1) their cost of planning, 2) the cost of wages for transit operators, 3) the cost of infrastructure and 4) the cost of equipment (buses, etc.) ... etc. However, they might not account for the value of time or convenience to transit users. The value of time of transit users may be represented in some manner through the political process, but in the economic modelling it is easier to ignore this than to try to motivate a specific number (or series of numbers weighted across types of transit users) for use in modelling costs and benefits. One way to correct for this is to take surveys to try to find out how people value differences in commute times, although this may face legitimate disagreement about whether maximizing (for example) social welfare or production should be the primary objective in making use of such an estimation.
