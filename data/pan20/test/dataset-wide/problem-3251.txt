They used both. On coins often you can find the denomination in Greek, but the date in Roman numerals. As a general rule, all dates and day numbers were in Roman numerals. Also, it was customary for common accounts and ledgers to be kept in Roman numerals. Greek numbers were mostly used in literary contexts, like books on mathematics. 

This is a question about competing theories which are just that: speculative theories. So, I don't think there is any definitive answer here that is not a matter of opinion. The accounts of population are highly speculative and there is no way to know exactly how many people there at any given time. The claim by the Dutch explorer that the island had 2,000-3,000 people when he briefly visited in 1722 is shear guesswork on his part and cannot be considered a reliable census. Claims that the island had 15,000 people 200 years earlier are even more speculative. The "deforestation" theory is probably exaggerated. Palm trees are very finicky plants and even in places where they grow well, they tend to be sparse and grow slowly. The idea that the island was covered in giant palms that got wiped out by humans is not a logical theory. There may have been SOME giant palms, but the picture of some kind of tree disaster is probably highly exaggerated. Nevertheless, I think the "ecocide" theory has some validity to it. A human population will tend to put pressure on the resources of place. Not just trees, but birds, fish, edible plants, etc. So, in ancient times there was probably some kind of degredation of the local flora and fauna. How much effect this had on the population of the island is debatable because people will make do with what they have and turn to agriculture if wild sources become more scarce. All in all I would expect the island probably slowly increased in population over time (before European arrival) due to gradual improvements in fishing technique and agriculture. An important thing to note is that cultural effects can change population. If people simply want to have less children, than it occurs (just compare America today to 150 years when the average family had 5-10 children). This can cause large fluctuations in what would normally be a stable population over time. 

This kind of garment is generally called a surcoat. It is a sleeveless mantle that normally goes to the knees and is worn over a coat. A velvet surcoat, such as that being worn by Machiavelli in the painting is a specific type of surcoat which the Italians called a giornea. The giornea was typical of 14th and 15th century fashion in Florence. Note that the giornea took on different forms over the years so you can see very different examples of it. Women in Florence in particular sometimes wore heavily embroidered giorneas. Here is a painting by Botticelli of Giuliano Medici around 1480 wearing a very typical velvet giornea: 

The object in question is a blank spool of recording tape for a multiplex photographic recording system. Such systems were commonly used not only at Sayville, but at all transatlantic radio receiving stations. The way the systems worked is that a photographically sensitive tape was fed into a galvanometrically modulated exposer and then immediately developed, essentially making a picture of the Morse code dash-dot sequence received by the radio. This is what a developed tape looked like: 

They didn't. Your geography is a little off. As you can (sort of) see in TED's map Phoenicia is actually considerably north of Judea. Also, at the time of the Exodus, the empire of Tyre did not exist and the Phoenicians were a much smaller and less consequential people than they later became. Of far greater concern to the Hebrews were the Philistines and other Canaanite peoples. In Chapter 34 of Exodus, it reads: 

At that time the trade of the United States was primarily with Britain or the Spanish main. The English trade was conducted in pounds sterling and the Spanish trade in the Spanish milled dollar. Ultimately the dollar was selected as the U.S. standard of value. The merchants themselves would have dealt primarily in bank notes, but the banks eventually would settle imbalances in specie, usually in gold. In other words, what happens is this: (1) Liverpool cotton broker contracts to buy cotton from an American broker in New Orleans. The price will be quoted in pounds sterling on the Liverpool exchange. (2) The American broker will buy the cotton in Spanish dollars using a bill of credit drawn on an American bank. In other words the planter will get pieces of paper from the broker (bank notes). These notes are denominated in dollars. (3) The broker will now ship the cotton to Liverpool. (4) If the cotton arrives the Liverpool broker will sell it on the Liverpool exchange and receive pounds sterling drawn on an English bank. I.e., he will receive paper denominated in pounds sterling. At the same time he will send a draft to a correspondent bank in New York remitting to the New Orleans broker the agreed sum in pounds. (5) The New York bank will perform the exchange, taking the pounds and producing in return a sight draft in dollars. This sight draft is then sent to the New Orleans broker. He now has a credit in dollars drawn on a New York bank. He can use that money in New York, or have it forwarded to his bank in New Orleans. (6) Meanwhile, the New York bank has credit in pounds sterling and a debit in dollars. The bank accumulates all these debits and credits and consolidates them, so eventually they will have a single credit (or debit) in pounds sterling against a London bank (which will assume the debit from the Liverpool bank). (7) Ultimately this imbalance is resolved by the transhipment of gold. So, if the London bank owes the New York bank, say 5 million pounds sterling, then this amount will be converted to gold and the gold will be sent by packet ship to New York. And vice versa, if New York owes London, then it sends the gold. These settlements generally happened monthly. In this description I have simplified things because I have neglected freight and exchange discounts, which make the transaction much more complicated, but this is the essential skeleton of what happens. So, to answer your question, the merchants themselves deal in paper (drafts of various kinds) and eventually any residual imbalances are settled in gold by a few very large banks which consolidate the debits and credits of all of the traders and merchants. 

Unfortunately, none of the citations give any further information about this person and I can find no record in English or German bibliographies of a chronologist or medical statistician named Heckler. Does anybody know who this guy was? 

The Federal Republic of Central America was not a stable country because the area it contained was very difficult to rule in a unified way. This was for several reasons: 

A paper published soon after, "Limit on mass differences in the Weinberg model", by M. Veltman in Nuclear Physics B, Volume 123, Issue 1, 16 May 1977, uses the same term, but says "the so-called standard model". Thus, Veltman uses the term, but prefaces it by "so-called", indicating that the term was new and not universally accepted in 1977. By the next year, however, the term was on the way to being accepted. For example, in the review paper, "The geometry of generalized quantum logics" by TA Cook, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 1978. In this article it reads, "The first example we develop is the standard model of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics." In 1979, Sheldon L. Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, received the Nobel Prize for physics for their theory, but the commendation does not use the term "standard model." Nevertheless, at the time (1979), it was widely accepted to refer to their theory as the "standard model" of quantum particle physics.
