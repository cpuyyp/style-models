The question: Given my above-mentioned thoughts, and if I am offered a full time job, how should I say "Yes, I'm intertested. Please hold a spot for me, but I'm going to keep my eyes open for other jobs, as well." Maybe that last part isn't necessary... 

I am currently a senior in college in the job hunting phase. I have a rather significant online presence with an upcoming website, LinkedIn profile, StackOverflow Careers profile, etc... I also have an (shameless plug) impressive resume which almost always attracts attention whenever I distribute it. However, in an effort to always improve, is writing a Wikipedia article on myself a good idea, should someone look up my name? Would that be a good place to elaborate on details, awards, background, etc... which I would not normally put on a resume? Since Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, basically, people would more likely go there to actually read about me. This is not quite the same on a resume where real estate is precious, and on a profile website where less words and more pictures are what people expect. I understand the wiki-style editing of any entry on Wikipedia is open for anyone to edit, so that is something to consider. Thank you for your time. 

I am a senior in college and I've just landed a very coveted job interview with a well known company. I shared those details to paint a picture of how careful I want to be when handling this situation. I have been through the first interview with no problem, and it was during that interview that I scheduled when my second interview will take place. That was 3 weeks ago, and my second interview is in 1.5 weeks. The company was very clear about their desire to work with my schedule, since they are well versed with working with and hiring college seniors, given their tight schedules. This is the kind of interview which requires a lot of brushing-up of skills I already know in order to succeed. If I only prepare a little or not at all, I'm guaranteed to not do well. However, I had a very major academic project which came up, and is due the day before the interview. Given the large scale of this project, no matter how much I have worked, or will work on it, I can't both complete the project and put in the appropriate amount of brush-up time into the interview. The project's due-date is non-negotiable. The following week is very open for me and will provide the necessary time I will need to polish up my skills. I'm considering asking my recruiter if the interview could be moved to the following week. Given the situation, should I consider asking to reschedule this interview, and if so, how should I do it? I know my recruiter will not need the details of why, but do I risk coming into the interview not fully prepared or, perhaps, look as though I can't manage my time effectively? After all, this project did appear between now and the time we last spoke. What are your recommendations? Thank you. P.S.: If the name of the company would help anyone target their answers, I will edit my question to include it. 

My inclination is to go with #4, as it both signals to management that I am interested in skill-building while also indicating to them that I have, or may have, some skills that they may not be fully aware of and that I am also sensitive to using company resources wisely. This is not an IT employer and I am not in an IT role. 

I have found that many companies that offer or require internal training activities (e.g. "corporate training" "in-services", etc.) request that employees fill out forms rating and/or otherwise providing feedback on the quality, relevance, utility, etc. of the training. Several years ago, I had the "opportunity" to attend an internal training activity that was more or less a comedy of errors with malfunctioning equipment and an instructor that not only failed to prepare/set up for the class but lacked the competence and/or the motivation to actually deal with the problems. When this training ended, I duly gave a poor review on the official "anonymous" feedback form. Several days later, the instructor somehow found out and confronted me, telling me that I had violated an unwritten social rule that negative reviews were not allowed. To what extent is it acceptable to give poor reviews to internal corporate training? For example, are there different rules for when the problem is the instructor's fault (e.g. did nothing but read slides verbatim, sexually harassed students, showed up drunk, bad body odor, did not understand material, illiterate, etc.) versus when the problem is related to systemic issues in the company (e.g. lack of management buy-in, training budget too low to adequately teach material, lack of relevance of curriculum to job functions, broken air conditioner, etc.)? Edit: If it was not clear, I am asking about providing honest, good faith feedback to people who might not want to hear it, not about providing distorted or libelous feedback to antagonize or victimize someone. For example, this could be something like, "It's not professional to make me sit in a room with an instructor who smells like rancid butter and who thinks his job is limited to reading the slides, expecially when it is not clear how understanding how to safely store firearms will help me since employees here aren't allowed to carry them anyway. D-, Would not recommend this training to others." 

My workplace offers several training courses that are nominally optional, but that are being heavily marketed by HR as just what the doctor ordered in terms of shaping up our skills and giving us what it takes to shine in our jobs. I have looked at what is offered and determined that the courses offered are unlikely to be helpful to me as they are "basic skills" classes in subjects in which I have significant or extensive experience. For example, one of the courses is a basic course on how to use a computer, while I have extensive experience in IT and have been using computers for 30 years. I am a little worried that, by not enrolling in these courses, I am offending management (or HR) or limiting my career growth (e.g. maybe there are whispers in management saying "No, we can't promote @RobertColumbia, he hasn't taken the basic computer skills course, and all our non-entry level jobs require computer skills."). How can I determine to what extent I am expected to take these courses? I am interested in building my skills, but not very interested in spending time and company resources sitting in a class that is far below my level ("This is a mouse and you can click on it, yes yes, now let's all try it! Now, does anyone know what the Internet is?"), and possibly preventing a co-worker who actually needs the class from actually taking it because I enrolled in the last seat. Obvious options that I see: 

Every manager should expect to get some advice and direction from their experienced employees, that's a mild form "managing up" but there are some situations that I've seen that go beyond that: 

I think you have a valid concern, but that the benefits of putting relevant coding experience on your resume out-weigh the chance you'll have someone reading your resume that will count game playing against you. Violating a game's ToS is probably not something that is going to count against you unless you directly profited by that action. A tech guy that plays video games is not going to be a shock to anyone familiar with tech guys. I would describe your bot in user interface terms instead of gaming terms. Ex. Gamer = User, Game = Program, Navigate the Game = Navigate the Program's User Interface. This will eliminate anyone that is filtering resumes from removing you from consideration due to your gaming. If you get to the interview stage just make sure to keep the focus on the code and don't talk about the game more than you have to, avoid any in-game jargon. Evaluate how they respond and direct the conversation accordingly. If you can talk about it professionaly and not come off as a game-crazed geek you should be OK in most cases - good luck! 

Most bad managers I've seen were a mix of 2 and 3 and that seems to be what you are facing, everyone is different so I can only offer a few suggestions and leave it to you to judge and adapt: 

If nothing else this will make your chair easier to find again, but I think people will be less likely to grab your chair once it's obviously yours. 

New Manager - The employees have to train the manager and that puts them in charge for a litle while. Apathetic Manager - A manager that could do a better job and just doesn't so that the employees have to pick up the slack to keep their company / group running. Unskilled Manager - An ineffective manager doesn't focus on the right things may delegate real management to the employees I've seen this done intentionally and unintentionally. 

The chain of command has been bypassed, which is something a manager can do a lot easier than an employee, what I'm suggesting is that you act (to the best of your ability) like it hasn't and loop your boss in before (and probably after) the meeting with your boss's boss. 

Those may or may not dissuade future borrowing, but at least it will make it so you'll WANT people to steal your chair. I'd check for tacks before you sit down in case someone retaliates. 

You need to Influence, not impose. A ban is a BAD idea. Your employees are not children and you don't need to manage their eating habits. Are you willing to fire an employee or dock their pay (until they leave for a better job) for eating at their desk? Don't implement a rule you aren't really willing to enforce, no one will respect it or you. If you believe that this is the best policy then you need to be a leader and influence them to your point of view:
