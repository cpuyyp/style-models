Simply put, neither Julian nor Gregorian calendars have holes in their own dates. They have a point in time that is the same date for both. After that, the 2 calendars are in sync for some time, but later start to diverge. For any single day after the divergence, 2 different dates exist, one Julian and one Gregorian. Since only one of the dates is normally used in everyday life, switching between the calendars requires to change the current date non-continuously on the switch day, creating the gap in the numbering. The gap was 10 day initially, but some countries joined lately, and their gap is larger (13 days in Russia, for instance). On the switch, there was never any intent to synchronize the calendars at the switch date. The point was to synchronize the spring equinox to its traditional location on the calendar, stopping its drift accumulated over a millenia. So the gap was expected and allowed. For some time after the switch, people tended to use dates from both calendars simultaneously for same days (sometimes called "old style date" and "new style date"). Although the Gregorian dates weren't really used before its establishment, the calendar can be extrapolated back in time; it's called proleptic calendar. With this system, most days in history have dual dates, but in practice it only confuses everyone, so it's not normally used. Please note that the divergence between Julian and proleptic Gregorian is not actually at the year 1, so 0001-01-01 dates in the 2 calendars don't match. So the best way to date a day before 1582 would be to just use its Julian date. That's what people actually used then, and that's what was written in any historical document. 

Small hole and pressure led me to a thought... a cannister of compressed gas (soda syphon CO2 or a cycle emergency inflater CO2 or a soda-stream gas bottle) connected to a needle and release valve. Whack it in through some convenient place (temple?) and hit the gas release, taking the inside of the head up to considerably over-pressure. If the device is fragile the pressure shock may break it. The temperature shock of expanding highly compressed gas may also be enough to break it. If it isn't broken by that, the brain being driven out of any convenient apertures (ears? eyes?) and carrying the device with it would probably prove fatal to the device. I think it's fair to say that the person carrying the device in their head wouldn't survive the experience. You'd need to use CO2 or nitrogen or some other gas that had a high vapour pressure at ambient temperature... butane used like that would kill the person but wouldn't elevate the intra-cranial pressure that much. 

Does "interacting with civilisation" include (a) interacting with individuals in it, or (b) affecting individuals without "interacting" with them? Level 3 implies some extremely high level technical abilities, including changes specific to the immediate environment around each person. Perhaps distortion of electromagnetism - light we see, electrical impulses from our senses or in our neurology. Changes to the immediate environment of each person - changing the partial gas pressures to prevent respiration would be a neat one. So would transforming all food at the point of eating to remove key nutrients as they are ingested. Doing this for a few billion people over a few years (if not all at the same time) wouldn't be much of a challenge. I'm reminded of a SciFi comment whose source I cannot remember, that to prevent the rise of Hitler, all that would have been needed would to create sound waves of voices next to his ears, day and night, preventing concentration and disrupting purposeful behaviour, and consigning him fairly quickly to an asylum, suicide, or to behaviour that gets him ignored rather than followed. There are probably thousands of ways your aliens could do something similar to the environment people live in. Modify sperm cells before conception (not strictly "part" of a person), create distortions to vision calculated to cause fatal accidents, transform nutrients, transform the immediate atmosphere, tamper with human knowledge and communication to create harm directly or chaos, or to insert false harmful information into human knowledge, just name it. Imagination is the limit. 

Have no prevailing wind... such that for some part of the year it blows one way, for another part of the year it blows another way... For instance a mountain range that sits at around the line the jet stream would like to follow, fluctuations in the jet stream could mean that the side of the range that gets the rain would be changing on a irregular basis. If you consider somewhere like the UK, some of the time the wind comes from predominantly the west, but under the influence of waves in the jet stream low or high pressures get held over the UK and wind instead comes from the south or the north west. 

I think the implications of a telekinetic predator need more thinking through. Given that hunting strategy is generally some balance of "maximum effect for minimum risk and energy", I would expect that once telekinesis appears in a predatory species, it will be used eventually, not to trip animals up or pull them in. It would be used most effectively as an ambush hunting strategy. 

Quick answer - yes they'll go. Slow answer - can you imagine them still being a major means of digital interaction with whatever computers have reached in say, 300 years? I can't. A lot of the above answers seem to assume today's outlook - we are used to keyboards and they are useful for precision tasks. I think that, given another generation or so, especially one that takes better neural interaction in some form, for granted, and the effort and idea of typing letter by letter will be something quaint that only granddad's (and grandmums) do. 

In quantum mechanics, no true omniscience is possible, and all "practical approaches" to omniscience are inherently limited. Wavefunctions are fundamentally separated from observables, and only observables can be known by any observer, even by a god. There's an inherent behavior within the wavefunction that adds non-removable randomness to most observables. It cannot be suppressed or removed in any way without breaking the fundamentals of existence. So the whole situation could be like the Schr√∂dinger's cat to Chronos. He could literally not know the outcome until he observed the actual result. All his godly knowledge would be powerless to penetrate into the wavefunction, as it was not possible at all. He only could know probabilities of various outcomes, and had to take a bet, hoping for the best. Him being god of time would not help him in the slightest, as the passage of time can't remove indeterminism from quantum observations. Forcing a deterministic outcome would destroy all balance in the world, at the very least. 

Too open and depends on too much else. The answer to the direct question is "compete". The best example of animals with the same diet, is animals of the same species. They almost always compete, and often very intensely, which suggests different species with the same diet would, as well. But beyond that, it depends on so much else. Availability of food source. Nuances in when its eaten (high or low branches, as young or in mature forms...). Differences in hunting/eating behaviour (scavenging v hunting),... 

A lot depends on the air mix - very deep diving can involve helium instead of the usual gases, as the partial pressure of oxygen and other gases becomes critical. As this is a technical area, the best answer would depend on the gas mixture and the community's needs. These three wiki articles should help a lot with background and resources: $URL$ (Gaseous mixtures used for various depths and circumstances) $URL$ (Overview of breathing requirements and gas mixtures in the context of water depth, and how different depths are generally seen) This of course excludes any acclimatisation/adaptations that may occur, or (in the medium term) evolutionary changes, which may well occur too. $URL$ (May spark ideas by looking at how human biology has adapted in the communities that live permanently in the opposite environment) 

There's probably a more fundamental issue with this... as found by the mesopotamians (see for instance $URL$ - water is a good transport of soluble minerals that get left in the land when the water evaporates. Silt blocking the canals so they no longer feed water to the salt-poisoned lands would perhaps be a blessing... silt would certainly be one of the lesser worries in the long term. 500 cubic kilometers is 500 billion litres. Even 'insoluble' quartz at 6ppm (solubility of quartz in water at STP) is producing in the order of 3x10^^6 Kg (three thousand tonnes / tons) of quartz deposit per year at the fields... which would create chaos at the areas being irrigated. And flooding fields doesn't get rid of this... unless you can wash it into oceans. 

I admit up front, that my first reaction was to consider the comedy potential of this situation, as the device might have labels on it. That would make a big difference - think of the warnings on a bag of peanuts or a chainsaw, and enjoy imagination ("warning: this product may destroy large cities.", "user safety information: this product can cause cancers."). Leaving humour aside, more seriously, weapons designers tend to like avoiding stupid user errors from triggering nukes; maybe it would have clear descriptive labels sufficient to explained what it can do, if not how it does it. But as for your scenario, however interesting a plot it would make, the reality is that such a weapon is probably not going to do what you want, and is less useful than you thought, on so many levels. Starting with weapons design, nuclear weapons aren't just a blob of plutonium, they might have extreme precision shaped balanced charges (needed to ensure a hollow sphere fission device collapses perfectly symmetrically which is needed for fission, but which will deform or degrade after not very much time); an undamaged and somehow non-rusty very heavy steel container (to contain the initial blast for the fraction of a second needed to ensure it explodes and doesn't just fragment before significant fission); if plutonium was used it absorbs moisture from air and flakes apart, and if they used any isotope other than Pu-239 it has a relatively short half life in historical terms and will probably be effectively inert as a weapon by now (and other fissible materials may have lost enough through decay to no longer be viable); fusion devices may have materials like polystyrene which can degrade over time, and fragile precision parts calculated in ways they can't hope to intuit, and easy to damage or move even if the device is examined carefully. More seriously, all but the very simplest devices above all will have electronics or computerised control circuitry (to sequence detonation, detect correct impact, altitude, or other conditions met, authenticate the key/s used to authorise settings and activation) and are fail-safe design (designed to make it innately very hard or impossible to explode unless everything is just right) ... and therein lies a problem. Electronics could well degrade in mere decades, due to quantum effects. Metals lose their precision in a similar period, plastics change composition and become brittled, explosives in the trigger can lose their precision. There are questions on this site about how long a plane, or laptop, would work for, if "discovered"; the answers are usually "not that long historically speaking". Basically your nuke might be dangerous as a lump of toxic metal, but I'm dubious whether it would be capable of acting as a functional nuke. You might want to research nuclear weaponry shelf life. Moreover, even if it did, nukes are densely made - think what Ford does under a modern car bonnet, how tightly packed things are. Imagine what a nuke is like, very very densely built and much of it digitally controlled, probably inert unless triggered properly, electronics degraded and inert, no user keys or enabling procedures even if it could somehow work, and when opened, a tight tangled mess of incomprehensible wires and odd shaped materials and some very heavy metal - and those who touch it or inhale dust near it perhaps dying of toxic effects when their hands later wipe their mouth or touch food, even if they somehow don't get radiation poisoning just from being near it. I don't think they have a chance, or indeed that its plausible an old nuke could be identified as anything except a very heavy incomprehensible artifact of which everyone who has touched it dies in a horrible but unnatural manner. That's my best guess scenario. 

In terms of low-tech bakeries (typical medieval bakeries for instance) the oven would be internally fired to get it hot and the bread 'just' plopped down in free-form dollop shapes onto the oven floor. There's no expense of buying tins to bake in, there's no effort needed to clean the tins and no need to store tins for each type of loaf that is made. And if fashion changes and a 'new' shape loaf becomes fashionable then you'd need a whole new set of tins. Given the absence of cheap tin-plate, bread tins would be heavy, take a lot of heating up and therefore take a lot of heat out of the oven. When it comes to transporting bread... sacks don't pack hexagons much better than dollops. All in all, there's no benefit in making bulk bread in medieval times in tins. Also if you're using an artisanal flour with your own variety of yeast, the behaviour of the dough won;t be consistent. Making consistent loaves from inconsistent ingredients would be an extra overhead. Now if you accept uniform ingredients and cheap tin plate you can more easily make a hexagonal tin (a closed two-part tin with ends) and make a consistent hexagonal loaf. In the UK there's a loaf called 'milk roll' that is mould-made in this way... as a ribbed cylinder with flat ends. But it's dependent on knowing that an amount of bread will rise in a given time to fill the tin completely, that the oven temperature will be reliable and consistent across the loaves cooking at any time. It's a high-tech loaf rather than a low-tech loaf. If you want to consider authorities imposing dimensions on bread... consider the laws in France about dimensions and weights of baguettes. See for instance $URL$ that hints at the law. So it can be done, but not in hexagonal tins!
