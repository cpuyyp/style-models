I disagree with almost everyone's opinion here. If I'm the hiring manager and I need to choose between 2 candidates who are equally qualified, and one seems more enthusiastic than the other for the job, then there's no question I would go with the one who's checking in frequently. 

You have a personality You have enough confidence in yourself to stand out among the rest of the nerds in the bunch 

Though it doesn't matter now, next time you can try: Nancy, I am open to suggestions on how I can improve my communication with clients; however, this does not include being untruthful. 

If I am the hiring manager and I have a stack of 25 resumes, I would be most intrigued by you listing that skill. It shows: 

"Why did you leave that job?" "Oh, that was very sad. [Look sad.] My boss was very ill and he, he passed away. [Make a hand gesture meaning 'whatcha gonna do']." Few interviewers if any are going to have the stones to investigate the connections between his illness, your departure from the company, and his departure from this Earth. If pressed, tell the complete truth: "His disease was... of a psychological nature. He became increasing erratic, fired a number of us, and then took his own life. I suppose I could have asked his inheritors for the job back, but... it was just too much and I thought it better to move on." 

Is it your employer that is denying the leave, or just your manager? Whatever the legal situation, it's hard to imagine any employer seriously asking an employee to choose between his job and the use of his hand. If they wanted you gone, it seems like it would be safer to simply fire you rather than wade into the muddy waters surrounding FMLA, ADA, and whatever state regulations there may be. So I am thinking it is one neurotic or ill-trained manager in your chain of command. Consider discussing it with higher-ups, if such exist. Ideally, you want to inform the manager before going over his head, but you are about to lose this job anyway, so do it with or without his permission. 

The recruiter works for the company not you. Don't engage your management to keep the recruiter happy. They will almost certainly have an agreement where they will not put you forward unless you approached them directly. In this case that does not apply so it's highly unlikely you'll be able to use that recruiter without management approval. That would be seriously weird. The risk to you may or may not be great but it's real. Simply approach the company directly, via LinkedIn, or call up & find another recruiter that they deal with and approach them. Having a few preferred suppliers is pretty standard. I doubt this guy is your only way in. 

Sounds like a there's a pretty major gap in communications and knowledge of overall process flow. A simple, semi-casual get-together might fix that without too much angst. 

I am willing to bet this is not the first time management has had such a reaction to a client request, and that this has been a pattern. Their response should have been: Just like we trust you that you will pay us for our work, we can only work together if you trust us to follow through with our responsibilities. 

Bring it to their attention that this requirement was never mentioned in your employment agreement. If they tell you to go fly a kite, then you can expect more surprises from them because this will be a pattern. 

This is the key here. They broke the terms of their agreement with you. Here are the steps I think you should take: 

As your customer, I would be much more impressed with you showing me how comfortable you are telling me the truth. A real expert is someone who is focused in a certain area. If you were to tell me that you know a little bit of everything, that would be a clear statement that you are not an expert in anything. As for your boss, I'm sure this is not the first time she has had this kind of reaction. You won't change her. The market is HOT right now; get a better boss. 

You need to work that out with your manager. Firstly you need to come up with examples of where you've completed assignments too easily. Then work with your manager to explain that and, most importantly, solicit their opinion of how it went. You might find you done really well. You might also find that you missed something, left lose ends or some combination of good & improvable. This is the part where you really have to listen. If there are any areas to improve, make sure you do. If after doing that a few times, you and your manager should find yourself in agreement. From there it should be easier to find you a new home or new tasks within the same division depending on what's available. That would also be a good time to refer back to the job description and do a bit of a true-up of expected vs reality. It's rare for managers to turn down free resources if they think that person will contribute right away. Just make sure your opinion of your capability matches that of the manager and they should go into bat for you one way or another. 

Look at this picture? What do you see? That's right: whole lot of red flags. Do not take this job. Ignore the crappy salary. Ignore the passive-aggressive way HR conducts itself. Even ignore the general entitled mindset of "if you need a higher salary to work here, you don't appreciate what a God-given opportunity we are". Just realize that almost all of your future colleagues would have submitted themselves to the same degrading processes you are going through. Perhaps you are in some special circumstance that makes you more receptive to such a distasteful offer, but statistically, most of the other people weren't. They were mediocrities who didn't have a lot of other choices. Decline and, if you feel like it, send a letter to the CEO, saying politely that you would have liked to have worked there, but the unprofessional behavior of their HR department kept that from happening. 

Just gracefully resign and move on. Life's too short and 3 months is barely a probationary period where (in most non US countries) either party can decide the partnership is not right without making a big deal out of it. Also remember your CV/resume is a marketing document, not a legal factual record of your life. If there's truly nothing about this job that is transferable, just leave it off. Again, 3-4 months out of college gives you this opportunity. You have good reasons for leaving which you can make a reasonable case with. I'd not mention the issues with the company or the language though. Learn SQL as you go but don't sweat it too much. Look for jobs with skills you have + SQL and prove what you know when you have to. You're so fresh out of school you'll most likely only be considered for entry level jobs anyway where little actual experience is expected. It's not a big deal yet. This is one of the few times the decision will be so clear-cut (at least to people who are not you - that's hard sometimes). Go for it and move on with your life. Good luck!
