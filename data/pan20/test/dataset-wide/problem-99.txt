There are two scenarios to consider here: firing the gun while submerged, and firing the gun while it is just wet. Don't worry about making it possible for the gun to be fired while submerged. Bullets are made to fly through air, not water. The Mythbusters found a few feet of water can stop bullets even from high-powered rifles and that a fish tank can stop a shotgun blast (strictly one-time-use, though). So guns, while submerged, are only effective at point-blank range. What about the gun being wet? To reference Mythbusters again (because I can), they attempted to build a stun gun that could use water to conduct electricity to the target. They had a lot of difficulty doing so because it's quite hard to propel water in a continuous stream (it breaks up into lots of droplets). Given that your gun is using electricity to ignite the propellant, the firing chamber must be insulated from the grip. Thus, the only path for the current would be to go through the barrel, around the outside, and back to the grip. Now think about what a gun is going to be like when it's wet. It's not going to retain a layer of water all over the gun - most of the water will fall off, with some water sticking to bumps and crevices. This isn't going to be enough to conduct a small amount of electricity from inside the barrel of the gun all the way out to your hand. 

Another way to blockade a system would be to let the enormity of space do the blockading for you. As @Twelfth mentioned, if you have to rely entirely on slower-than-light engines it's going to take a long time to get anywhere. Additionally, if the civilization is accustomed to using FTL engines, they probably won't have many ships with strong sub-light engines. So how do we force them to use sub-light engines instead of their FTL engines? Use something like the interdiction field from the Star Wars EU. If space travel is common (and the existence of FTL drives makes that likely), then it's reasonable to assume that one of focuses of military research will be to impede FTL travel. A way to block FTL travel would make for a very effective blockade, especially if their interdiction range is pretty large (on the scale of 1 AU), and even more so if this is the first time that the interdiction technology is used. How it would play out: Enough ships show up in the system to blanket the system in interdiction fields. Each ship would have some escorts, but they wouldn't need too many. The ships would be designed to be self-sufficient for years at a time, and for the most part the escorts would be docked with it. In short, they'd be functioning like space stations for the duration of the blockade. If the interdiction technology was previously unknown, the blockade would have quite a while before they'd need to worry about any threats whatsoever. As I said earlier, existing ships would be set up to rely heavily on FTL engines. It would be reasonable to expect that the civilization being blockaded wouldn't even have ships capable of easily reaching the interdiction ships, so if they wanted to take down the blockade they'd have to build a new fleet designed to be able to reach them using only sub-light engines. Even a fleet able to reach an interdiction ship would be at a severe disadvantage. If the fleet is small enough to avoid detection, the escorts would be able to handle it. A large fleet would be at a severe tactical disadvantage - the interdiction ship will know well in advance that they are coming and be able to have a fleet of their own come in to counter them. The blockade's fleet would enter at some point through the interdiction blanket, having the interdiction ships temporarily turn off the fields while the fleet passed. The fields would also be arranged with overlaps in such a way that there would be a way to block the incoming enemy fleet while still allowing the friendly fleet to arrive unimpeded. So after months (and months) of slow travel to get to an interdiction ship, the enemy fleet will find that the friendly fleet has already arrived. Additionally, that friendly fleet will be fresh and will have been put together with a knowledge of what they'd be up against (so they could bring ships that would be most effective against the enemy fleet). What would they do about ships trying to take the slow route through the system? Not much. Thanks to the blockade, it will be much more costly for ships to enter or leave the system. It will be a long trip and any ship that attempts it knows that they will be watched the entire way. They have no way to know whether or not they'll make it through. In order to make it risky for people to attempt such runs, the blockaders need to catch some of them. A fleet could either be waiting for them near the edge of the interdiction blanket, or use the strategy I mentioned in order to show up deep inside the blanket. There is plenty of time for either strategy because of how long the trip will take without FTL. When they get caught, there are a number of things that could happen - if they resist capture they would probably be blown to smithereens, but if they don't resist they may have their ship seized for the duration of the blockade or just have their goods taken. Any fleet traveling through the interdiction blanket could count on a blockade fleet meeting them at some point during their journey. This goes for both incoming and outgoing fleets. To answer your two specific questions, the interdiction ships would be spread fairly evenly throughout the solar system to form a nice blanket. The number needed depends on the range of the interdiction fields. A sphere that extends to the orbit of Pluto (40 AU) has a volume of 64,000 AU^3, so if the interdiction field covers a 1 AU radius (resulting in a little over 4 AU^3 volume) you'd need about 16,000 ships to fully cover that sphere. However, without FTL you'd need gravity assists to leave the sphere, and you can only get those in the plane of the solar system. That gives an area of ~5026.55 AU^2 to cover, with each ship able to cover ~3.14 AU^2, giving full coverage with 1600 ships. I'd bump that up to 5000 to explain overlap and having some above and below the plane to ensure that they can't easily escape that way. If the coverage of a single field is a radius of 10 AU you get a 100x improvement in area coverage, allowing you to do it with 50 ships. 

In short, you need a gun capable of withstanding a point-blank nuclear blast and directing it entirely at whatever you're aiming at. (The propellant isn't the big news - the unobtainium, applied phlebotinum, handwavium, or whatever they're using to make these guns is.) Even then, you're still going to be obliterated by all the nuclear reactions set off by the gun with all the air between you and your target. 

In short, DNA doesn't work about 150 °C. So what would it take to prevent a creature's internal temperature for reaching that temperature? Very good insulation, and that would still only allow it to live in magma temporarily. There is no such thing as perfect insulation - a vacuum is close, but even then there's black body radiation causing some heat transfer. The higher the temperature something is, the more energy it will give off as black body radiation. Your creature wouldn't be able to use a vacuum anyway - the pressure it would need to resist would easily crush a vacuum unless the shell was made of handwavium. A sufficiently thick exoskeleton might be able to protect the creature, but that would be impractical because the thickness of the exoskeleton would render it immobile. So there's no way to protect the creature from the heat levels, and it can't have DNA at that heat level. You need something completely unlike all life that we know of. It's not going to evolve from anything with DNA - abandoning DNA and switching to something else would be completely losing 3.5 billion years of evolution. If it is possible, it would have to be a life form based on a molecular biology that we are currently unaware of. If you really want there to be something that lives in magma, you're going to have to handwave the explanation in one of two ways. The first is to have it be a life form that uses silicon (or some other element) as the fundamental element of its biochemistry instead of carbon. The second is to not attempt an explanation, which could be lamp-shaded by having someone say that they have no clue how in the world it is possible for such a thing to exist. In either case, no known biochemistry can fully explain how this could be possible. 

A staple of many games is the existence of random encounters - while traveling from point A to point B, the heroes are attack by bandits/wild animals/monsters/whatever. When defeated, the enemies will often have some kind of loot that the heroes can take with them. How would random encounters affect the socioeconomic development of society? For the purposes of this question, assume the following: 

So imagine this - a group of divers, where one has figured out a way to take air down with him. He goes down and is able to stay down for longer than anyone has ever stayed down before. However, as soon as he comes back up it's clear that something is wrong. He is clearly in pain, and gasping for air. As his friends watch, horrified, he passes out and starts turning blue even though he's still breathing. He soon dies, having suffocated due to lung damage. As they mourn their friend, they look at each other and understand - man was not meant to stay underwater for that long. (Still works if he only gets the bends) 

As the smoke doesn't dissipate, there's going to be a lot of these gases. Whenever there is rain, it's going to be acid rain. The heavier-than-air gases are going to pool in any low areas, so the valleys between peaks are going to be extremely toxic. However, you have magic in your world, so you can just lampshade this: 

In closing: Hopefully looking a little closer at one particular use of proteins helps you understand just how useful they are to life. It is possible that alien life could be built around an entirely different biochemistry, such as silicon-based life. However, no matter what biochemistry is used I would expect there to be some protein analogue—they wouldn't look like the proteins we see on Earth, but they would perform the same kinds of functions as our proteins do. 

This could work. As I just mentioned, black lights work by doing this. It's conceivable that you could have a more volcanic planet that tends to spew out some material into the atmosphere that blocks visible light but not UV light (with infrared optionally being let through as well). I don't know what compounds would be best at doing this. Of course, with most visible light being blocked, plants aren't going to be able to grow. Life on Earth has photosynthetic life at the bottom of almost every food chain. However, on a volcanic planet it's plausible to have a greater abundance of chemicals that can be used in chemosynthesis - using certain chemicals as the basis for energy needed for life instead of using sunlight. Also, any life that did develop would likely be incapable of seeing what we consider visible light - even with florescence, the amount of light that would be produced would be less than the available UV light. They'd be much more likely to either see infrared and/or UV. 

While John calls Colin, Edna continues looking for the intruder. After a minute, she sees an unknown man standing in the middle of the room with the Parthenon Marbles. 

Pressurized air. A balloon would allow the water to do the compression for you, but I don't know of medieval materials that can expand and contract as needed. If you don't have a balloon then you need A container strong enough to hold pressurized air. This is actually really important - the pressures involved would make most containers explode. A different mix of gases. Deep dives use heliox, a helium-oxygen mix, in order to get around nitrogen narcosis. FYI pure oxygen won't work, either. Something to make sure you get air at the right pressure. If your air is pressurized above the pressure of the water, you need something to make sure you don't burst your lungs when you breathe in. 

What would the world look like if we could detect the polarization of light? For one, we might be better at navigation: 

Any FTL drive that you choose to limit to STL I believe that you've correctly identified the main concern - in order to get somewhere fast, you have to go fast. That means you'll have a lot of kinetic energy, so if you don't hit the brakes you (and whatever you hit) are gonna have a bad time. All FTL drives somehow get around the problem of needing ridiculous amounts of energy to even get close to light speed. You just need to adapt them to your purposes and declare that it can't get you going faster than light. For example: 

This is what it takes to melt 1 inch of snow covering a 67m^2 area each second (clearing the path for a car going at 55mph). A strong blizzard can drop 2-4 inches of snow per hour, so consider a more moderate blizzard that drops 1 inch of snow per hour. That means this would be enough energy to keep an area of 0.24km^2 clear of snow if you're expending it constantly while the blizzard is on. Gunpowder has 3MJ/kg of energy, so you'd need about 200kg of gunpowder per second to get that much energy. Over the course of a 2 hour storm, you'd use up 1440 metric tons of gunpowder to keep a small portion of the area affected by the storm clear of snow. Additionally, the water is still there and we've done nothing about the wind. And that's assuming that somehow the gunpowder isn't getting wet from the storm, and that 100% of the energy released by the gunpowder goes toward melting the snow. Neither of those are actually reasonable assumptions. There is a lot more energy in a blizzard than you probably think. 

Currently, the only way we know how to do this without magic is antimatter. In general, the kinds of compounds you'll find in nature are very stable, which means it takes more energy to break them apart than they release. Living things do produce compounds that release energy when you break them apart, but the total mass of all living things on Earth is around one ten-billionth of the total mass of the Earth, so they are negligible compared to the Earth. This means that any attempt to chemically process an entire planet would consume more energy than it would produce, so your planet eater would be better off not eating the planet in the first place. If you use antimatter, you could potentially get around this issue because all matter can be fully converted into energy this way. Combining antimatter and matter creates gamma radiation, and it would be believable to have something like solar panels that collects gamma radiation instead of normal solar radiation. If you really don't want to use antimatter, you'll basically have to use a Clarke's third law variety of magic. I'd suggest something that can convert matter directly into energy without the use of antimatter. What it looks like and how it works is up to you because no such thing currently exists. 

This isn't going to work like you think. Think about a whirlpool versus a still pool: in a whirlpool the water pulls away from the center and moves to the edge of the pool. Saturn's rings are like a whirlpool already - by orbiting around the planet, the rings keep away from the center of the pool (the planet). If he tries to reverse the orbit of the rings, he has to stop them and then get them moving in the opposite direction. But what happens when they're stopped? They fall into the planet. So the rings will disappear all right, but not by flying off into space. 

In short - no blast, no heat, but lots of radiation. If your ships have very good radiation shielding (which would be very useful in space outside of combat, too) then only a direct hit or near miss is going to affect you. Non-nuclear weaponry will be even less effective - with no blast or heat transfer, a direct hit would be required for any damage to happen. As others have mentioned, it's pretty easy to come up with ways to disable long-range missiles, let alone simply causing them to miss. If a ship is close enough that a missile can't be disabled in time, it's likely that both ships would be affected by the radiation of nuclear weaponry. This also means that small fighters can be very useful - they would be very hard to hit directly with missiles. They would also be able to pretty much completely mitigate EMP damage - if an EMP missile is launched, electrical systems can be shut down into a mode that prevents any damage and then rebooted after the EMP has passed. These fighters would allow you to get missiles close enough to be deployed without being disabled before arrival. A salvo of missiles at close range is another potential tactic, though more risky - if you blow off a chunk of their ship it might come flying straight at your ship. A close-range salvo would probably use non-explosive missiles to avoid this - instead of trying to blow up the enemy ship, you'd be simply trying to punch holes in their hull.
