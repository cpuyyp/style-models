A semisimple braided category with duals is called modular when a certain matrix $S$ is invertible. The components $S_{AB}$ are indexed by (isomorphism classes of) simple objects of the category and one computes $S_{AB}$ by colouring the Hopf link with (representants of) $A$ and $B$ and evaluates the resulting diagram. One can show that a category is modular iff there are no "transparent" objects (objects that braid trivially with every other object) besides the monoidal unit. Is being modular a specific property, say in the category of braided categories? Is being a modular category equivalent to being the limit of some diagram or satisfying some diagram? 

Classical formulation Consider the (untwisted) Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant, defined for an oriented, connected, closed manifold $M$ and a finite group $G$: $$DW_G(M) := \lvert \operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M), G )\rvert $$ We're counting group homomorphisms from the fundamental group of the manifold to $G$. I am multiplying the more common definition by the size of the group, in order to simplify the following formulas. (Some are of the opinion that each homomorphism should be weighted by the inverse size of its automorphism group. I think this is not so, see e.g. this article. Instead, I think you can also sum over equivalence classes of $G$-bundles, which correspond to conjugacy classes of homeomorphisms, and there you need the weights.) Now this invariant satisfies a simple identity, where $\#$ denotes connected sum: $$DW_G(M_1 \# M_2) = \lvert \operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M_1 \# M_2), G )\rvert = \lvert \operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M_1) * \pi_1(M_2), G )\rvert = \lvert \operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M_1)) \rvert \cdot \lvert \operatorname{Hom} (\pi_1(M_2), G )\rvert = DW_G(M_1) \cdot DW_G(M_2) $$ The Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant is multiplicative under direct sum. We've used the free product of groups, denoted as $*$. We know from the Seifert-van-Kampen theorem that $\pi_1(M_1 \# M_2) = \pi_1(M_1) * \pi_1(M_2)$. Homotopy theory formulation We can also write the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant as the number of homotopy classes into the classifying space of $G$: $$DW_G(M) = \lvert [M, BG] \rvert$$ Indeed, instead of $BG$ we could insert any (sufficiently finite) homotopy 1-type. This calls for a generalisation, known as the Yetter invariant. An aside: The twisted invariant Let $[M]$ be the fundamental class of the oriented manifold $M$, $\omega \in H^{\operatorname{dim} M}(G, k^\times)$ a group cohomology element (with values in the unit group of a field) and $c\colon M \to B(\pi_1(M))$ the canonical map. Then the twisted Dijkgraaf-Witten invariant is defined as: $$DW_G^\omega(M) := \sum_{\phi\colon \pi_1(M) \to G} \langle \phi^*(\omega), c_*([M]) \rangle $$ The inner product $\langle - , - \rangle$ comes from Poincaré duality. It is easy to see that if $\omega$ is the trivial cocycle, the sum ranges over $1$, and we recover the original formula. Yetter invariant David Yetter, and then later Tim Porter, defined, for a homotopy 2-type $\mathcal{T}$, the following invariant: $$Y_\mathcal{T}(M) = \lvert [M, \mathcal{T}] \rvert$$ I think the original definition is more hands-on, in terms of crossed modules. Edit: I seem to have omitted the correct groupoid cardinalities here. See Arun Debray's answer further below for the correct version, or this article. Since there are some kinds of higher formulations of Seifert-van-Kampen (as discussed in this question) suitable for this situation, I'm asking the following question: Question: Is the Yetter invariant multiplicative under connected sum? I.e. does the following hold: $$Y_\mathcal{T}(M_1 \# M_2) = Y_\mathcal{T}(M_1) \cdot Y_\mathcal{T}(M_2)$$ 

No. You can even suppose the variables are all identically distributed, bounded and the covariances are all zero, and you still won't have convergence to a normal distribution. To see this, take my main example $(X_n)$ from here (for any fixed $N>1$), arrange it into a triangular array by letting $Y_{n,k} = X_k$, and then let $X_{n,k} = Y_{n,\pi_n(k)}$ where $\pi_n$ is a random permutation (with all permutations equally likely) of $1,...,n$. Since $Y_{n,1},...,Y_{n,n}$ is $N$-tuplewise independent, the variables in the randomly permuted row will still have zero covariance. And since the $(X_n)$ don't satisfy the CLT, neither will the $(X_{n,k})$. 

For subsets $A$ and $B$ of $[0,1)$, say $A\sim B$ iff $\lambda(A\Delta B)=0$ where $\lambda$ is Lebesgue measure. Question: How many equivalence classes of subsets of $[0,1)$ are there given AC? I would guess the answer is $2^c$ given AC, but I haven't got a proof. What got me thinking about this was trying to find a way to say that there are more nonmeasurable sets than measurable ones. There are, of course, $2^c$ of each, but modulo null sets there are only $c$ measurable ones (at least given AC), so if there were more than $c$ subsets modulo null sets, we could say that modulo null sets there are more nonmeasurable sets than measurable ones. 

Sorry! It was rather easy, so perhaps it should be closed. The second question clearly gets a negative. Let $\mu$ be a finitely additive measure on $\mathbb Z^+$ that assigns zero to all finite subsets. Let $n=1$. Let $f(k)=1/k$. Then $\int_{\mathbb Z^+} fd\mu =0$, but $0$ is not in the convex hull of the range. The first question gets a positive. It's clear for $n=1$. Suppose $n>1$ and it's true for smaller dimensions. Let $e=\int_\Omega fd\mu$. Let $C$ be the convex hull of the range of $f$. If $e\notin C$, there is a hyperplane $H$ through $e$ such that $C$ lies to one side of it. Let $p$ be a normal of $H$ such that $p\cdot f(x) \le p\cdot e$ for all $x\in\Omega$. Then $\int_\Omega (p\cdot f) d\mu = p\cdot e$ but $p\cdot f(x) \le p\cdot e$ for all $x$, so $p\cdot f = p\cdot e$ almost everywhere. We can modify $f$ without changing its range so as to ensure $p\cdot f = p\cdot e$ everywhere. But then the range of $f$ lies in the $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane $H$, and so by the $(n-1)$-dimensional case we have $e$ in the convex hull of the range of $f$. 

Let $M\colon \partial_- M \to \partial_+ M$ be an oriented, compact cobordism. Assume that there is a handle decomposition with at most one 0-handle, and denote the handle bodies by $M_i, i \in \{0,\dots 4\}$. It is known ("On attaching 3-handles to a 1-connected manifold" by Bruce Trace) that if $M$ is simply connected and $\partial_+ M$ is empty or connected, $M_4$ is essentially determined by $M_2$. Or put differently, $M$ is completely determined by $\partial_- M$, $\partial_+ M$ and $M_2$. What can we say for general $M$? Does the attaching map of a 3-handle contain nontrivial data? Are there Kirby diagrams with 3-handle attachments? (I've never seen 3-handles represented in Kirby diagrams, probably because in many cases, only their number matters.) 

If your TQFT does not extend to the circle, (EDIT: and you're willing to generalise to lax TQFTs,) then the answer is no. A reference is: $URL$ The proof goes by an explicit generators and relations presentation of the 3d cobordism category in terms of surgeries and automorphisms of surfaces. 

Since handle decompositions and Morse functions are intimately related, I'm imagining that a given explicit handle decomposition allows for an explicit description of the cellular complex and thus of (co)homology, which is directly isomorphic to Morse (co)homology. More precisely, the $k$-th grade of the complex is generated by the $k$-handles. It is known how to compute the cup product $\smile\,\colon H^i(M) \otimes H^j(M) \to H^{i+j}(M)$ for the Morse cohomology $H^*$ of a smooth manifold $M$. One has to chose two different Morse functions and study certain Y-shaped Morse flow lines. The cap product should be related. Is there a way to translate this to handle decompositions, i.e. an algorithm to compute the cap product $\frown\,\colon H^i(M) \otimes H_j(M) \to H_{j-i}(M)$ for given handle decompositions? In particular, how do you compute it for Kirby diagrams? Edit: As far as I understand, the reason why this isn't trivial is because the diagonal map $\Delta\colon M \to M \times M$ is used in the cup product: The first part of the cup product is a special case of the Künneth isomorphism $H^*(M) \otimes H^*(M) \cong H^*(M \times M)$, and then we pull back along the diagonal, $\Delta^*\colon H^*(M \times M) \to H^*(M)$. But the diagonal is not a cellular map, so it doesn't have a straightforward description in terms of handles. 

Is it consistent with ZFC that there is a subset of $[0,1]$ whose cardinality is less than that of the continuum but which has positive Lebesgue measure? Obviously not given CH. And, given ZFC, there is such a subset iff there is a subset of full measure that has cardinality less than that of the continuum. Moreover, I think it follows from the consistency of ZFC with the non-existence of Sierpinski subsets of $[0,1]^2$ that it is consistent with ZFC that there is a subset of $[0,1]$ whose cardinality is less than that of the continuum and which has positive outer Lebesgue measure. 

Here is a partial answer. The answer to the main question is negative given the continuum hypothesis (or more generally the non-existence of a real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to $\mathfrak c$). An extension $\mu$ of $P$ to all sets with property $H$ (even without any invariance properties) gives rise to an atomless probability measure $\nu$ on all subsets of $2^\omega$, the existence of which was shown to contradict the CH by Banach and Kuratowski. Here's how we get $\nu$. Given any subset $A$ of $2^\omega$, let $A^* = (\{ 0 \} \times A) \cup (\{ 1 \}\times (2^\omega\backslash A))$. This has property $H$. Thus, $\{ 0 \} \times A = A^* \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega)$ is $\mu$-measurable, and so we can define $\nu(A) = 2\mu(A \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega))$, which will be a probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$, and it will be atomless because $P$ is. (This uses Alex Kruckman's simple construction of sets satisfying $H$.) Given ZFC alone, one can give a negative answer to one of my follow-ups. Specifically, there is no extension of the product measure to all sets with property $H$ that is invariant under permutations of $\omega$, even if we just ask for finite additivity in the extension. For if $\mu$ is a finitely additive extension of $P$ to all sets with $H$, then $\nu$ (defined as above) will be a finitely additive probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$ invariant under permutations. A contradiction follows from the fact that $F_2$ is a subgroup of $S_\omega$. More precisely: Let $\langle Q_n \rangle_{n\in\omega}$ be a partition of $\omega$ into countably infinite subsets. Let $\phi_n$ be a bijection of $\omega$ with $Q_n$, and let $X$ be the subset of $2^\omega$ consisting of functions $f:\omega\to \{0,1\}$ such that $f\circ \phi_n \ne f\circ \phi_m$ if $n\ne m$. Then $P(X)=1$ (the probability of a repeat in a countable sequence of uniform i.i.d. random variables is zero). Now for any permutation $\pi$ of $\omega$, let $\pi^*$ be the permutation such that $\pi^*(\phi_n(m))=\pi^*(\phi_{\pi(n)}(m))$ for all $n$ and $m$. Note that $\pi^*[X]=X$. The permutations of the form $\pi^*$ form a subgroup $G$ of $S_\omega$ isomorphic to the full group, and $G$ has no non-trivial fixed points on $X$. Since $S_\omega$ contains a free group of rank 2, there is no finitely additive $G$-invariant probability measure on $X$ (here we use AC), which contradicts the fact that $\nu$ is such a measure. I still don't know: Can one prove a negative answer to the main question in ZFC alone? Can one prove a negative answer to the main question with $\rho_n$-invariance in ZFC alone? 

I have heard that one can do algebraic geometry internal to symmetric monoidal categories. Topological quantum field theories also exist internal to symmetric monoidal categories, and the usual definition is recovered by inserting the category of vector spaces. I wonder whether this can, or has, been done for noncommutative geometry. I'm interested in Connes' approach via spectral triples. I guess it is feasible to define what a $*$-algebra internal to a symmetric monoidal category is, but how does the story go on? Edit: As has been pointed out in the comments, this seems to hard in all generality. Let us restrict to finite-dimensional $*$-algebras and Hilbert spaces in order not to worry about topology and functional analysis. 

In my opinion, dagger categories are not evil, but they are not categories with extra structure (in the ordinary sense) either. (I think this is what Qiaochu Yuan meant in his comment.) More specifically, I wouldn't think of $\dagger$ as a functor. Let me give a comparison. In some parallel universe, people started to study "ategories", before they studied categories. Ategories are like categories, but without composition. That is, a small ategory $\mathcal{A}$ consists of a set of objects $\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$ and a set of morphisms $\operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A}$ with source and target maps $s, t\colon \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \to \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$. Now, suddenly people start to consider the composition of morphisms, $-\circ-\colon \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \times_{s,t} \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A} \to \operatorname{mor} \mathcal{A}$. And they demand that $g \circ f$ has the same source object like $f$, on the nose! How dare they, that's an evil concept! Maybe some other people try to find a weakened version of composition, but they fail, or their results are not as satisfying as they expected. The point is, that doesn't have to think of a category as an ategory with an extra piece of global structure. One should think of the morphisms as a set $\mathcal{A}(X,Y)$ for any two objects $X, Y \in \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$, and of the composition as a map $-\circ_{X,Y,Z}-\colon \mathcal{A}(Y,Z) \times \mathcal{A}(X,Y) \to \mathcal{A}(X,Z)$ for every triple of objects $X,Y,Z \in \operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}$. This comparison might be quite artificial, I admit. But let's try and translate the lesson to dagger structures. Definition: A small dagger category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of: 

Tarski's Theorem says that if $G$ acts on $X$ and $E$ is a non-$G$-paradoxical subset of $X$, then there is a finitely additive $G$-invariant measure $\mu:2^X\to[0,\infty]$ with $\mu(E)=1$. I am wondering if the following is known? Let $U$ be the set of all non-$G$-paradoxical subsets of $X$. Is there a function $\nu:2^X \times U\to[0,\infty]$ such that (a) $\nu(-,A)$ is a finitely additive measure, (b) $\nu(A,A)=1$, (c) $\nu(gB,hA)=\nu(B,A)$ for all $g,h$ in $G$, and (d) $\nu(A,B)\nu(B,C)=\nu(A,C)$ whenever the left-hand-side is defined (i.e., isn't zero times infinity)? (We could call $\nu$ a relative probability. Cf. this.) I suspect Wagon's proof of Tarski's Theorem can be extended to prove this, but I don't want to go to the trouble of going through all the details if it's in the literature. 

The probabilistic reasoning depends on a conglomerability assumption, namely that given a fixed sequence $\vec u$, the probability of guessing correctly is $(n-1)/n$, then for a randomly selected sequence, the probability of guessing correctly is $(n-1)/n$. But we have no reason to think the event of guessing correctly is measurable with respect to the probability measure induced by the random choice of sequence and index $i$, and we have no reason to think that the conglomerability assumption is appropriate. A quick way to see that the conglomerability assumption is going to be dubious is to consider the analogy of the Brown-Freiling argument against the Continuum Hypothesis (see here for a discussion). Assume CH. Let $\prec$ be a well-order of $[0,1]$. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are i.i.d. uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Consider the question of which variable is bigger. Fix a value $y\in [0,1]$ for $Y$. Then $P(X\preceq y)=0$, since there are only countably many points $\prec$-prior to $y$. By a conglomerability assumption, we could then conclude that $P(X\le Y)=0$, which would be absurd as the same reasoning would also show that $P(Y\le X)=0$. The argument fallaciously assumes conglomerability. We are neither justified in concluding that $P(X\le Y)=0$, nor that $\{ X \le Y \}$ is measurable (though for each fixed $y$, $\{ X \le y \}$ is measurable). And indeed it's not measurable: for were it measurable, we could use Fubini to conclude that it has null probability. Note that one can repeat the argument without CH but instead using an extension of Lebesgue measure that assigns null probability to every subset of cardinality $<\mathfrak c$, so clearly there is no refutation of CH here. Here's another analogy: By the Hausdorff Paradox, decompose $S^2-D$ for a countable $D$ into disjoint $A_1,A_2,A_3$, where $A_1,A_2,A_3,A_1\cup A_2$ are all isometrically equivalent. Suppose a point $X$ is uniformly chosen in $S^2$. (I will ignore $D$ from now on, since it has zero measure. If you like, you can assume that the uniform choice is done so $X$ cannot lie in $D$.) Let $i$ be a random index in $\{1,2,3\}$, independent of $X$. How likely is it that the $X \in A_i$? It's very tempting to say that it's got to be $1/3$. Any fixed value of $X$ in $S^2$ is in one of the three subsets, after all, and so if we choose a random index $i$, surely we have probability $1/3$ that it'll be in $A_i$. Of course this easily leads to paradox. But we are not in fact entitled to assume that $J = \{ \omega : X(\omega) \in A_{i(\omega)} \}$ is measurable. (In fact, it's easy to see that it's not measurable.) Let's go back to the riddle. Suppose $\vec u$ is chosen randomly. The most natural option is that it is a nontrivial i.i.d. sequence $(u_k)$, independent of the random index $i$ which is uniformly distributed over $[100]=\{0,...,99\}$. In general, $M_j$ will be nonmeasurable (one can prove this in at least some cases). We likewise have no reason to think that $M$ is measurable. But without measurability, we can't make sense of talk of the probability that the guess will be correct. Here's an amusing thing that may help see how measurability enters into these things. Consider a single sequence of infinitely many independent fair coin flips. Our state space is $\Omega=\{0,1\}^{\mathbb N}$, corresponding to an infinite sequence $(X_i)_{i=0}^\infty$ of i.i.d.r.v.s with $P(X_i=1)=P(X_i=0)=1/2$. Start with $P$ being the completion of the natural product measure on $\Omega$. Can you guess the first coin flip on the basis of all the others? You might think: "Of course not! No matter what function from the values of flips $X_1,X_2,...$ to $\{0,1\}$ is chosen, the probability that the value of the function equals $X_0$ is going to be $1/2$." That's a fine argument assuming the function is measurable. But what if it's not? Here is a strategy: Check if $X_1,X_2,...$ fit with the relevant representative. If so, then guess according to the representative. If not, then guess $\pi$. (Yes, I realize that $\pi\notin\{0,1\}$.) Intuitively this seems a really dumb strategy. After all, we're surely unlikely to luck out and get $X_1,X_2,...$ to fit with the representative, and even if they do, the chance that $X_0$ will match it, given the rest of the sequence, seems to be only $1/2$. But if you choose shift-invariant representatives (i.e., $r([\tau \vec u])=\tau r([\vec u])$ when $(\tau\vec u)_n = \omega$ is a left sequence shift--by Zorn, such a choice is possible), then the outer $P$-measure of the set of representatives is equal to $1$. So there is an extension $P'$ of $P$ such that $P'$-almost surely the dumb strategy works. Just let $P'$ be an extension on which the set of representatives has measure $1$ and note that the dumb strategy works on the set of representatives. 

In this article, Joyce defines a new kind of smooth map of manifolds with corners. The standard requirement would be that a smooth map is smooth in every chart. He calls such maps weakly smooth. In order for a map to be smooth, he requires it to preserve something he calls "boundary defining functions", which look a bit like local Morse functions to me. This additional requirement seems to have a few drawbacks, namely several basic functions aren't smooth anymore, such as $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty), x \mapsto x^2$. He lists a lot of examples for smooth functions, e.g. compositions of smooth functions, products, the boundary inclusion, the diagonal map. His category of manifolds with corners and smooth functions has initial and terminal objects, and pullbacks for transversal maps. His diffeomorphisms are exactly homeomorphisms that preserve the maximal atlas. Which of these features are lost when removing his additional requirement? What doesn't work for the naïve definition, in his words, of "weakly smooth maps"? 

I've heard that Reshetikhin-Turaev (RT) is stronger than homotopy, and it can distinguish certain homotopy-equivalent, but non-homeomorphic Lens spaces (I think $L(7,1)$ and $L(7,2)$). Now the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury (TVBW) invariant for a spherical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ is the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant for $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$, which is a restriction, so in principle, RT could be stronger than TVBW. Are there calculations that show explicitly how TVBW is stronger than homotopy? What category do you have to use to achieve this? Otherwise, I'm very happy to hear expert opinions stating that this is an open problem. 

(All this can of course be described abstractly and beautifully with Kan extensions.) I'm wondering whether there is a higher categorical version of this, possibly involving orientals. While every usual simplex $[n]$ is just a category, and its nerve is therefore a 1-skeleton, the $n$-th oriental $\mathcal{O}_n$ is an $n$-category. For example, $\mathcal{O}_2$ has the same objects and 1-morphisms as $[2]$, but it also has a nontrivial $2$-morphism representing the area of the triangle. I'm looking for the following kind of construction:
