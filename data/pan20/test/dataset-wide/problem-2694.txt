(too long for a comment) The logic in your second paragraph misses the point. Assume "I believe that ripe bananas are yellow". It is a properly basic belief that "I hold that 'I believe that ripe bananas are yellow'". Note the second level of indirection. The sensation of believing something just comes to oneself as a subjective experience. Since this "sensation of believing" is a subjective, internal experience, it is (or at least appears to be) on the same kind of footing as having as other internal, subjective experiences, e.g. perceptual ones. Whether or not there are bananas out there in the world that aren't yellow when ripe doesn't change the fact that, in my current mental state, it is true that "I believe that ripe bananas are yellow".

The transition from the common use of "materialism" to "physicalism" represents a recognition that the boundaries of the former are too narrow to accommodate what is now accepted about the nature of the world. I don't see a good reason to think that it is impossible that we cannot have a similar transition from physicalism to some x-alism if we were to conclude that there are some non-physical things that are none the less real (I don't know of any such things, but 17th century scientists/philosophers didn't now about quantum fields either). Materialism, especially when differentiated from physicalism, tends to connote the idea that all that there is is matter moving around. Nowadays we consider various kinds of non-matter stuff -- energy, momentum, quantum fields... as being real. These non-material things are sufficiently different from (the conception of) "matter" as used by the early materialists and thus a new term is required. I can't rule out the possibility that in the future there will be some other kind of stuff, sufficiently different from what we currently accept lives under the term physical, that we'll again need to construct a new category. Of course I can't imagine what such stuff would be. Just poking around on the web I've found the mathematical universe hypothesis by Max Tegmark -- which has in it the idea that mathematics is "really real". If that hypothesis were to pan out, then one might reasonably say that physcialism missed the mark. There are probably other ways that one could immesh the laws of physics, or even mathematics itself, in with the the structure of the universe such that it would not be precise to describe these ontologies as being strictly physical. 

Embryos are a stage in development of human organisms. To phrase the issue concisely: If something is X at the end of a time interval, then either it must become X during that interval, or else it must have been X from the start. Therefore, becoming X requires a distinct change - "person" is a binary distinction. There are no "half-person" or "3/7ths person" as valid options. But physiologically, genetically, biochemically, anatomically - all development is gradual. (Look at the above link and see how slowly we change - and remember that these are a small number of stop-motion frames over 9 months of gradual development in gestation.) After the formation of the zygote, there are strong scientific arguments that no single defining moment of change in the development from zygote through adult senescence is significant enough of a change to demarcate a change in status to toggle from "not a human life" to "human life." Nor from "not a person" to "is a person." (Even birth is a process of several hours to several days, and a journey of almost 2 feet. At what moment is it a human life or a person? Out with cord cut? Without it cut? Only head out? Cervix dilated?) Cognition is also a very gradual development that can vary widely between individuals. Discussions on this have very diverse opinions. I argue that if one cannot define criteria for a toggle point, there cannot be a solid argument for any point. Therefore, if no toggle point can be established, it defaults to the beginning of the line - the first point of formation of that particular human organism. Otherwise we are stuck in vagueness, ambiguity -- but this is a situation where there absolutely must be a definition; lacking a clear definition of "life" or "person" results in dangerous inconsistencies in discussions on policy, bioethics, and legality. 

Can we say that no matter what philosophy a person holds, ultimately, all humans use double standards to live? The reason is: all continuously living human beings, will prefer to eat other living things, and not want to be eaten by other living things. Because if there is any human that is not using this way of thinking, and not eat other living things (plants, or animals), he or she will not live past a few days or weeks. Or can we say that no matter what philosophy a person holds, it needs to break down sometimes, because, ultimately, all humans use double standards in order to live? Unless, if the philosophy itself already include this double standard element in it. 

Say, we we take and the opposite of , like is going to the right on the x-axis, while is going to the left of the x-axis, everything is fine so far. Now note they are opposite, and one is taken to be positive, and one is taken to be negative, just like Yin and Yang. But what if it is and as the Yin and Yang? Consider , it gives you , or , it also gives you , but what about ? Why doesn't it gives you the symmetry of giving you ? The same with . Why doesn't it give you ? That is, if and are just in two different directions, then, say, you put the chart on the table. The person sitting across the table, will now see the as , and see as . So to me, if can get the opposite: the , why can't get the opposite: the ? Because to the person sitting across me at the table, my is his . This may explain it more: if you say should give , then why will not give ? Because if I stand facing north, versus a person facing south, then my is his . Then my giving , to him, is , giving , but to me, it is giving (just like is . So why it is not symmetric? I suppose one easy argument may be, because is to "negate" something and therefore and are different, but this doesn't explain, what about and ? Then how can we define what is the ? What I see going left, the other person sees it as right, so if left is negate, then he will say, no, the direction you are pointing at, is "right" and it is not negate. If I say, ( ) will give the opposite (), and he will say, no, ( ) WILL NOT give the opposite. Why is that? P.S. I am asking this question because if math is one way of describing properties in the universe, then we hold it true and accurate that gives a , but gives a . On the other hand, we have a philosophy that you can name one direction one thing, be it left or right, left can be right if another person sees it at a different angle, and we can name one direction as positive or name it as negative, and if you were to do calculations, everything still work as expected. So if these two philosophies, or ideas, or notions are true and accurate, why do they seem to contradict each other? (because if you name it , then will give you . But if you name it , then will give you . Supposedly, how you name it shouldn't matter.) 

Science is a method. The scientific method gives us tools to hypothesize and theorize models to fit what we currently observe about our universe. Science is not an absolute truth; our body of scientific knowledge is a collection of the best models we currently have. Many models are extremely strong, some are works in progress, and some are just starting to develop. We don't yet have models to fit absolutely everything that we observe, and there are also many things that we have not yet observed, could never observe directly, or have not yet even contemplated. We are inside of a complex system, doing our best to make models that explain the system. Physics is the primary tool that we use to explore models for the mechanics of the universe. We use our current theoretical models of the universe and extrapolate backwards in order to hypothesize what came before what we currently observe. The strongest theory I have ever read for the initial inciting force is the necessity for the existence of an "unmoved mover" (also called "prime mover"). It is philosophy that illuminated the unmoved mover. I would recommend reading about it. I will try to find a better link that Wikipedia, but it is a great start. Nothing from astrophysicists that I have read has presented a convincing-enough argument for what comes before the Big Bang. Many refer to a singularity, but the force that initiated the expansion of the universe has not been successfully modeled. This suggests that it is indeed philosophy that so far has been capable of going beyond the current scientific models proposed. (I consider religion as being an aspect of philosophy.) There are various proposed scenarios for the very early universe, most of which differ radically from one another. A discussion of some of them can be found in the Wikipedia entry on the Chronology of the Universe:
