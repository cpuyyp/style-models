Just doing the math shows that squatting 3 times a week and increasing the weight by 5lb each session shows you can increase your squat from 45lb(standard olympic barbell) to 225lb in theoretically 12 weeks or 3 months(hopefully I did that math right), and yes, it is possible. 225lb is a lot of weight to be moving especially if you've never squatted in your life. Focusing on stuff like this is an easy way to keep your progress moving forward instead of, as I said, being fixated on appearances. Let the strength and technique come first and the appearance will follow. I hope this helps you. 

I'm 23 and god only knows how this could've happened. It could either be from the other day when I got trigger happy and evacuated my bowels quickly(I wasn't bearing down hard I just push it all out relatively quickly and with ease)or from squatting and deadlifting. I've been doing stronglifts 5x5 for a few months and had some trouble making gains until I really started to push myself. I'm afraid that the extra exertion I've been putting into my lifts has played a role in the formation of this. But should I continue to lift tomorrow? I want to say that I put a lot of pressure in my ass as I exert the force on the squat, because everyone always says to squeeze your glutes. Could that have been the cause? My lifting stats really aren't even that high: OHP: 100 Squat: 225 DL: 225 BP: 180 Rows: 100 

Calories in/calories out relates very well to the first law of thermodynamics. You consume calories, but they're never created or destroyed, they can only change forms. If you don't use that energy when its available, it gets stored as fat. At other times, it converts into the heat that each of our bodies give off. Think TDEE, or total daily energy expenditure. Your body needs energy to do the things it needs to survive and the main product is survival; a byproduct is heat. The thing about eating over maintenance and not actually gaining muscular weight is that you're not using glycogen stored in your muscle for contractile force. When your bloodstream has too much glucose floating around in it from excess energy(macronutrients)is when it gets stored as fat. I highly doubt that there are any studies showing a positive correlation between untrained individuals that are highly overweight having excessive amounts of strength compared to leaner/trained individuals. But that's just my opinion. 

To answer your question specifically: it doesn't matter. Studies show that the average amount of protein taken in over a given period of time(days, weeks)is what matters far more than getting your whey in before or after. The body does not really become magically more efficient at using protein after a workout. As long as you're hitting your daily intake spread out amongst reasonable servings(instead of trying to consume 80g of protein all at once)each day you'll be fine. Remember the 80/20 rule. 80% of the results actually come from 20% of the things that matter. The 1 hour post workout window is actually a thinly substantiated myth. If you ACTUALLY want to focus on getting your protein in after a work out then just make sure you get it in at some point in the following 24 hours. I'm not kidding: $URL$ Another good reason dispelling some myths: $URL$ 

This is a similar issue concerning the whole simple vs complex carb myth. Typically foods that have a high glycemic index have a relatively low to zero fat content which causes your body to digest high GI foods faster. 

After doing much extensive reading and self learning I've always been under the assumption that the only things that can genuinely give you "energy" are macro nutrients since the body can utilize them for energy through the process of gluconeogenesis. And I know that creatine provides a little bit of extra oomph by sparing ATP when you're used up all your stores for the moment. But what exactly do more pre workouts do that provide energy? A lot of the time people associate words like "buzz" and "jittery" with them, increased body temperature, among other things. But most of the time there really aren't any direct compounds in them that are responsible for giving you USABLE energy. If I had to guess I'd say the primary actor in most pre workout energy powders are psychoactive stimulants(such as caffeine and taurine) with dosages multiplied to exponential amounts combined with current trending blends of "bodybuilding cocktails" e.g. BCAA's, in essence giving consumers a greatly increased feeling of anxiety. Anxiety in the sense of "I feel like I ought to do something" but greatly amplified. So what do you guys think? 

Malnutrition happen even if your calorie count is right if you don't eat all the things you need, and malnutrition will not only make you prone to storing more fat, it'll make you ill. 

Don't buy things to binge, shop for your daily needs every day if you must. Pointers on coming back to eating from heavy starvation Setting your psychological issues aside, when you have been starving yourself it is a natural reaction to binge and "fill up the reserves". Even if you eat normally for a +-0 effect on your weight, you will still gain weight. You have to accept that fact and wait it out. After about a month you can on top of eating normally begin to do some kind of exercise for at least 30 min/day. You need to increase the exercise, not decrease the food intake if you eat normally. Taking your psychological issues into account, you have to remember that it's not the end of the world when you have an episode. Just keep at your dietary plan and exercise routine and remember to praise yourself whenever you resist temptation or just for being strong enough to have gone another day without binging. You can't make excuses for yourself, but you can praise yourself for what you do well. General tips to conquer the "huger" 

Starvation may seem to work since you lose weight fast, but as you've also begun to realize, it does damage to your body. Not only will you eat the fats under your skin; you will eat the fats in your brain. It makes you malnourished as there are a lot of nutrients we can't store and need to consume daily, and when you finally do start eating, your body will store everything it can to not die when that starvation happens again. (Your body is assuming it will). 

The long answer Burning calories is very individual and one's metabolism can't be guessed by those sites. Heart-rate does give a somewhat good indication of how hard you're working out, but it still doesn't tell us how your metabolism actually work. Why GPS and Maps may be bad First and foremost; GPS is not very accurate and thus the route can be very different from what you actually run (the more expensive the GPS the more accurate the result) and the GPS doesn't know if you're running on a flat, inclined or declined surface. You could run up a mountain and the GPS wouldn't know. Maps may also be the same as the GPS on the point that it may not account for the hills, and the distance can thus also be distorted, though it is my opinion that maps are more accurate than GPS. Why heart-rate monitoring is good You could run X km in XX time, but depending on your level of fitness, you will work differently hard and burn differently many calories. Tracking your heart-rate as far as I know the best way of measuring how much you're burning since it measures how intensely you're working out. You can then make an assumption based on the average person and perhaps modify the calorie count according to your metabolism. If you have a fast one you may wanna add a few calories and subtract a few from the norm if your metabolism is slow. 

The short answer Neither site is very reliable for how many calories you actually burned since none tracks your heart rate and their methods of measuring distance are not necessarily reliable. You will have to guess based on how hard you felt you worked out. It's probably closer to what runkeeper gave you, if I were to guess without knowing your level of fitness. 

My dear friend, it sounds like you are suffering from bulimia. Even if you are not, you will need to steer up your mind. Breaking habits require a lot of self discipline, which will be near impossible when you're already weak from your other psychological issues. This is not criticism, it's just how things are, and when the mind isn't well, neither is the body, and a body that isn't well won't function as it should. You should look into a dieting program that involves mental training; where they help you build yourself and deal with why you're so weak to food. There are a lot of small tips to treat hunger or "hunger" as it isn't actual hunger you feel when you've already eaten yet still crave more, but they will be useless if you don't have the mental strength, which is why I recommend one of those dieting programs with mental training. 

If you want to get better at a particular exercise you'll just have to continue practicing it. This is a common colloquialism when people ask "how can I improve my bench press?". More advanced lifters will say "bench more". If you want to increase shoulder strength you're going to need to find the deficiency in your form or nutrition to help you overcome it or you just need to practice it more. There could be other factors involved such as your recovery, the sleep you are or are not getting, alcohol consumption, etc. When you're overhead pressing you don't want to rotate your wrists too far back. You should be keeping your knees locked because if you don't you'll find that you have a tendency to perform what is actually called a push pres which takes work away from your shoulders. A good tip for performing the overhead press is to squeeze your shoulder blades and lats back together as hard as you can and bring your elbows in front of the bar a little more. This gives you a more stable platform to push off from. Your entire body needs to be tight as well. I don't think you would get much benefit by performing accessory exercises on the lats or triceps (if you're not already doing them, that is) that would translate over to the OHP. It's just something you're going to need to work at. Keep in mind the OHP tends to be explosive but do not let momentum take over. You should be bringing the bar back down below your chin to the point that you're having to pivot your head back and forth each time it travels up and down to clear the bar. The area where the bar returns to is typically referred to as your shelf. Here is a good video illustrating form: $URL$ 

Generally what's known scientifically is that before or after a workout, your body can't differentiate between such states where it somehow arbitrarily "needs" something and can utilize it better just because it's in this mythical state. e.g.1 your body thinks it can somehow better utilize the protein it gets right after a workout e.g.2 this guy just worked out and now his body "thinks" it's in a state where it "requires" a post workout shake to get gains. This is really just a myth and has no scientific grounding. What most modern studies have indicated is that the post/preworkout craze is really just that, a craze conceived from "bro-science", and, that it's actually the average protein intake over a given period of time that really has the most impact on things like recovery, strength gains, hypertrophy, etc. 

Whenever I do exercises like hanging leg raises or cable crunches, or just generally any crunch or ab exercise, I don't really feel like I'm getting any good abdominal/core activation and so after I've done 3 sets I just feel like I wasted energy since I don't really feel anything in my abs. I get different activation in my core when I'm doing the compound lifts like deadlift, squat, bench, and ohp. I take a moderate breath of air in, not too much, and can feel my core braced and tight to keep everything stable, but this is about all I really feel. I feel like my sitting and standard posture is excellent already and I mention that because I've read that if you force yourself to have good posture then your core will support it. Well my posture is fine I just can't really seem to activate or contract my abs that well during normal exercises. Any tips or advice? 

Unless you drink enough cans to put you in a ~3500 calorie surplus over the span of a few days you won't gain fat weight. It's really the poor dieting habits that people who drink diet sodas still undertake that causes them to continue to gain or not lose weight, rather than the drink itself. This is referred to as the "big mac and diet coke" phenomenon. With that said, it doesn't mean that diet soda is any better off as a drink that you would want to consume or should feel safe consuming. It's still just as highly processed and packed with chemicals the body doesn't need, doesn't want, and chemicals that can cause health issues. $URL$
