Bonus however of the fact that the crayfish licence is free currently. For the traps you must follow the guidelines set out by Gov. 

I've often read and been told that with foraging less is often more. Whilst you may need X kilograms of a berry or flowers (like elderflowers) you should never pick a bush clean. How can you estimate when to move on to the next bush, or not pick at all, would it be like leave at least half? What's the reason to leave an amount on the bush? 

From a scuba diving / apnea (free) diving perspective knowing your barometric pressure can let you know your depth - At 1 bar you are at surface level, with each 10m descent you are at a further 1bar. So at 10m you're at 2bar. At 15m you're at 2.5 Bar etc. There are many risks with being underwater from a scuba perspective which increase with depth. From as little a depth as 5m you can become (depending on you as an individual) susceptible to the effects of nitrogen - as you breathe in and out under water your body takes in more nitrogen than you do at the surface, this again varies on you as an individual (fat absorbs more nitrogen etc). Apnea divers tend to not be affected as they hold a continuous breath. Nitrogen narcosis can cause a lot of problems, from becoming incredibly slow in responding to hallucinating. Also with scuba you must continue to breathe, holding your breath can lead to a lot of issues. With depth, and therefore pressure increases, your lungs volume changes, so if you imagine a balloon full of air at the surface, at 40m the balloon will be 1/4 the size but hold the same amount of air. Now imagine you fill that balloon further whilst under water, and then coming up - the balloon will burst as the air expands coming up. This is exactly why divers can never hold their breath, and why you may get a poke in the stomach from your buddy if they don't see bubbles. This is commonly recorded on your dive computer though, but some people dive with a watch as well, as a fail-safe. 

He thinks it should retain the waterproofness but bear in mind it might pick up leaves etc more as the fibers will be softened. 

Before we did the following we had barely any birds in the garden... We put up one of those stick in the ground multiple feeders which has three hooks with three different feeders on, a table/bowl and a water bowl . So what you've added to the garden should be plenty. The issue here maybe what food you use - what you feed when is important, however your question is about attracting so here is what worked for us: 

So I'm quite into foraging, and seaweed (the real thing not chinese take away stuff...) is supposedly very nutritious for you and very easy to forage up, but are there any seaweeds which are not edible, or possibly not worth eating, on UK shorelines? 

You can cook meat on a wooden skewer, piecing it like a kebab, and turning it frequently to prevent burning and to allow it to cook evenly. Similarly you can do this with two sticks and have the meat tied between the two. This is useful for smaller chunks, but becomes difficult with larger ones. You also will have to take care with dripping fat which can spit in the flames. In the same way meat can be spit roasted, but you would have to prepare a spit out of logs for this which could be too excessive. You can also cook meats on a heated rock, which is a technique still used in restaurants today for steak cooking. This should be easy enough if you have prepared a fire ring. A flat clean rock is best, and you can take the rock out of the fire to prevent spitting or over cooking. You can leaf wrap the meat and cook it over coals (I saw this on TV done with a deer, over heated coals and covered by sand / dirt) and leave it for a few hours. - I'm almost certain I saw this on Time Team, but can't remember the era. This is time consuming but works similarly to a bbq, as the coals are no longer on fire. 

As for the native species, these can be trapped soley for scientific research, and you again require written authorisation to do so. If you trap by accident simply return to the water where you found it, there won't be harm to them if they are trapped by accident, they just get a free meal off you. Be aware when catching an invasive species you cannot release it back into the wild, it must be kept, or killed. Source: Gov.uk trapping permission pages 

Yes. It is safe to be in your car when in a lightning storm. Cars (pretty sure not soft-tops) and planes act as a Faraday Cage Faraday cages are metal containers or meshes which protects against static and non static electricity. As a note... Top Gear also tested this in laboratory conditions with an artificial lightning generator and Richard Hammond inside the car. This is the YouTube for: Richard Hammond gets struck by lightning Top Gear 

Ok so I've not had mine too long but this is what I do - bear in mind I'm not 100% sure what kind of the many moulds that is but I'd say it's probably not pleasant. Vinegar should kill the mould. Mould stains, but it can actually simply be dead mould and has been treated. Leave it for a few hours and let it just seep into the valve. Chlorine based cleaning products, such as the ones you use in bathrooms to remove the mould (kills and removes the stain) could, if you soaked it, remove the stain as well. Neither of these would taste great (and chlorine isn't brilliant to ingest anyway, especially in the concentrations in household cleaning products), so you can then treat the valve with Bicarbonate of Soda, which you can pick up in any supermarket. We use BiCarb to remove bad smells and the mould you get if you leave a water bottle for too long. I'd actually recommend trying this first to see if it'll clean it up. Just be wary of chemicals vs the plastic, hence vinegar as an option, as you don't want to damage it. I try to fully drain and hang up my bladder above a sink to let it drip dry after every single use - even if I plan to use it again the next day. 

Ok so I'm getting a pull buoy to help with my pull exercises when swimming (and a kickboard for the same with kick exercises) and I want to know if I were to go to a lake or the sea and swim, is it advisable to use a pull buoy in tidal water / open water? Is it easy to use one out on big open water, or are there any techniques that differ to using one in the pool? For those unsure a pull buoy is a leg float that you hold between your thighs. 

Oxygen Clean*. Use Oxygen Compatible Air. Be serviced regularly. (I believe with SSI they're making this more frequent) 

Yes these could very well be for horses, especially if they are all between 2 foot and 3 foot high (feet and inches are the usual terms for all horse jumps). They could be cross country obstacles for eventing. Eventing is the term for either dressage, show jumping, or cross country, or more usually all three in combination (also known as horse trials). However these can be set up for sponsored rides as well - which is cross country where you raise money for charity. These can be anything from telegraph poles, to trimmed hedges, to tree trunks, to small poles held up, to actual gates / fences. I've done these before and even jumped an RAF glider. These can also include drops (vertical leaps down onto grass or water) or ditches (jump the ditch) or also water to traverse. Sometimes these are just convenient natural items though or have been placed for other sports and simply utilised by riders, and have not been placed deliberately by anyone for the sake of eventing but have been utilised for convenience. There is every possibility these are for another sport entirely, or to prevent trespassing. 

I got given a free can of Volvo Life Paint, the idea being you can spray any material and it'll become reflective under a light source. On the can it simply says it's less effective on shiny materials and that it'll wash off. Does anyone know if this will have any negative effects on the waterproofing of a material? 

Even with all this food available we had the Starlings poking holes in our lawn / flowerbeds for hours, it's a supplement for them, not a feast. We also don't have all food out constantly, we let it empty for a few days before refilling as this got the other species interested in the rest of the garden (but that's the next step!) With the above feeds and feeders we get: 

Great question. In the UK a lot of historical sites are not only accessible but encouraged to explore! You can hike around and in many hill forts, for example, many of which are on National Trust property so they often signpost how to get to them. You can (and I have!) hike over the Nine Barrow Downs, which is a very interesting site. It's a chalk hill formation down near Swanage. You can even find the odd Roman excavation to explore, but a lot of areas like this, and Corfe Castle (which is ultimately a ruin) do require paid for access. There are many however that gain a lot of traffic and therefore have had restrictions put in place, these include the world famous Stonehenge and Hadrians Wall. This is to preserve the architecture for future visitors. However you can gain access to certain parts of the wall, and Stonehenge I believe still has yearly access for druids. By this I mean they get full access and can go right up to the stones, which otherwise is prohibited. The UK has a very rich and varied history and as such we've plenty of historical sites, an abundance of which are free to hike in and around. 

How would you go about preparing an old fashioned torch for use in survival situations where an electrical torch has failed? 

First things first you need to contact the correct authorities. You require written permission to trap crayfish in the UK. There was an episode of River Cottage where they trapped them on the River Kennet. The Gov website doesn't list where you can or cannot trap signals, as you need landowners and angling club permission to trap on our lakes and rivers. 

Horse shoes come along the lines of wearing shoes as humans, all a hoof is is a giant nail which needs trimming and care (You do yours don't you?). Domestic horses should be re-shod or have their hooves filed every 4-6 weeks to maintain their hooves unless they throw a shoe. This is probably the biggest downside to shoeing a horse - in very muddy conditions older shoes tend to pull off like a welly! 

There are also a number of complicated rules that you have to pass in order to be able to compete, these include rules for the horse rider, for the board rider, and for the horses welfare: $URL$ I never got to do this as it's more recent than my riding career but I have watched it at country shows and it is a lot of fun (also lead to me kindly asking my dad 'Daddy I need another pony!' for a laugh).

It does apply, in some cases - it's actually a preference. For small game such as rabbits a neat little shot to the head with a high powered air rifle will kill the rabbit and save you from having to get the shot out afterwards. This is also most likely with small game that it's going to be much harder to pick out heart or lungs to aim to, the head is a clearer shot. For larger game there is the choice, deer, as in your example, stand high in the grass and it's much easier to pick out where the heart or lung shots would be. The reason people often pick heart or lung shots, especially with deer, is that a single shot kill is much more humane, and responsible, than having to shoot twice. The pro to shooting for the brain is the death should be instantaneous, the con is the target size... if you miss you'll spook the deer and it'll flee. The choice of shot will also depend on distance, bullet, your shooting ability, weather conditions... As for humans, well, a good shot anywhere can cause us to bleed out and die. It's almost the same preference - a head or chest shot can kill a person, but you're more likely to survive the latter.
