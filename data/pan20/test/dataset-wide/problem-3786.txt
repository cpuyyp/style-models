It is known that $C_b(Q)$ is linearly isometric isomorphic to $C(\beta Q),$ thanks to the following proposition. The following extension theorem is taken from Carothers's A Short Course in Banach Space Theory, Chapter $15$ Theorem $15.1.$ 

Let $X$ be a metric space and denote $f:X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}.$ It is easy to show that the following two statements are equivalent: $(1)$ For any real number $c$, we have $f^{-1}(-\infty,c)$ is open in $X$. $(2)$ For any $x \in X$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists open neighbourhood $U \ni x$ such that for all $y \in U,$ we have $f(x) + \varepsilon > f(y).$ If $f$ satisfies one of the above statements, then $f$ is said to be upper semicontinous. If we change $(1)$ from open to $F_{\sigma}$, do we have a similar characterization which involves $\varepsilon$? To be more precise, 

Definitions: Let $X$ be a Polish space (separable completely metrizable topological space). A function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is Baire Class $1$ if it is a pointwlise limit of a sequence of continuous functions. Baire proved that $f$ is Baire Class $1$ if and only if for every nonempty closed set $P\subseteq X,$ there exists a point of continuity of $f$ in $P.$ To measure the 'quantitative discontinuities' of $f,$ the oscillation rank is introduced, whose definitions are recalled below. Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and a Baire Class $1$ function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}.$ All ordinals considered below are countable. Recall that oscillation of $f$ at $x\in X$ on $P\subseteq X$ is defined by $$\omega(f,x,P) = \inf\{ \sup_{y,z\in U\cap P}|f(y)-f(z)| : U\text{ is open}, U\ni x \}.$$ Define iterative derivatives as follows: \begin{align*} D^0(f,\varepsilon,X) & = X \\ D^{\alpha+1}(f,\varepsilon,X) & = \{x\in D^\alpha(f,\varepsilon, X): \omega(f,x, D^\alpha(f,\varepsilon,X)\geq \varepsilon) \} \\ D^\alpha(f,\varepsilon,X) & = \bigcap_{\theta<\alpha}D^\theta(f,\varepsilon,X) \quad \alpha \text{ is a limit ordinal}. \end{align*} One interpretation of the iterative sets is that, we start with the whole space $X.$ Then we collect those discontinuities in $X$ where $f$ 'jump' more than $\varepsilon.$ Among those discontinuities, we do the same for transfinitely many steps. Let $\beta(f,\varepsilon) = \min\{\eta: D^\eta(f,\varepsilon,X)=\emptyset\}$ and oscillation rank of $f$ be $$\beta(f) = \sup_{\varepsilon>0} \beta(f,\varepsilon).$$ Note that the rank $\beta$ is investigated by Kechris and Denny and Tang. 

An A-S TFT is a functor from $\text{Bord}_{<n−1,n>}(\mathcal{F})$ to $\text{Vect}$ where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes a set of background fields, eg a spin structure. An extended theory is a functor from $\text{Bord}_n(\mathcal{F})$ to a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ that restricts to an A-S TFT on $(n−1)$- and $n$-manifolds. For a topological field theory to be a true “extension” of an Atiyah-Segal theory, the top two levels of its target (ie its $(n-1)^{\text{st}}$ loop space) must look like $\text{Vect}$. What other (physical) considerations constrain the choice of target category? The targets of invertible field theories are (by definition) symmetric monoidal $\infty$-groupoids and (therefore) can be represented as spectra. What constraints can we impose on target spectra of invertible theories; in particular, on their homotopy groups? 

Let $BG$ denote the classifying space of a finite group $G$. For which group cohomology classes $c\in H^2(G;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ does there exist a real vector bundle $E$ over $BG$ such that $w_2(E)=c$? 

Given two spectra $A$ and $B$, the set $[A,B]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $A$ to $B$ forms an abelian group. Can the dual abelian group $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ be expressed as a group of homotopy classes of maps between spectra? The Brown-Comenetz dual $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ of a spectrum $E$ is defined here. A key property of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ is that its homotopy is dual of that of $E$ in the sense that $\pi_*I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E=\text{Hom}(\pi_*E,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$. Naively, I suspect that $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ can be expressed in terms of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}A$ and $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}B$. What if I replace ${\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}$ by ${\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}$ or ${\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}}$? 

The theorem provides a linear isometry from $C_b(X)$ onto $C(\beta Q)$ by the mapping $F\mapsto F\circ e.$ However, I do not know whether there exists a Stone-Cech compactification for 'Banach space-valued' mapping, that is, 

Background and Definitions: Let $K$ be a compact metric space. We say that $f:K\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is of Baire $1$ if there exists a sequence of continuous functions $(f_n)$ converging to $f$ pointwise. The set $\mathfrak{B}_1(K)$ contains all real-valued Baire $1$ functions $f$ on $K$, both bounded and unbounded. For a Baire $1$ function $f:K\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, its oscillation rank $\beta$ is defined as follows: For any $\varepsilon>0,$ let $K^0(f,\varepsilon) = K.$ If $K^\alpha(f,\varepsilon)$ is defined for some countable ordinal $\alpha,$ let $K^{\alpha+1}(f,\varepsilon)$ be the set of all those $x\in K^\alpha(f,\varepsilon)$ such that for every open set $U$ containing $x,$ there are two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $U \cap K^\alpha(f,\varepsilon)$ with $|f(x_1) - f(x_2)| \geq \varepsilon.$ For a countable limit ordinal $\alpha,$ we let $$K^\alpha(f,\varepsilon) = \bigcap_{\alpha^{\prime}<\alpha}K^{\alpha^{\prime}}(f,\varepsilon).$$ The index $\beta_K(f,\varepsilon)$ is taken to be the least $\alpha$ with $K^\alpha(f,\varepsilon) = \emptyset$ if such an $\alpha$ exists, and $\omega_1$ otherwise. The oscillation rank of $f$ is $$\beta_K(f) = \sup\{ \beta_K(f,\varepsilon):\varepsilon>0 \}.$$ If $(f_n)$ is a sequence of real-valued functions on $K,$ let $K^0((f_n),\varepsilon) = K$ for any $\varepsilon>0.$ If $K^\alpha((f_n),\varepsilon)$ has been defined for some countable ordinal $\alpha,$ let $K^{\alpha+1}((f_n),\varepsilon)$ be the set of all those $x\in K^\alpha((f_n),\varepsilon)$ such that for every open set $U$ containing $x$ and any $m\in\mathbb{N},$ there are two integers $n_1,n_2$ with $n_1>n_2 > m$ and $x' \in U \cap K^\alpha((f_n),\varepsilon)$ such that $|f_{n_1}(x') - f_{n_2}(x')| \geq \varepsilon.$ Define $$K^\alpha((f_n),\varepsilon) = \bigcap _{\alpha' < \alpha}K^{\alpha'}((f_n),\varepsilon)$$ if $\alpha$ is a countable limit ordinal. Let $\gamma_K((f_n),\varepsilon)$ be the least $\alpha$ with $K^\alpha((f_n),\varepsilon) = \emptyset$ if such $\alpha$ exists, and $\omega_1$ otherwise. The convergence index of $f$ is the ordinal $$\gamma_K((f_n)) = \sup\{ \gamma_K((f_n),\varepsilon): \varepsilon>0 \}.$$ 

The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence \begin{equation*}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E),\end{equation*} computes the generalized homology $h$ of a total space $E$ of a Serre fibration from the ordinary homology $H$ of the base space $B$ with coefficients in the generalized homology of the fiber $F$. In particular, using the fibration $\text{pt}\rightarrow X\rightarrow X$ computes $h_n(X)$ from $h_n(\text{pt})$ and knowledge of the differentials. For simplicity, suppose that $h$ satisfies $h_0(\text{pt})=\mathbb{Z}$. (This may not be necessary in the end.) As a generalized homology theory , $h$ corresponds to a topological spectrum (also called $h$). Trivially, the Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum $H$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$; in particular, the homotopy groups agree at degree $0$ and there are no k-invariants to check. My intuition is that the spectral sequence refines $H$ by incorporating data from the higher degrees of the Postnikov tower of $h$. The new homotopy groups $\pi_n(h)$ in the Postnikov tower appear as the coefficient modules $h_n(\text{pt})$ in the spectral sequence, while the new k-invariants appear as differentials. Now, my question. Suppose $h$ and $g$ are topological spectra such that $g$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$. Is there an analog to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence that computes $h$ from $g$? (Perhaps Postnikov truncation is too strong or too weak an assumption. Please feel free to interpret my question to make it more interesting!) 

Notations: Recall that $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal. Let $X$ be a Polish space (completely metrizable and separable) and $F(X)$ be the collection of all real-valued functions on $X.$ A function $\rho:F(X)\to \omega_1$ is called an ordinal rank. In other words, ordinal rank assigns an ordinal to a function, typically measuring complexity of the function. 

The authors of the book mentioned that problem $84$ is an old classical open problem. So I suspect that there should be some papers available on solving the problem partially or fully. 

$2018$ Abel prize is awarded to Robert P. Langlands for his visionary program connecting representation theory to number theory. In particular, his program predicts the existence of a tight web of connections between automorphic forms and Galois group. 

The following open problem is taken from the book Open Problems in the Geometry and Analysis of Banach Spaces, page $40.$ 

The Langlands program is one of the examples as it connects representation theory to number theory, where the former and latter are two different fields. 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a pivotal tensor category. Feel free to assume finiteness, semisimplicity, fusion, sphericality, unitarity or whatever makes things interesting. Which of the following structures come for free? 

For a generalized homology theory $h$ and a Serre fibration $F\rightarrow E\rightarrow B$, we can define an Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence\begin{equation}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E)\end{equation}Suppose we have determined $E^\infty_{p,q}$ for all relevant $(p,q)$ and want to find $h_n(E)$. We have\begin{equation}\bigoplus_pE^\infty_{p,n-p}=\text{gr }h_n(E)\end{equation}where $\text{gr}$ is the associated graded space for some filtration $F_ph_n$ on $h_n(E)$. This determines $h_n(E)$ up to extension. Are there results about how to solve the extension problem for certain theories $h$? We sometimes have that $\text{gr }h_n(E)=h_n(E)$, in which case $h_n(E)$ is trivially obtained from $E^\infty_{p,q}$. For which $h$ and $E$ is this true? In my limited experience, this often (though not always?) holds when $h$ is ordinary homology $H$ or oriented cobordism $\Omega^{SO}$ and $E$ is the classifying space $BG$ of a finite abelian group $G$. Meanwhile, spin bordism tends to be less trivial; in particular, suppose $E^\infty_{p,n-p}=\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$, then $\text{gr }\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\bigoplus_{p=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$ often (always?) becomes $\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\oplus\mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N=\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} k_p$. Are these examples supported by general results? 

Let $X$ be a metric space. In Borel hierarchy, $\Sigma_{1}^0$ is the set of all open sets in $X$ while $\Pi_{1}^0$ is the set of all closed sets in $X.$ Then at next level, one has $\Sigma_{2}^0 = \{ \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n : A_n \in \Pi_1^0 \}$, that is, elements of $\Sigma_2^0$ are $F_{\sigma}$ sets. In $\Sigma_1^0$, its elements can be described in the following manner: $O \in \Sigma_1^0 \Longleftrightarrow$ $\forall x \in O, \exists \varepsilon>0$ such that $V_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq O,$ where $V_{\varepsilon}(x)$ denotes the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$. This definition is very useful as it allows us to visualize open set. 

Notations: Let $K$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space and $E$ be a real normed linear space. Recall that $C_0(K,E)$ is the set of $E$-valued continuous functions $f$ on $K$ such that $f$ vanishes at infinity. For any $t\in K,$ let $\psi_t$ be an evaluation functional on $C_0(K,E).$ If $X^*$ is a dual space of $X,$ then denote $ext(X^*)$ to be the set of extreme points of the unit ball of $X^*.$ The following corollary is quoted in the book 'Isometries on Banach Spaces: Function Spaces' by Fleming and Jamison, Chapter $2,$ page $33,$ 

There are two ways in which higher categories appear in topological field theory: in extended TFTs and in TFTs with defects. How are these appearances related? According to the Atiyah-Segal axioms, a d-dimensional TFT is a symmetric monoidal functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where the target category $\mathcal{C}$ is a symmetric monoidal category, typically $\text{Vect}$. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d$ are closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the vector spaces of $\text{Vect}$ under the TFT. The morphisms are d-dimensional bordisms of the closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the linear maps of $\text{Vect}$. This description can be "extended down" to define a d-dimensional n-extended TFT as a symmetric monoidal $n$-functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d^n\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where $\mathcal{C}$ is now an symmetric monoidal $n$-category. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d^n$ are $(d-n)$-manifolds (for a "fully extended" TFT, i.e. $n=d$, the bordism objects are points) and map to the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, which can be thought of as $(n-1)$-categories. One should really specify $\mathcal{C}$ as some extension of $\text{Vect}$, but I am ignoring this technicality by thinking of the n-category of all (small) $(n-1)$-categories. More generally, $k$-morphisms are $(d-n+k)$-dimensional bordisms between $(d-n+k-1)$-manifolds and map to $(n+k-1)$-categories. There are also technicalities surrounding how one manages "manifolds with corners" in $\text{Bord}_d^n$, but allow me to gloss over them here. Meanwhile, one uses higher categories to decorate manifolds with defects. In this picture, $k$-dimensional manifolds are decorated with $k$-dimensional (extended?) TFTs called "$k$-defects." Lower dimensional submanifolds can be decorated with "defects within defects." The $k$-defect assigned to a $k$-dimensional "boundary" between two $(k+1)$-dimensional regions, each with attached $(k+1)$-defects, amounts to a morphism of $(k+1)$-defects. Fusion of defects and sub-defects endows the set of $k$-defects with the structure of a $k$-category. (For details, see $URL$ If we again imagine the $k$-category of (small) $(k-1)$-categories, we can understand decoration as an assignment of $(k-1)$-categories to $k$-manifolds. This construction of TFT with defects feels "upside down" compared to extended TFT: $k$-manifolds are decorated by $(k-1)$-categories and map to $(d-k-1)$-categories under the TFT functor. I realize that decoration is not a functor from a bordism category, but is it a functor in some other sense (from some category where higher degree morphisms are lower dimensional submanifolds)? Defects may have an interpretation as inserted operators (Wilson loops, surface operators, etc); can these two formalisms be combined to compute path integrals with operator insertions in an extended theory? In general, I am curious about the relation between how higher categories are used to define an extended TFT and how they are used to characterize TFTs with defects. Here is a particular problem from $URL$ Consider a fully extended 4D TFT. The TFT functor assigns $1$-categories to Riemann surfaces $\Sigma$. Meanwhile, in the defect description, 2D TFTs form a $2$-category. Restricting ourselves to a single object leaves us with a symmetric monoidal category of $1$-dimensional domain walls (essentially boundary conditions) of the 2D theory. Is this category of boundary conditions identified with the category assigned by the TFT functor (as is claimed)? It seems that this identification is only possible since $\dim\Sigma=2=\text{codim }\Sigma$ in dimension four and does not reflect a general relation between extended TFT and TFT with defects.
