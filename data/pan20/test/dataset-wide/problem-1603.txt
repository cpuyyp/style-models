A large study from the UK published in the BMJ in 2010 suggests that pill users are not at extra risk compared to non-users. This study was designed to explore mortality from many causes not just cancer and its scale and longevity would tend to suggest it is a robust analysis. the design: 

Recent books by critics of the pharmaceutical industry (such as David Healy's Pharmageddon and Ben Goldacre's Bad Pharma) have highlighted problems in the way the industry promotes its products. In a 2010 article in Bioethical Enquiry, Spielmans and Parry argue the following (this is from their abstract): 

Stoping breathing while in a coma is not usually regarded as an acceptable side effect of a pain-relieving drug so recommended doses are set to minimise that risk. The problem being that the effective window where the patient gets relief from severe pain but doesn't stop breathing is narrow (one reason why using illegal sources where the concentration is uncertain is very risky). But we can gauge something about the relative "strength" of fentanyl from the medically recommended starting dosages of it and heroin when given for acute pain (these figs are from the BNF): 

Are the statistics quoted correct? And, more importantly, do they show that banning abortion is good for women as it reduces maternal mortality? 

Given the normal governmental attitude to recreational pharmaceuticals, this seems likely to be controversial. Is it true that access to marijuana can reduce the use of other drugs significantly? 

So it seems safe to conclude that Prostate cancer Screening doesn't save lives and may cause significant harm. 

It looks like our fear of cancer is giving drug companies an easy path to the approval of marginal or useless drugs. Is it true that most modern cancer drugs offer minimal benefits in the real world? 

The full paper is in the American Journal of Public Health but is paywalled. The key conclusion is that, when careful consideration of potential confounding variables is done, there is no relationship between fluoride intake and IQ. It is very easy for shoddily conducted studies to throw up false relationships and this carefully conducted study finds no relationship and suggests what some of the potential confounders in previous studies might have been. 

In this report of a mathematical model (original paper here) about the response of ocean plankton to climate change, its author claims the following: 

Neil Gaiman recently made what has been hailed as one of the best commencement speeches ever at Philadelphiaâ€™s University of the Arts (reported here, available as a book here). In it he talks about the value of literacy. As part of his argument he says (i'm quoting from this report of the speech): 

The (paywalled) article Web MD is referring to is here. In summary: the current state of knowledge recognises that some people have a reaction to gluten. This explains many of the anecdotes quoted by antiscientific scare sites. But, unless they produce hard statistics and proper evidence to the contrary (which they don't even attempt) their general claim is simply bogus. 

Are his specific claims about the trend in number of guns in the USA correct (specifically that the USA now has a lower level of gun availability than it used to have)? 

It wouldn't be appropriate to test the whole set of claims on both sides here. Let's stick with the differing accounts of the Hockey Stick paper's history as it has been widely discussed and debated. Which one is more accurate (I'm acknowledging that neither may be the unvarnished truth)? 

The UK government has recently started a consultation on increasing the speed limits on motorways (roughly the equivalent of highways in the USA) in England. So it seems appropriate to pose the question about whether this is a good idea. The early debate has highlighted the typical concerns of safety and worse fuel economy. So the usual suspects have already chimed into the debate with these sorts of arguments: 

There is a sound reason in human psychology why we keep believing the predictions of these theories: we remember predictions that seem to work and forget the other predictions of the same experts that don't work. So an expert can attract a body of evidence of successful prediction by making a number of alternative forecasts and then, after the event, erase the forecasts that were wrong. This problem is extensively discussed by dan Gardner in his recent book Future Babble, also by William Sherden in his book The Fortune Sellers and by Nicholas Taleb in Fooled By Randomness (all of which should be compulsory reading for all skeptics). Their key message is that it is really easy to be fooled by apparent patterns in noisy historic data, but they are rarely if ever true and even more rarely valuable when trying to make decisions about the future. In short Kondratiev cycles predict nothing useful. 

with the symmetry arising because of the way water molecules hydrogen bond to each other in networks. As Kenneth Libbrecht's fantastic article (NB pdf) on snowflakes explains: 

A recent widely reported news story (example report from the Independent) suggested that one explanation for the modern rise in obesity was not too much food or two little exercise but many of chemical additives common in the modern environment (especially those found in plastics). The news stories mostly wrote up the report as though a proper Cochrane-style meta analysis had been done. But the original report is not a proper meta analysis but a selective review of references produced by a lobby group. That doesn't mean their conclusions are wrong, but it should be a reason to apply some skepticism. So, are common plastic additives and related chemicals a plausible and significant cause of the modern rise in obesity? Or is this just another "chemicals are bad" scare? 

There are nearly two hundred other dioxins which differ from the two shown by having different numbers and locations of the chlorines attached to the rings. One of the reasons that caused concern about them was they they were significant contaminants in a range of chlorinated weedkillers (2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, for example, the major ingredients of Agent Orange). The wide use of these weedkillers exposed many people to their contaminants (both because of use and manufacture). One of the reason dioxins came to be regarded as one of the most deadly known toxins is that they are, to guinea pigs. A dose of 1 micro-g per kg will kill guinea pigs. In hamsters, however, the toxic dose is 5,000 micro-g per kg and there good evidence that people are much less sensitive to them than this. As a reference, botulinum toxin (one of the nastiest known human toxins) kills people at a dose of 10 micro-g per kg. While we can't do laboratory experiments on people to estimate the acute and chronic activity of dioxins, but we can estimate the effects from looking at people who have been accidentally exposed from chemical accidents. There have been several accidents in manufacturing plants and R&D labs, some of which exposed the public to dioxins. The most obvious human effect of dioxin exposure is chloracne which is nasty but reversible. Emsley quotes Michael Gough, an expert on the topic: 

In a recent Undercover Economist column in the Financial Times (The Ig Nobel prizes: in praise of ridiculous research), Tim Harford mentioned that there has been a study showing that cheap placebos are less medically effective than expensive placebos. This sounds slightly ridiculous, but, then, the placebo effect is fairly strange anyway. So how strong is the real evidence? Do expensive placebos have stronger effects than cheap ones? 

Another effect of water hardness that is almost certainly no longer relevant is that hard water prevents the accumulation of lead in water compared to soft water which tends to be acidic and leaches small amounts of lead from lead piping (which was relatively common in some countries until the 1960s). An older BMJ paper from 1973 summarizes this evidence like this: 

Restricting access to abortion is not an effective way to reduce its frequency A December 2016 article in The Economist argues that the most effective way to reduce abortion is the effective promotion of contraception. In passing the article mentions the following result (my emphasis): 

I've long observed that many drivers in the UK choose SUVs (which are often disparigingly called Chelsea Tractors) do so at least partially because they believe such cars to be safer. I doubt this claim. More importantly, the debate about safety has become a significant component of the US debate about fuel economy standards with some arguing against the government standards on safety grounds. For example, this article argues: 

There have also been recent meta-anlyses of many of the earlier studies. Here is the conclusion from a BMJ review in 2010: 

But other mainstream scientists accept the pause exists and seek explanations. A recent review in Nature starts with this admission: 

20 years of trying has only created niche markets for Windows Tablets It is worth reviewing a little history before attempting an answer to this question. The question asks whether Windows tablet PCs have ever been successful. I think this refers to Microsoft's Windows XP tablet edition in 2001. But Microsoft had launched a tablet OS in 1991. And even that wasn't the first (see potted history here). The fact that much of this history is forgotten is a product of the lack of success of these products. Here is part of the story as told by informationweek in january 2010: 

His general argument, that theory frequently postdates successful practice, probably deserves a separate question (which I will submit when I can formulate it carefully). But that specific assertion, imperfectly referenced, that only a handful of people in Europe, had mastered the mathematics of division by 1200 AD seems to be surprising. Is it true? 

Short answer: No the accuracy of past forecasts is mixed with no clear variant being usually better The most recent detailed analysis of how good the various projections have been was published in 2000: Beyond Six Billion: Forecasting the world's Population . This table summarises the accuracy of past forecasts for population in the year 2000: 

This seems fairly clear, but there are reasons to be skeptical. Surgical death rates are usually low so the numbers might not be as significant as the headline suggests. And there may be risk stratification if female surgeons don't have the same mix of patients as their male counterparts. Other potential objections to the reliability have been raised (see the article's comments for examples). So, is the headline a sound conclusion statistically? 

Yes there is an effect but it may not be as large as early studies suggested with a result of reducing heart attacks by 3-4% in some population subgroups The trouble with science in areas where there is a broad consensus is that many people don't check their results carefully when they agree with the consensus view. And when those results can be used as public health propaganda, there is a large does of overeager confirmation bias to account for. This effect may explain some of the results reported. Normally to get a good view of multiple studies we would use a meta analysis (and Fabian reports the results of one in his answer). The best meta-analyses in medical science are those done by the Cochrane Collaboration. Their latest review of the effects of smoking bans was conducted in 2009. Their general conclusion is worth quoting (my emphasis): 

The caveat at the end is partially a result of the cohort being relatively healthy which leaves the possibility that certain pre-existing risks might interact with the pill in ways that increase mortality. Overall, though, it doesn't look like the pill increases cancer rates in a healthy population. 

The charity Oxfam recently launched a media campaign about global inequality with the startling statistic (this page on their website): 

Is there any evidence that violent video games have a more significant contribution to school shootings than access to guns? 

It is worth noting that it also addresses some of the spurious positive claims for raw vs pasteurised milk (such as the ridiculous claim that pasteurisation causes lactose intolerance). 

It is very hard to prove they can't have 4-fold symmetry but we have a good understanding of why they usually have 6-fold symmetry under normal conditions. The structure of snowflakes is driven by the underlying symmetry of ice at temperatures near zero Celsius (or whatever that is in non-standard american units) and pressures close to atmospheric. The crystal structures at high pressures or extreme temperatures can be different (Ice IX, for example, has a tetragonal crystal structure so might form crystals with a four fold symmetry, but it it is only stable at low temperatures and high pressures, thank goodness). The underlying structure that drives six-fold symmetry in normal ice looks like this:
