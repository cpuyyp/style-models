I'm surprised no one has said Marsden and Hoffman's "Elementary Classical Analysis", but perhaps it is too elementary or classical. I didn't learn from it as an undergrad, but I did find myself turning to it as I worked problems from "Berkeley's Problems in Mathematics" by de Souza and Silva. M&H fleshes out a lot more detail, which Rudin spares for the sake of elegance or relegates to the exercises. I wish I had it or Korner's book "A First Second or Second First Course in Analysis" alongside Rudin when I first studied analysis. In particular, I prefer Marsden and Hoffman's treatment of Arzela-Ascoli over Rudin's. 

Analysis Situs by Poincare. This is the foundation of algebraic topology and illustrates its historical connection with dynamics. According to Wikipedia it has been translated, but I can't find a copy in English. 

I think our questioner is aware of the difficulties of switching fields and if not he or she soon will be, so let me be naive and try to be constructive. For Quantum Computation, Isaac Chuang and Michael Nielsen's "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" has become a standard introduction to the subject, suitable for a graduate student in either mathematics, physics or computer science. Since I have no idea what background you have in PDEs (you could be a specialist in D-modules for all I know and find these suggestions childish), here are some texts I've become acquainted with: -V.I. Arnold's "Lectures on Partial Differential Equations" gives a beautifully geometric and intuitive understanding of PDEs, introducing and weaving together contact and symplectic geometry. The table of contents looks quite basic, but it contains the depth you should expect from Arnold. -Lawrence C. Evans "Partial Differential Equations" is nice and contains the basic notions from Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces, Weak Theory and Regularity Theory. It does a good job of being self-contained and trying to give physical interpretations of various PDEs. -Gilbarg and Trudinger have the classic "Elliptic PDEs of Second Order", which is dense, but a classic nonetheless. As a mathematician you don't need to learn how physicists think in the next year. Physicists have different ways of looking at problems and are constrained to their own paradigms just as mathematicians are. It is often quicker to pick up advanced physics if you know advanced mathematics, with many excellent bridge texts by world-class mathematicians. Examples that come to mind are Bott's "Morse Theory Indomitable" which includes an exposition of some of Witten's ideas for a mathematician. Atiyah's "Geometry and Physics of Knots" is also an excellent example of this. Feynman's Lectures are great, but won't advance you to research. It's more like a Caltech undergraduate degree bound in 3 volumes. Finally, as a note of inspiration, I have heard of at least two new faculty who self-studied PDEs in their post-doctoral years. One was supplanting a thesis in deformation theory and integrable systems, the other in knot theory and Floer homology. It is definitely a hard path to follow, but is sometimes necessary for growth. Also, bear in mind that Ed Witten was a history major as an undergrad, dropped out of economics grad school before applying for Princeton applied math and then switching to physics. Raoul Bott switched from electrical engineering to mathematics after his PhD (a much harder path, one might argue). Finally, my personal hero, Douglas Hofstadter, after quitting his Berkeley math PhD and finishing a 7+ year physics PhD in Oregon, then lived at home for a few years re-tooling himself as an AI researcher. Now he has a Pulitzer and tenure at a university -- not too shabby. Good luck! 

In surveying the other responses to date it seems like many people have assumed that without assuming calculus the most we can hope for teaching undergraduate students is probability, statistics, fractions/percentages, brain teasers and puzzles. Aren't we shooting too low? For an extreme example of how far we might actually push such a course consider a quote of Arnol'd's in On teaching mathematics: 

One professor called it "the basis for truly 21st century mathematics." It is also reportedly accessible by beginning graduate students with some exposure to differential geometry and suitable for independent study or as a reading course. It is a 93 page paper and develops a lot of fundamental constructions and ideas from scratch. Here is Martin Guest's review on MathSciNet. 

I have had some conversations with Jon Woolf (the author of the paper referenced by Davidac897). He has pointed out that the forgetful functor from $for:\mathrm{Vect}\to\mathrm{Set}$ preserves limits, but not colimits. Thus a cosheaf of vector spaces need not define a cosheaf of sets and in particular cosheafifying for pre-cosheaves valued in one data category $\mathcal{D}$, may "look different" depending on what $\mathcal{D}$ is. One can view a pre-cosheaf $\hat{F}:\mathrm{Open}(X)\to\mathrm{Vect}$ as a pre-sheaf $F:\mathrm{Open}(X)^{op}\to\mathrm{Vect}^{op}$ and try to use Grothendieck's sheafification prescription, but this will not work either. The requirements for Grothendieck's sheafification (outlined on page 24 of Schapira's notes) is that the data category be one in which filtered colimits and finite limits commute, which for $\mathrm{Vect}^{op}$ boils down to the false statement that cofiltered limits and finite colimits commute in $\mathrm{Vect}$. The solution the following two papers get at is to work in the pro-object category, because there cofiltrant limits and finite colimits do commute, so the Grothendieck construction goes through. $URL$ $URL$ However, for some people (myself included), this is an unappealing solution. Pro-objects are diagrams in themselves, so a pre-cosheaf of pro-Vector spaces would assign to each open set a diagram of vector spaces. So here is something one can do: One can check abstractly whether cosheafification exists. This is equivalent to asking whether the inclusion functor from the category of cosheaves into the category of pre-cosheaves has a right adjoint. Freyd's general adjoint functor theorem says that, modulo set-theoretic issues, a functor has a right adjoint (is a left adjoint) if it preserves colimits. Since the category of cosheaves is clearly closed under colimits (one just defines open-by-open it to be the colimit, and since colimits commute, the cosheaf axiom holds for this colimit pre-cosheaf, i.e. the colimit is a cosheaf), then the inclusion functor does have a right adjoint. Of course, the devil is in the details, so I have written up the details and put them on my website here. I use an easier-to-check version of the adjoint functor theorem given by Vopenka's principle, but I think one could use the proof outlined to appeal to just Freyd's theorem. For more on cosheaves and their possible uses, the following might be of interest: $URL$ 

This isn't addressed to logicians, but it may be of interest. I happen to know of an example in PDE that was necessary in proving the well-posedness of radial solutions of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation: $$i u_{t}+\Delta u=|u|^{4}u$$ for which J. Bourgain was awarded his Fields Medal for treating. (J. Bourgain, Global well-posedness of defocusing 3D critical NLS in the radial case, JAMS 12 (1999), 145-171). In one of the many many critical steps required in this proof, a bound on energy is required. A team (J. COLLIANDER, M. KEEL, G. STAFFILANI, H. TAKAOKA, and T. TAO) have now treated the non-radial case and make explicit the large ordinals used for bounding the energy. I quote from page 36 of their paper "Global well-posedness and scattering for the energy-critical nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation in R^3": 

If you are looking for a break from Calculus and don't want to dive into Category Theory right away, my favorite book is Alan Beardon's Algebra and Geometry. What follows is an enhanced Amazon review I wrote as an undergrad. The Cambridge Schedules provide a wonderful guide to further study so do have a look. Beardon's book has become a bible of sorts to first-year students studying mathematics at Cambridge University (please refer to the Schedules for a beautiful play-by-play of topics and books by perhaps the best foundational math curriculum the world-over). Its quality as a text cannot be doubted, although its usefulness for further years of algebra is limited. This is precisely the book to study from if you are doing vector calculus and differential equations, but still aren't sure about doing mathematics seriously. If you have not taken a course in linear algebra or abstract algebra, buy the paperback copy (~$50) of this book and start reading right away. Beardon starts with (what I believe is the best way) the study of permutations (think about shuffling a deck of cards) to develop an intuition of the basic notions of a group. From here the fundamentals for further study in mathematics is laid. I won't repeat the table of contents here, as you can look for yourself, but believe me when I say that mastering the concepts in this book will serve you very well. I truly wish I had a course which devoted itself to the complete digestion of this book. I used it for self-study and found that it served me very well. It does not fall easily into the structure of most American math sequences, as these departments are often forced to "modularize" mathematics into semester-bite-sized pieces. I believe that this often has a negative impact on the appreciation of mathematics as a whole, especially at the nexus between doing basic calculus and appreciating proof, rigor and beauty in mathematical structures. The book may not go into the same depth as, say, Artin's "Algebra", but rather the foundational concepts for the study of algebra and geometry are emphasized in a variety of settings. This is very important as the study of "abstract algebra" is precisely that if you do not have a wide-selection of examples and contexts to draw from. This book has plenty of exercises of varying difficulty, and everything in this book is accessible to the beginning student of mathematics. Bottom line: If you are someone interested in learning linear algebra, geometry, group theory, Mobius transformations, complex variables all in a rigorous yet introductory level, this is the book for you. Developing a robust mental model for mathematics requires building several thin layers at a time. This means not going too deep too quickly, but rather snorkeling around the entire reef, before you gear up for further exploration. 

Set aside the hairy issue that this high school, which is already far more specialized than US high schools, was one of the premier math/physics high schools in Russia. Rather, pay attention to the fact that the first 220 pages of Alekseev's book is self-contained and no calculus is necessary. Also, consider the idea of a year-long course following Penrose's Road to Reality. Showing people mathematics' role in unraveling the secrets of the universe has always seemed far cooler to me than other tactics for inspiration. Let me be perfectly clear that I think actually requiring a course such as Arnol'd's across the board is overly optimistic. However, I think that by selecting the topics of such a course to reflect what mathematicians generally value could go a long way towards providing both a cultural appreciation of modern mathematics (as Lockhart's Lament would like) and an opportunity to think rigorously about initially simple objects (groups) and then more complex but visual objects (Riemann surfaces). If people are pessimistic that "liberal arts majors" don't have the goods to think about group theory, then I would much rather have a history of mathematics course that follows something like Stillwell's Mathematics and Its History, leaving students with the impression that mathematics has a rich philosophical undercurrent, than bore them with a meaningless pursuit of graph theory, probability and a smorgasbord of seemingly unrelated topics. The prevalent idea among many people seems to be that we have to make sure that basic numeracy is in place and that this is the math department's job. I don't think that innumeracy is a problem with the school system as it stands. People just forget their middle school and high school math because to them mathematics is an uninspired dead subject that is just plain boring. Let's change that.
