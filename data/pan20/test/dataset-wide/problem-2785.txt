If you make the supposition that no thing inside the universe could generate the universe and that every thing that exists is inside the universe than the direct conclusion is that the universe was not generated by a thing, which is similar to saying that it was generated by nothing. The difficulty here is that you have to ask yourself what you mean by "thing" and "nothing" and whether "nothing" means the same thing as "not thing". The field of philosophy has historically been very interested in questions of this nature. There are several places that this argument can be attacked. The first would be to attack the premise, and argue that there might be entities outside of the space time continuum. Platonic forms would be an example of proposed entities that exist but are not "things" inside the universe. We could also attack the application of cause--saying that the universe "came from" something implies rules of cause and effect that only exist inside the universe itself. The universe didn't "come from" nothing, because the words "come from" have no meaning outside of the universe. That would be the scientific position... that you can't use concepts relating to time and space outside of time and space. Based on the former point, you can't assume that a universe can't create itself. Since time, space, and the laws of cause and effect don't apply outside the universe, some form of cosmic event could be occurring inside the universe that somehow reaches outside the universe and in fact is what creates the universe. So premise 2 could be invalid. Edit There is another flaw in this proof, which is that it defines the universe--that is, the space time continuum itself--as a thing bounded by the same rules as every other thing in the universe. However, there are properties of the universe which are not properties of any thing within the universe, for example, the universe itself can expand (that is, generate additional space and time) without apparently getting that space and time "from" anywhere. So it isn't clear that the universe is a "thing" in the sense that a particle is a "thing". It all comes down to definitions. Further Edit Based on comments, you seem to believe that we cannot reject 11 without rejecting 2. That isn't true. As I've pointed out, we can reject 1 or 2. Most people reject 1, that is, the majority of humans believe that there is more to reality than the universe of things, and given the nature of the universe, 2 is not supportable when applied to the universe since cause and effect are only valid within the universe. We could point out that since anti-matter exists and moves backwards in time, 2 is invalid even within the universe. Further, we could accept 1 and 2 and still reject your argument by questioning whether the universe is itself a "thing". This is a major unstated premise of your argument, and without it your argument does not hold at all. In fact, it would be just as valid to use your reasoning to show that the universe is not a thing! If you insist that the universe is a thing, we could point out the difficulty of having a set contain itself, since this leads to Russel's paradox, and question what version of set theory you are using and attack that. The fact is, it's difficult to prove things about the origin of the universe. That's why there is a field of cosmology at all, and why the field of philosophy continues to have new ideas despite having thousands of years of literature to draw on. 

A further edit in response to sehe's comment. The properties I'm listing in my first answer are not properties of an intangible thing, or forces of nature like gravity. I'm saying that in order for a book to convince a rational person that it was written by a god, the book itself--the thing written on parchment, stone tablets, clay, or other media--would have to have those properties. I'm saying that if I wanted to read part of the Book, I would have to be able to reach out into thin air and conjure a copy of the Book, and that I couldn't conjure any other book. That's criteria 4. Criteria 3 means that whenever humans discuss the book, they agree. No exceptions, not even between teenagers and parents. The book is also a source of unlimited electrical power, because it can be conjured and burned indefinitely, but depending on the contents people might or might not do this. 

I think these are two different questions. Whether something has aesthetic value is somewhat different than the question of whether it is art. A sunset is beautiful, but it isn't commonly considered art. The appreciation of nature and natural beauty is in the realm of aesthetics. Sports would fall under the category of culture, certainly, and the appreciation of culture is a branch of aesthetics as well. So the appreciation of a style of play could be considered aesthetic appreciation. For example, every play--a goal in hockey or soccer, a pass in football, a double play in baseball--has the same objective value. An out is an out, a point is a point. But editors on sports channels like ESPN use their aesthetic judgement to evaluate which plays are exceptional and feature them as highlights. Oftentimes sports that get very little attention will have featured highlights when someone does something extraordinary for the sport. So, yes, the playing of sports has an aesthetic element and this element is generally appreciated by sports fans, but no, in the sports with objective scoring, the aesthetic value doesn't matter as much as the objective outcome. 

Experiments are an excellent way to determine what works, and what does not. A great deal of scientific research is concerned with pragmatic matters and determining what does and what does not work: an obvious example would be medical research, but people also examine whether certain activities lead to certain results, such as whether writing an essay improves your physics grade. Pragmatism does not state that if it appears to work, it is true. "It" has to actually work, for a given definition of "it" and "work". Science is a toolkit for finding out what the actual definition of "it" is, and therefore learn what, if anything, works. 

If by "make" you mean imposing a conversation on someone that they don't want to have, than I would say yes, it's unethical to force an elderly person to listen to you talk about religion or anything else. To barge into a dying persons room and insist on talking about things they don't want to talk about is definitely unethical. But outside of the implied use of force, I would say no. Suppose I am talking to an elderly person of of sound mind who might die "soon", soon being "sooner than I am". This person knows I don't follow their religion and asks me what I believe, and we have a conversation about this. It isn't unethical for me to answer questions honestly and make points cogently if the other party is interested and engaged in the conversation, regardless of the subject matter. An old person is an adult and perfectly capable of deciding what they do and do not want to talk about. This is true of people on their deathbeds as well, provided they aren't on massive doses of painkillers or otherwise incapacitated. So really, it depends on who started this conversation and how sound of mind they are at the time. A dying person only has so much time, and they can decide how they want to spend it. If you decide for them, that's not ethical--their time is pretty valuable and you're just wasting it.
