I suppose we have to exclude the Confederate Navy entirely, otherwise this question would be far too easy to answer. At least in recent times, such an act would be in violation of the US Code Title 10, Subtitle C, Part IV, Chapter 633, 7309. The President can apparently waive this however. Reference: $URL$ All of the boats acquired during the Spanish-American war that were from overseas were just purchased. None that I can find were actually built for the United States Navy. This point in US Navy history is probably the point at which the largest percentage of United States Navy boats were of foreign construction. About 125,000 tons were purchased. Reference: $URL$ The National Defense Reserve Fleet contains numerous foreign built vessels, but again none were ordered by the US Navy at any point in time. Since there is no clear answer here, I'll submit the SBX-1. SBX-1 was at one point a boat of the Missile Defense Agency, part of the Department of Defense. As of 2018 the MDA presently has an Air Force General as its head, but SBX-1 is an oceangoing vessel with a clear combat purpose. SBX-1 hull started life as a CS-50 oceangoing platform. It was purchased from the Norwegian firm Moss Maritime. To make it more interesting that hull actually comes from Sevmash, a Russian company who made it in Severodvinsk. Final fitment was done in US ports located in Texas and Hawaii. So it isn't a US Navy boat, but it was at one point part of the US military structure. It has no offensive capabilities either. 

As you said, the ninja or shinobi was first and foremost a master of disguise. This was known as Hensojutsu, the art of disguise. From Hatsumi, Masaaki. The way of the ninja: secret techniques. Kodansha International, 2004. p92 For most missions a sterotypical black ninja outfit would not have been the most prudent option. The ninja then attempted to look like whatever the situation called for. Some examples below. 

2) The number of women was kept to a minimum. In earlier times wives and children were often taken on campaign. With the Macedonian army this was no longer allowed as to make the army more manageable. Alexander’s soldiers could visit their family in Macedonia from time to time to make the separation more doable. This made the army as light as possible and capable of surprisingly fast marches. 3) Alexander also kept into account the beasts of burden and the slower vehicles. Carts were generally forbidden. Even those pulled by oxes. Their top speed was too low for keeping up with the rest of the army. This measures made the Macedonian army far more efficient than before, but the army still required several tonnes of food and water each day. Alexander took several precautions to ensure a secure food source. For a better look at this see: Ashley, James R. The Macedonian empire: the era of warfare under Philip II and Alexander the Great, 359-323 BC. McFarland, 2004. Even with fewer extra carriers and camp followers to maintain food was an issue. The Macedonian army was still several ten thousands strong with a great deal of warhorses. Ashley calculates that this would consume at least 750 tonnes of dry provisions. He mentions that Alexander took the following precautions. 1) He tried to spend as much time as possible next to a river or the sea during winter. This made perfect sense as this would make close access to water possible. There was also the Macedonian navy which could deliver food if needed. Alexander's navy was not large by any means, but it still existed. 2) He split up the army when a river or the sea was not accessible. A smaller group of soldiers is more vulnerable, but it is also more nimble and can gather food more easily. 3) He stayed close to populated centers. Populated centers needed a decent food supply, Alexander could also benefit from this. 4) The soldier’s rations consisted of wheat, barley or millet which are not going bad in hot weather and are easy to transport. All these products can be moved without harming them and stayed eatable for far longer than items like fruit would. Note by Ashley: During a march through harder terrain, like a desert or the Hindu Kush, the demand for food would become much higher often resulting in temporary starvation like during the march in the desert of Gedrosia. In general, logistics were well taken care of. According to Ashley the techniques of Alexander made his army twice as fast as the Persian one. My recommendation For further reading I would really suggest Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army. The answer I written down here is but a pale shadow of its depth. I would expect most universities that have a department for Ancient History to carry a copy. You could also check Lonsdale, David J. Alexander the Great: lessons in strategy. Routledge, 2007. It makes quite a lot of good points about the importance of a decent cashflow, a reliable navy and the importance of weather conditions. I mostly left those out in my answer to keep the answer contained. Short anwer: Alexander understood that taking care of logistics was of the greatest importance and took great precautions to make sure they were reliable.

After World War II, plenty of radar aimed guns were developed for the purpose of targeting the guns of anti-aircraft vehicles. Why hasn't this same technology been applied to tanks? A 900 MHz radar unit would operate on a wavelength of 33.3 cm. This seems like it would be more than accurate enough to aim the main tank of a gun. I would also think that a tank would be an excellent target with lots of strong radar returns. Some tanks have rounded turrets, but there is usually something flat with hard edges that should show up on radar. The output would need to be fed into a gun computer to calculate an aiming solution, but those have been around for quite some time. 

1) Soldiers had to carry their own weapons and there was one servant for every 4 soldiers. This lower number of servants decreased the size of the army significantly. For this also see Polyaenus Strat. 4.2.10 (Translation from $URL$ 

Some pages earlier, the author Rzepka admits that his interpretation can be challenged since the plural of royal squadron is only used once. On p47 

Translation from Plutarch. Plutarch's Lives. with an English Translation by. Bernadotte Perrin. Cambridge, MA. Harvard University Press. London. William Heinemann Ltd. 1919. 7. The story of Plutarch might very well be somewhat embellished, but Alexander’s later attention to his logistics during the campaign in Persia suggests that there was a core of truth to it. Let me paraphrase some examples from the rest of the book From p12 onwards: In general Alexander kept his armies' numbers at a minimum. 

There are many historical accounts of "trials" in the Soviet Union. However, they tend to center around trials which are political trials. For example, a government agent accused of treason. How did a criminal trial in the Soviet Union work? Specifically I am interested in the time immediately after World War 2. 

The concept is known as abdication. In some cases of history, leaders of a monarchy have been "allowed", or in reality coerced to give up the throne to a family member. Since you specifically brought up Tsar Nicolas II, we can definitely say no. He attempted first to abdicate to his son, then quickly to another family member Grand Duke Michael Aleksandrovich. The new government at the time was known as the Provisional government and did not accept this. But more importantly, this was essentially the beginning of the Russian Civil War. No party ever endorsed the Grand Duke and it was not until the end of the Russian Civil War that one party established power in Russia. Reference material: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

The Macedonian army was indeed relying on a well-established logistics organization. The following book, as already mentioned in the comments, is probably the most well-known one about the subject and quite possibly the best too. Engels, Donald W. Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army. Univ of California Press, 1980. According to the author your friend was quite correct in his statement that the Macedonian logistics were quite formidable, but often overlooked. To prove this point, he points to the fact that while Alexander the Great is foremost remembered as a great military commander during battle, he was also wise to the necessity of having a reliable supply line and the intelligence services needed to keep it secure. He points to a story from Alexander’s childhood for this. Plutarch’s Life of Alexander 5.1. 

The B-17 was used for a significant portion of the Allied campaign during WWII. My understanding is the earliest bombs in aviation consisted of just throwing stuff out of the open cockpit of planes. Later this progressed to some doors in the fuselage through which bombs simply fell out when opened. The B-17 appears to have a more complex bomb bay system, with doors and with the bombs mechanically retained somehow. Did Allied crews ever experience difficulty getting the bombs to release? How did they deal with this (landing with bombs seems dangerous)? Does any data exist for what percentage of missions encountered problems with the bomb release mechanisms? 

Obviously, the Whiskey class submarine was not acquired to serve in a combat role alongside the Romeo class submarines. What is meany by "battery charging hulk"? Is there a need for additional charging capacity in some circumstances? Is the vessel able to move under its own power? Are the electrical systems of the two classes compatible? Are they any vessels produced explicitly as battery charging vessels? 

From Rzepka, Jacek. "The units of Alexander’s army and the district divisions of late Argead Macedonia." Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 48.1 (2008): 39-56 comes a possible answer. On p49 

As conclusion: A ninja indeed used a specific outfit that blended in when infiltrating. The color black was used, but it was only a small part of the ninja apparel. Their clothes' color was adapted to their surroundings 

From Turnbull, Stephen. "The Ninja: An Invented Tradition?." Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective 9.1 (2015): 3. p12 For their commbat missions, however, a ninja fell back on armor that blended with his environment. The color needed to be flexible since black is not a good choice for blending in at all times. Colors like earth brown, watery blue and even snow white were utilised. The author below descibes the ninja's armor as rainbow colored to fit in with the colors of nature.
