In The Shadow Dragons, the party that sets off from The Flying Dragon via trump gets stuck in an "endless expanse of whiteness": 

This implies that seniors were handed steppers and told to go. But in the very beginning of the book, it says that steppers only worked if the user completed the assembly themselves. How could this work? The twisting of the wire required to complete the assembly obviously required some dexterity, and it would almost certainly take longer than the less than 60 second timeframe it apparently did. 

This doesn't really say anything about religion, but it's included for the sake of completeness. Likewise, all the occurrences of "god" or "gods" aren't related to Gulliver's beliefs, but the beliefs of the inhabitants of the land that he is in. TL;DR: he's religious enough that he calls himself a Christian and doesn't to want to trample on the cross, but no other mention of him going to church or anything like that. 

In The Long Earth, when the bomb was about to go off in Datum Madison, people were fleeing by means of stepping. 

There's no clear consensus, probably due to the fact that the author is very tight-lipped (as you noted). The best theories/notes about the epilogue are as follows: 

This is The Immortal Bard (in some copies of Earth is Room Enough, it's titled as "An Immortal Bard"), a short story by Isaac Asimov. 2 professors are having a drink at a cocktail party of sorts. The physics professor, Dr. Welsh, is moderately tipsy (read: pretty drunk). He strikes up a conversation with a young English professor, Dr. Robertson. Welsh claims to have invented a technology to allow him to bring people back from the past. He's tried Archimedes, Newton, Galileo, and possibly others. However, they couldn't adjust to life in the 20th century. So next, he brings back Shakespeare. Shakespeare is enthusiastic, and glad to hear that humanity loves his work. (Asimov is totally not biased) To see how people treat his works now, Welsh enrolls Shakespeare in an afternoon lecture course, taught by Robertson. Welsh then has to send Shakespeare back, not due to any mechanical error. Robertson flunked Shakespeare, and Shakespeare couldn't stand the embarrassment. 

In the first book of The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica, Here There Be Dragons, Stellan Sigurdsson is told to have smoked a special mix of cinnamon and tobacco. 

But the king of them all is Xanth, with 39 years and counting! By Piers Anthony, this series started in 1977 and a book is planned for this year also, in April. That will be year 40. Shannara is also 39 years, but it doesn't have a new one coming out as far as I know. 

He was definitely a Christian, and devout enough not to want to desecrate the cross. In part III, he says: 

He found it in The Murder on the Links, and he made that statement in Lord Edgware Dies. In chapter 7 of Lord Edgware Dies, Poirot mentions this: 

Short of publicity stunts, there's not really anything clear-cut as to the differences. However, it's likely a publicity stunt due to this: 

Most likely real, by the laws of the fantasy world. Of course this is a fictional book, but in-universe they are real. 

Is Aivas, the artificial intelligence discovered in the Pern books, ever mentioned in some of the prequels? I can't find any reference to it in books set before the time it was discovered, including in Dragonsdawn and the other early books. 

Swift certainly had sailed before, probably many times. An easy example is from Great Britain to Ireland and back. Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1667. In 1688, he had to leave for Moor Park in England due to political troubles in Ireland. He made many visits to Ireland while living in England, mostly due to his health. He finally retired to Scotland again in 1700. As this picture so helpfully shows, it's impossible to get from Great Britain to Ireland without the aid of a plane, jet ski or other flying or water transportation. 

The Father Christmas Letters were written for his children, he wrote them pretending to be Santa. Roverrandom, a children's book about a dog and a wizard. Farmer Giles of Ham, a comical fable about a farmer. 

TL;DR: Oldest version of the poem is from around 2000 BC, the first version to depict the flood is around 1300-1000 BC. In the book The City of God by Saint Augustine (best reference I can find), Moses is told to have been born in 1400 BC and died in 1201 BC. Augustine also pens Moses as the author of the whole Pentateuch, so the flood story was written by him at some point during his lifetime. So the Biblical flood story was written from around 1430-1201 BC, whereas the first version of The Epic of Gilgamesh to contain the flood story was written from 1300-1000 BC. So it's possible either way, but it's most likely they were written somewhat concurrently. Do note that it's unknown for sure whether Moses wrote the Pentateuch, but since the end of Genesis/beginning of Exodus (the first 2 books) discuss Moses, it's necessarily at this time period or after. (IIRC there is a 50 year gap between the books however) 

This is the little paragraph on my copy of this book. I only have the male edition. But according to google, the female edition is the same with swapped gender words. This is probably a gimmick, though you can definitely read something into it. Sorry to just quote something, but this page has the best summary of it I could find. I wrote this answer, looked up what other people said, and then decided to include this quote: 

This is From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, by E. L. Konigsburg. The brother and sister in question are Jamie and Claudia Kincaid, who run away from home. They live in the Metropolitan Museum. Jamie did both of the things that you describe with the cards: 

(chapter 7) This is in reference to The Murder on the Links, where a 4 (or two, see below) foot pipe is used to disfigure a victim's face to make it unrecognizable. On a side note, in The Murder on the Links, the pipe is said to be two feet long. 

Brobdingnag doesn't represent a specific nation as Lilliput and Blefuscu do. Brobdingnag are giants, but they are pointed out as extremely ugly. They have very strict morals, but they don't regard Gulliver as a man really. Gulliver thought of the Lilliputians as miniature versions of himself, but the Brobdingnagians thought Gulliver was just a toy or tool. The first Brobdingnagian Gulliver met tried to make money off of him. The Brobdingnagians seem to have very strict morals, because they didn't approve of the English politics and way of life and called them "odious vermin". Swift depicts the Brobdingnagians as morally sound giants, though they seem to sit upon their high moral ground looking down upon everybody else. 

The hound represents the government's control and advanced technology. Originally, dogs served the firemen. They sniffed out the injured or weak. However, in this dystopia, the dog has been made into a watchdog of society, punishing those who don't obey the rules set by the government. 

Yes, you can think of it that way. However, the true antagonist in a way is Cory. He's the most likable person, but he's the person whose goals are against Troy's. But yes, you can say Troy is his own antagonist. This book doesn't really have a strict antagonist, either would be a good match for the definition. 

It addition, it is mentioned in Dragonsdawn, which covers the landing to the beginning of the first Pass. Aivas isn't referred to by name, so I'm not certain whether this refers to Aivas specifically, but I think so. In the first section of the book, it says: 

I read this not long ago, maybe a year. It was either a short story or a novella, certainly not longer. Read in English, in the US. The story was definitely older though, no clue exactly when but probably before the 2000s. (I remember very yellow crackly pages in my copy) One quote that I distinctly remember was something along the lines of: 

According to Merriam-Webster, either or . (hwi-num or who-i-num) The upside e is a schwa, representing a light and unaccented "uh" sound. That's about it. 

Who is he? All we know is that he's an old man, lives (or at least exists) in a place called Platonia, and is either a member or acquaintance of a group called the Quorum. Who is he, or who does he represent? 

Furthermore, the gnomes and the "stately figures taller than men" bear a resemblance to D&D's deep gnomes and drow. Forgotten Realms seems to have the varying levels as well. Is there any direct evidence (i.e. quotes from designers or hidden Narnian references) implying that the Underdark was inspired by the world in The Silver Chair? 

J. D. Salinger is a well-known 20th century author, most notably of Catcher in the Rye. He was fairly prolific, writing many stories. Do any of these stories share the same universe? 

Orwell doesn't satirize imperialism, but he seems to say it doesn't work well. He acknowledges it's flaws, primarily the fact that the people aren't too happy. At the start of the book, Mr. Jones is a successful farmer. His animals aren't being mistreated, though they are treated as animals and thus not equal to humans. They are mostly content (not really happy though), but they jump at the chance to had a 'democratic' group (nation? farmyard? barnyard?) of animals. So in Orwell's mind, imperialism may not be the best system, but it's certainly productive. However, it's vulnerable to revolutions such as the pig's revolution. Also note that Orwell appears to be satirizing England/the US and Germany with Mr. Pilkington and Frederick, not really their political systems specifically. 

Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Chapter XIV: The Beginning of the End of the World So when he's recovered, he'll go back to being in the sky. It's kind of like a sabbatical for stars. Also, stars can come down for other reasons and still be fully able to fly in the sky. 

The Ice Dragon is a children's book by George R. R. Martin, about a girl born during the long winter. The universe shows some similarities to the main universe of ASOIAF, but is it the same universe? 

No. All of the Hardy Boys books are separate storylines. They sometimes reference the previous books, but never give away the "solution" or too much of the plot. 

And then later in chapter XI, he begs the Japanese emperor not to force him to trample on the cross: 

(also in chapter 7) This seems to just be a minor discrepancy, and I don't think the difference really matters. 

And BOOM! all his dreams are crushed when he's arrested, especially knowing that he was observed. The Party doesn't just want to stop him, they want to crush his spirits also. From the book: 

He could also have been seeing if Winston and/or Julia would lead him (O'Brien) to more traitors, to stop them also.
