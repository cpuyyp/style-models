I think in answer to your question, it's going come down to what is your starting point? Are you new to lifting or been lifting for some time? Have you had any joint weaknesses? This article seems quite useful:- $URL$ Also, have you considered resistance bands for working out at home? There's lots of exersises you can do, and they come in different strengths. Perfect for working out, when space is limited. There are various websites that stock them but here's one $URL$ Another alternative you may consider is TRX $URL$ all you need is a door frame. Mainly, useful to make body weight exercises more challenging, but TRX, plus weighted vest could give you an awesome workout. 

If you're fit enough to do interval training. Either running, or on the bike or rowing are all good. However, don't forget to add some resistance training. Choose to work the larger muscles, as muscles burn calories. Ie if you change body fat into muscle you will burn more calories. 

I am a Personal Trainer, and to determine whether a programme is any good or not. There are a number of things you need to find out about the client first. Firstly what is the clients goal? A programme written for weight loss would look very different for one written to increase muscle size. Again someone who was deconditioned against a sports person. One programme, most definitely does not fit all. Even 2 people with the same goal, may need different programmes depending on their fitness level and lifestyle. So a good programme is one that is client specific. It's important to help the client set SMART goals specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time framed. This is the starting point of any decent programme. Regarding muscle groups, it still comes back to the goal. For weight loss, you need to work the larger muscles, for full body workout. Working opposite muscles works quite well. Doing less reps heavier weights, or more reps lighter weight, it all comes back to, why are you doing it, and what do you want to achieve. Lifestyle, hobbies, age and more are all consideration when writing a programme. I hope this goes some way to answering your question. 

I think you'll be fine. The compression clothing is designed to be tight, and if you can fit into it, you should be good. As far as taking it off... I agree it can be a little weird, depending on what piece of clothing it is. I like to kind of peel it off, as opposed to the normal shrugging off I would do with normal clothes. Honestly there's no way I can prove to you that you won't damage your clothes by taking them off, but if they're well made they should be pretty durable. And my guess is you'll develop some interesting dance moves to get them off over time :) I have a few pairs of compression shorts and compression tops, and none of them have ripped or deformed in spite of my sometimes hilarious means of removing myself from them. 

I've heard that hitting a heavy bag is taxing enough that it is easy to overtrain using it, especially for beginners. How much rest should the average person (i.e. NOT a boxer who grew up hitting things) take in between intense heavy bag sessions to let the muscles, joints, tendons etc. recover? On a similar note, what caution signs should someone look for to avoid injury/overtraining on the heavy bag? I know wrist pain is something to look for. Anything else? 

Presuming that your goal is to eventually run the whole way I would start with a five minute fast walk. Then run for 5 minutes(if that's the most you can currently do). Then walk, then run. Use a stop watch though, and try to be strict with yourself. Start with five minutes walk, 5 minutes jog, on your next run start to reduce the time you walk do 5 minutes jog, 4 minutes walk and gradually decrease the walking time every time you go out. You may find you need to slow the pace of the run to be able to run more of it. Going too fast is a very common problem with beginners. The other reason why I think this is a better approach, is because your heart rate will be raised for more of the walk/run, and you will get fitter quicker. If possible try to walk at a reasonable pace on the walking section. This will all become much easier, the fitter you get. 

This is normal to need more sleep. If you were swimming 20-30 minutes yes you will feel energised, but if you are swimming for an hour it's pretty normal to feel tired and need more sleep. Maybe you should mix things up a bit. Some days a shorter swim, some days longer. I'm sure there are some swimmers out there. That could suggest some interval sessions. But depending in your goal, I would just mix the distances up a bit. Ie hard easy days, to help you recover, and for you to feel more energised on the shorter recovery days 

Typical compression clothing, in my experience, won't give you much direct performance benefit (running faster, lifting heavier etc). The reason I wear compression shirts/shorts are mainly for comfort and temperature control. If it's really cold out, compression heat clothes can help you stay warm and limber. And if it's really hot, long-sleeve compression cold gear actually helps your sweat evaporate, cooling you off (remember to drink a lot of water in this case). Also, compression shorts are nice and tight, meaning they won't ride up and cause chafing on runs or long bike rides. It also just kind of feels cool to wear them, you feel a bit like a pro athlete wearing super cool gear :) Basically, unless you're going to be playing in extreme weather, or if you have some underwear problems, I would say compression clothes are unnecessary. 

I remember reading about this topic a while ago. I don't remember the exact articles I read, but the upshot was this: static stretching BEFORE strength/explosive movements is at best irrelevant and at worst actually decreases performance. Here is a page with a summary of a few different studies that seem relevant: $URL$ With that being said, I do think there is something you should do before any workout - and that is warm up - especially if we're talking about heavy lifting or explosive movement. Stretching seems to me to be a somewhat misguided attempt to 'loosen up' the muscles before working them, in the hopes of preventing injury, when what you really want is a good warmup. Here is a good article from Joe DeFranco on the whole subject: $URL$ Not exactly a scholarly article, but DeFranco trains some very strong people professionally and I think his thoughts are well-grounded in real-world experience. It's a bit of a contrived comparison, but if you think of your muscles as a kind of elastic material, like a rubber band for example, the whole warmup concept is a bit more intuitive. Would you rather put a lot of stress and force on a rubber band that has been taken out of the refrigerator 2 seconds before, or one that has been flexed gently for a few minutes until it is more pliable? I also remember reading that if you do want to do static stretching, you can feel free to do it post-workout - when your muscles are still warm (so you can actually stretch farther) and so that you don't have to worry about any performance degrading (your workout is over anyway). This blog kind of sums it up nicely: $URL$ 

It very much depends on how long you have been running, but for someone who has been running a number of years. Yes I'd agree that early to mid 30's you are likely to see your best performances regarding the marathon. However, you do hear very good performances even in to later 30's. As I said, it very much depends on your running background. 

Like others have suggested, you need to see a medical person, I would suggest a physio or osteopath. I think it is unlikely to be shin splints, and more likely to be chronic compartment syndrome. $URL$ This is when you increase exercise volume and the muscles grows faster than the muscle facia. It can be extremely painful. But the good news is you can recover much quicker than from shin splints. A series of very deep massage, will help a lot. An Osteopath really helped with mine. This is not to be confused with acute compartment syndrome which is a medical emergency. See the above link for a better explanation. I have a lot of running/run coaching experience, but I'm not medically trained, so please do get some expert advice. 

That's quite a lot of training for some one who has only been training for a month. However, you are doing well and to be running 45 minutes for 10k already is very respectable. To be able to add more quality training to your week, I would change the structure slightly. Monday easy run/shorter distance Tuesday. Hard/ intervals Wednesday longer Thursday intervals but not as hard as Tuesday - maybe progressive run day Fri. Rest or easy Sat. Intervals Sunday long run or race I would try to incorporate a rest day every 7-10 days Hope that helps 

Running is harder on your body that walking. This is a pro. It can also, if not addressed correctly, turn into a con. Running will push your muscles, tendons, joints, lungs and heart more than walking will. When you run, your feet will hit the ground harder, your muscles will contract faster and with more force, your lungs will need to supply more air, and your heart will need to distribute blood faster. Basically, your entire body will be working harder - which is a good thing! It will force your body to adapt and improve to meet the new challenge. However, if you've never run before, or haven't run in a long time, there is a danger of overdoing things, especially if you 'jump in the deep end.' Start off slow - maybe 1 mile at a time at an easy pace, and see how it feels. Don't just try to run 3 miles a day during the first week - your body won't be ready for such a drastic change. Make sure you have good shoes, make sure your technique is decent. Otherwise overuse injuries will inevitably happen. If you ever have pain that is not normal soreness, take a break. Don't try to fight an injury - this is counterproductive. Overall, I would say running is a great and logical next step after walking. Like I mentioned before, it will improve the fitness of all the parts of your body, more than walking will. BUT, remember to be smart about it, and listen to your body. Ease into it, and you'll be fine. Good luck! 

Muscle growth actually occurs during the recover phase. Ie when you work a muscle hard, you create small tears In the muscle fibre. When it recovers, it recovers a bit stronger? I believe DOMS is a good indicator of a good workout. It's okay to train whilst suffering with DOMS, but try to work a different muscle group to allow for the recovery repair stage to happen. Getting the blood flowing round the body is good to help sore muscles, as is gentle stretching. However, do make sure you incorporate 1 rest day a week into your programme. For mental and physical recovery, and for growth to occur 

In my opinion the furthest I would go in training pre marathon is about 22 miles. And I would only do 1 of these. The rest of the long runs I would suggest should be between 18-20 miles. The reason I say this, is that running the full 26 miles takes a lot out of you, and I think would have a negative affect on the actual marathon rather than a positive. I think a 22 is okay, as it's in the last few miles that you would hit the wall(if you were going to). You definitely don't want this to happen in training. Doing a 22 will give you the confidence that you can do the distance, which is why I would suggest you do one. I can't see any reason for doing 3 x's 10 miles. Do you really have the time to do that in one day? Also, a reason for not doing 3 x 10 is that when you do the very long runs your body has to learn to use fat as fuel. If you do 3 x's 10 you wouldn't get this benefit. I hope that helps. Btw I don't understand the last bit of your question - how does this translate to race time? 

Is there a hard bump there that hurts when you press on it? If so, it could be Osgood Schlatter's. Actually, even if there isn't a bump yet, it could still be this. On the other hand, if the pain is in the tendon attached to the kneecap, it could be Jumper's Knee. Either way, as Dave said, make sure your squat form is perfect, BEFORE you go heavy. If you're squatting right, there will be no joint pain, only possible muscle soreness. I had Osgood Schlatters a while ago; it seemed it was because I wasn't sitting back in my squat enough. If you don't sit back on your heels and take the force of the squat in your glutes and hamstrings, all the force goes into your quads and knees. You should be taking barely any weight on your quads at the bottom of a squat; your core should be tight, and your glutes and hams should be TIGHT, taking the weight. Concentrate on feeling that tension in your glutes, ready to explode the weight upward. If you read the Stronglifts "how to squat" article I think he explains it pretty well. 

I would say do all of what you mentioned! If your sport is soccer, do sprints AND endurance training. Not on the same day, though. A sprint workout will tax your muscles' explosive capabilities and especially your nervous system. You want to stay away from fatigue, as the goal is to teach your body and brain how to move at the highest speed possible. Sprint practice on sluggish legs doesn't do this. You want full recovery in between sprints. On the other hand, a long running workout should be focused on building your endurance at a pace that is sustainable for long enough that you actually do reach your endurance limits. If you're running too fast, you won't reach that limit. I like to think about endurance as running at a pace where you can get "in the zone," where you can go for a loooong time (think a 90 minute soccer match). Sport specific training, then, would be where it all comes together. Doing all the springs and 5-mile runs in the world won't help if you can't dribble or pass the ball! But, they will help you elevate your game to a new level as your sport-specific skills progress. Basically, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to do all of the things you talked about. But, make sure that each training session has a goal in mind - if you're doing a sprint workout, the goal is speed! So don't tire out your legs. And if you're going for distance, the goal is endurance - so run at a pace that you can sustain to reach true endurance limits. 

Are you doing pressups every day? If so, it may be that the muscles are fatigued. Muscles actually become stronger during the recovery process. So if you haven't had a day off for awhile, try that. Otherwise, I'd agree with @LarrisaGodzilla 

No. If your fastest pace for 1 mile is 5.30. Unfortunately the further you go the pace will drop off. There's various websites that will predict your race times based on other distances, ie I guess it works out your potential. Here's one $URL$ You can help reduce the drop of pace by interval training and a long run a week, but you can't stop it 

Well done on getting to the gym if you are feeling like this. I would suggest a couple of things. Try to get out for a daily walk, getting some fresh air will make you feel more energised. You didn't say whether of not you are working, if not, try to find a hobby, or set yourself a goal for fitness or something else you can be working towards. If this doesn't improve soon, go back to your Doctor. It's not normal to feel like this all the time. I'm no Doctor, but you could be depressed. Try to help yourself, and if that doesn't work, keep going back to the doctors until you get some answers.
