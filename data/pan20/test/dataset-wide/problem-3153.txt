A footnote on page 30 of this document says that the date of Virginia's ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment (which abolished slavery) was on the 9th of February, 1865. (If I recall correctly, that makes it nine days after Congress proposed the amendment.) On February 9, 1865, the war was still underway. Of whom did the legislature that passed the ratification consist? Surely not Confederates? 

If I'm not mistaken, universities in Europe originated in the middle ages. Today, the way of making new discoveries known to the learned community is publication in scholarly journals, or more recently, things like the arXiv (which is only lightly refereed, so scholarly journals are still the main thing). What means of making new findings known to learned people in general were used in the middle ages? (I have wondered whether the reason why medieval Norsemen who visited North American were not credited with its "discovery" is that they did not avail themselves of such means.) 

In November 1782 the Preliminary Articles of Peace between Britain and the United States were signed. They specified where the boundaries of the United States were. I have two questions: (1) Did anybody ever attempt to define the boundaries of the United States before that? (2) Vermont was included within the boundaries. Some things about this are crystal-clear: 

One often hears of "the thirteen colonies", and of course the colonies were also called "provinces". Were they also sometimes called "states" before the Continental Congress convened? 

In the early 19th century it was, and for a long time had been, illegal for apprentices to resign. A "runaway apprentice" could be arrested and returned to his master, to continue working for room and board and instruction until he was 21. Hiring someone else's runaway apprentice was a tort under the law, and the rightful master would sue the illicit employer and be awarded money damages. On the web I find it asserted that in the early 19th century, two teenagers from Boston signed on as crewmen aboard a ship bound for China, and it is hinted that some illegalities were involved, and I suspect they were runaway apprentices. The story goes on to say that two years later when the ship returned to Boston, one of these two had risen to the position of captain of the ship. That makes me suspect there was a violent encounter along the way, perhaps in Polynesia, resulting in the deaths of the captain and some other officers. I don't want to include a link to the story since it would give away spoilers to a novel inspired by this episode. Is it possible to locate the story of what happened based on this much information? Spoiler below: 

At the beginning of July 1788, the unicameral Congress of the Confederation began deliberations on whether to admit the proposed new state of Kentucky to the Union. Under the Articles of Confederation, each of the thirteen states could cast one vote on each measure in Congress, and nine states were needed to admit a state to the Union. Kentucky was a part of Virginia and the legislature of Virginia had consented to making it a separate state. Congress's deliberations were interrupted by a notification that New Hampshire had just become the ninth state to ratify the proposed new Constitution, so that it became effective in the ratifying states. They passed a resolution saying it would be "unadvisable" to admit a new state under those circumstances. That it would have opened some major cans of worms can be seen when one considers that the new Constitution named the thirteen states and not any new states, and said how many representatives each would have in Congress until the census data became available, without mentioning any new states, and granted to the new bicameral Congress the power to admit new states. Alexander Hamilton, then a member of the legislature of New York, predicted in 1788 that one of the first things to be done by the new bicameral Congress the following year would be the admission of Kentucky to the Union. He used that as one of his arguments in favor of New York's renouncing its disputed claim to sovereignty over Vermont and consenting to Vermont's admission to the Union, so the the additional southern representation in the Senate would be balanced by additional northern representation. But Congress did not admit Kentucky to the Union in 1789. Why not? One guess would be that maybe they were too busy. They had to write all the new federal laws, approve appointments to every federal judgeship on the Supreme Court and all lower federal courts, decide which departments would exist in the executive branch and approve appointments to head them, approve appointments of ambassadors, etc. But that's just a guess. And in 1790 they still didn't admit Kentucky. In February 1791 they decided to admit Kentucky and Vermont. The act admitting Kentucky was passed two weeks before the act admitting Vermont, but it provided that Kentucky would not be admitted until well over a year later, whereas Vermont was admitted just two weeks after the bill was passed. So why did they wait until 1791 to admit Kentucky? 

In an disorganized way I have been reading various things about the 18th-century history of Vermont and I wondered whether their way of choosing and installing governors was unique, or the same as what was done in other states, or to what degree it was similar. Both during Vermont's years as an independent country and during the years immediately following, elections for legislators and for governor were held each year in October. Then the legislators assembled in whichever town was serving that year as the place where they meet. The governor whose one-year term was about to end presided over the opening of the legislative session. The legislature's first order of business was to count the votes for governor. That took all day. When the total was known, if one candidate out-polled all others combined, then that person, if present, got sworn in as governor and then presided over the rest of the legislature's session. If no one had a majority (as happened in 1789) then the legislature chose someone to serve as governor. Apparently the governor's term did not end on a pre-specified calendar date, but rather whenever the process of electing his successor was complete and the successor was sworn in. If the successor was not present (as happened in 1790) then the outgoing governor continued to preside until his arrival. My question is to what extent all this resembled or did not resemble the processes used in other states? (To clear away possible confusions, I should add that Thomas Chittenden was elected every October from 1778 through 1788, and then again from 1790 to 1796. He died in August 1797 with about seven weeks left of his term. Moses Robinson was governor from October 1789 to October 1790. Vermont's admission to the Union on March 4, 1791 happened during Chittenden's first term after his comeback. Vermont's admission did not interrupt his term, nor those of any other officers of the state; the 1786 Constitution of Vermont simply continued in effect.) (Chittenden was also elected in March 1778 as the first-ever governor of Vermont, it having been decided that thereafter legislative sessions, and therefore governors' terms, would begin in October.) 

One must surmise that one reason why the American diplomats in Paris felt they had to insist on the inclusion of Vermont within the boundaries of the U.S.A. was that one of the thirteen states claimed Vermont, and the peace negotiations in Paris were no occasion to make decisions about that particular dispute, nor about the boundaries of Vermont. So my question is: What, if anything, was actually said about Vermont during the deliberations and negotiations in Paris? 

It is sometimes complained that nothing is considered to have been "discovered" until a white man learns of it. Thus Columbus "discovered" America, and Livingstone "discovered" Lake Victoria. I have a tentative hypothesis that what is really happening is that things are considered to have been "discovered" when the findings are published in scholarly journals, or in earlier centuries were made known to the community of learned people by other means. (I don't know how this was done in late medieval or early renaissance times. I think Columbus wrote a book or two.) For example, I heard it asserted by a professor of education that the idea that students are responsible for learning was first proposed in the 1990s. But I think no sensible person could doubt that that idea has prevailed for as many centuries as there have been students and teachers. However, it was "discovered" when it began to be considered in the scholarly literature of the professor's field. Can the discipline of history help decide between my tentative hypothesis and that in the subject line of this question? 

In 1785 Vermont was a de-facto independent country that was unrecognized largely because the government of New York adamantly insisted that Vermont was legally part of New York (as King George III had ruled it was, in 1764). It is asserted on this page that that unrecognized state conducted a census in 1785, and has some links to data (for example this page lists heads of households in Ferrisburgh Township who were enumerated in that census. But this page asserts "No Vermont State Census Records are known to exist."
