Mont Forel, Greenland's tallest peak, can be found in coordinates 66.9333° North and 36.8167° West The Arctic Ocean's average depth is 3406 feet, 17,880 feet maximum The maximum width of the Atlantic Ocean is 4,000 miles 

There seems to be a connection between orbital revolution (one year) and distance from the star the body orbits. For example, Earth orbits the sun at a distance of 93 million miles and completes one revolution every 365 days. This alternate Earth has a longer calendar--372 days per revolution. That is pretty much 31 days on all of the twelve months of the modern calendar, including February. How far would Earth orbit the sun at this calendar? And would it pose any difference on how bright daylight is? 

...dried it up. The key to this question is that with a major body of land reduced to land, passage is open for animals to colonize new lands. Turning lots of water into land is, at first, the most convenient. The thing is, the Crisis happened only once. Once the waters from the Atlantic broke through Gibraltar, the Mediterranean stayed a sea for the last five million years. For the sake of animal migration, in an alternate universe, should it make sense for the Mediterranean drying up only to refill with water to be a cyclical event, preferably earlier than seven million years? Or should I stick to travel via wind and rafts, as had often happened more than once? 

The History Channel program Life After People focuses on how civilization would fare if humans instantly vanished. One episode says that one hour after people, unattended oil refineries blow up in flames. Another episode says that simple gas leaks are enough to turn residential neighborhoods like Levittown, New York, into raging infernos. Yet the show does not cover the fate of humanity's primary fossil fuel--coal. When humans instantly disappear (how they did is not relevant to the show or the question), what fate will befall the coal factories? 

This second brown line is the alternate Alps, the point where the Balkan Peninsula has been colliding with mainland Europe for 30 million years. The tallest is 18,510 feet above sea level and still rising. North of the brown line is plateau. With these two fictional plateau situated very close to a lot of moisture, would I expect them to behave exactly like Tibet does? 

We're not 100% sure why Old World empires were so huge and New World empires so small, but a good guess is that the Old World took advantage of a mammal called Equus ferus--the horse. Horses had been used as draft animals, long-distance carriers and war weapons. The horse used to be a triumph of New World evolution, but the Younger Dryas climate chaos 13,000-11,000 years ago drove the Western Horse into extinction, so the horse could not be a source of New World cavalry. The Younger Dryas also drove to extinction another American originality--the camel. In this alternate history scenario, the Younger Dryas still happened, and it still drove the American horses into extinction, antelopes--real and pronghorn--never existed, but camels still thrived in North America. Questions follow: 

This question is inspired by a premise from the video game Batman: Arkham City, in which a portion of Gotham City has been closed down by the public to be reserved for prisoners from such places as Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary. Unfortunately, that was only a temporary environment, as the real agenda, codenamed "Protocol 10", was to cull Gotham's excessive population. The context in this scenario is different. In the near-future, some global or near-global disaster has forced the construction of multiple Shimizu Megacity Pyramids, Ultima Towers and X-Seeds 4000, arcological structures that are supposed to support great populations with minimal area space. Which means that any of the old cities, like New York, Tokyo, Beijing, Sydney, Houston, Detroit, Chicago, London and many others, would be viewed as undesirable by the public, thus converting these old cities from public settlements to extra-extra-large prison colonies. Provided that extra security measures be done--like filling the outside spaces with walls--could converting a large, metropolitan complex into a prison be feasible, much less wise? For further clarification, physical feasibility is the only target in this question. Whatever happens inside--gang wars, survival struggles, other kinds of social unrest--is not the point. 

If an arboreal city on the scale of Lothlorien is possible to use in real life, how would the three issues listed above be addressed? 

The official definition of "stainless steel" is a steel alloy where 10.5% consists of chromium, allowing it to withstand corrosion a lot better than carbon steel. With this sort of advantage, you'd expect to see stainless steel being the very bones of a skyscraper's skeleton. But skyscrapers consist of regular carbon steel rather than stainless. Why is that? Why don't we see stainless steel being used to build skyscrapers? 

Afrotheria Recent molecular evidence has found that this superorder is exclusive to elephants, sengis, aardvarks, tenrecs, hyraxes and sea cows. But the connection, as far as I know, is strictly genetic, not visible to the naked eye or the process of fossilization. In order for the whales of this alternate Earth to evolve from ancient afrotheres, should anything in their skeleton change shape and/or size to confirm that connection, or would the differences be strictly genetic? 

The Icelandic horse has its own characteristic--an extra gait more energy-saving and comfortable than the other four (gallop, canter, walk, trot). This ambling gait made the Icelandic horse a popular breed for use by Middle Age travelers. So by breeding Icelandics and Yakutians together, I have made a small but strong horse able to both withstand every environmental extreme and amble comfortably over long distances. True or false? 

If it weren't for materialistic impracticality, the Japanese today would have been busy building the next largest pyramid--the Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid, which was planned to be built over Tokyo Bay. The plan was 6575 feet tall and an area of eight square miles. The people of ancient Egypt always considered their pharaohs to be living gods, so would it be possible for an ancient pyramid to be as big as Shimizu to put emphasis on that belief? Even with the interior diagram presented here instead of the arcological skeleton that the Japanese were planning, would it be practical to even try? 

Finding online forums on the really big picture of worldbuilding--geography, geology, climatology, meteorology, ecology, glaciology--has proven to be very tedious with very few rewards. It is crucial for me that before I make any embellishments set in my fictional world, I need to create a believable alternate Earth first. (Magic, fantasy and mythology count as embellishments.) Do you know any discussion forums online that allow hard-science on speculative scenarios of the earth-science disciplines listed above? 

Skull Small (at least in proportion to the rest of the body); Peg-shaped teeth used to strip down leaves; No mechanism to make chewing possible 

Its diameter is 2.6x greater than Earth's, and its mass exceeds Earth's by seven times. Its atmosphere is thicker than Earth's (but nowhere near as much as Venus') and consists not of carbon dioxide, but instead oxygen, hydrogen, helium, methane and water vapor. Nonetheless, its distance from the sun is the same--141.6 million miles. Are these changes enough for Mars' water supply to be full-on liquid? 

Since my Great Lakes Earth scenario isn't going well, I'd might as well go back to something simpler. Non-human hominids are prevalent in European mythology--elves, dwarves, giants, etc. So the scenario is, if any of them are in Pleistocene environments and categorized as "archaic humans", what kind of habitats would each race be suited for? 

Marked in brown are mountains. Marked in red or orange are plateaus or cracks from ancient lava flows. Marked in black are lands that don't physically exist in this world. The best way to create these maps realistically is via Google Maps. But is it possible? Is there a program on Google Earths where I can alter the geography, geology and topography of the Earth to my whim? 

One of the most infamous elements of science fiction is genetic engineering. Numerous times in the Star Trek universe, genetic engineering has been depicted as resulting in trouble and therefore branded as illegal. In the comic book universes, genetic engineering was usually at the hands of dubious, secretive scientific teams. So conventional science fiction portrays the pain of genetic engineering as legal and societal. But what about physical pain? If a healthy adult has been injected with genetic engineering for whatever reason, will he suffer physical pain of any sort? 

This is a skeleton of a titanosaur, not quite the longest of the dinosaurs, but most certainly the heaviest! As far as we have found, we'd found no species exceeding 75 tons. This post focuses on a neat piece of evolution called "convergent evolution", in which an unrelated species evolves similar features to deal with similar if not identical circumstances. But before we get to the one sole candidate I have in mind, let's look at the bones that made sauropods both famous and infamous among the human culture: 

Now in order to survive in a latitude where the summers are short and the winters bitterly cold, these boreal bamboos may have to grow more slowly--like, instead of six weeks to reach the maximum height of 100 feet, it happens in six years. Is this change in adaptation enough for bamboo forests to thrive in subpolar latitudes, or should more changes in characteristics be required? 

If any one of these have been bred to serve humans in the sixth or seventh millennium BCE, would we still breed cattle, sheep and goats along with them, or would the domesticated deer fill all three niches at once? 

Now let's say that the giant, as a species, does exist and grow no bigger than Mr. Wadlow. What kinds of anatomical differences from ours would they need to deal with the listed problems? 

It's not as tightly packed as ancestral concrete, meaning it's more porous It's fitted with steel reinforcement bars for better durability, higher relative strength and higher tolerance of tensile stress. 

In this alternate scenario, five million years ago, a mass extinction hit Earth. Not a massive volcanic eruption or a devastating bolide impact, but a sudden cold snap, a transition from Miocene hothouse to Pleistocene icehouse geologically quicker than a human can say "Hi." Half of all terrestrial species would perish in this catastrophe, and life confined to the pantropics (strictly tropical, with no other considerations of habitat) would be hit hardest. Five tropical plant species out of eight would become extinct, taking a lot of the most specialized invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals with them. The most possible result of this aftermath are plants and animals from the subtropics (like Florida, South Africa, southern China and the Mediterranean coast) migrating to and colonizing the tropics. Now the only difference I know between tropics and subtropics is that subtropical ecosystems are seasonal (wet/dry cycles), whereas tropical ecosystems usually aren't. But is that the only difference between the two merely similar zones? Or are there other differences that I should look out for? 

In this alternate Earth, Arabia is a mere extension of northeastern Africa, erasing both the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off the map. Also, the mountains are arranged differently. The Atlas Mountains still stand by the Sahara’s northwestern coast, but they are taller — the tallest peak being 21,810 feet above the level of the sea, 1500 feet taller than Denali. Outlining the coasts of Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Yemen and Oman is a range of volcanic mountains called the Aden Bahçesi. Its highest peak stands 24,341 feet above sea level, 1500 feet higher than Aconcagua back home. All of Africa’s rivers originate from those two mountain ranges. Now let's take the possible effects of civilization into account. Would these changes create larger civilizations, perhaps even full-blown empires (at least before the Macedonians and Romans marched along)?
