Rather than propose that it has a different structure I think it's best to say that it has the same structure: two clauses. 

No, your example sentence is ungrammatical in English because the rules of English require that all singular countable nouns have some sort of determiner. 

All of these are ungrammatical which is strong evidence that these that phrases are not noun phrases. 

This is of course highly debated, but some linguists would answer yes, there is a small set of words/concepts common to all natural human languages. The major theory currently representing this view is the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, which posits that there are around 66 core 'semantic primes' which are both irreducible and universal. These primes are usually words, but some will in some languages be expressed by affixes or set phrases. 

Suau (Austronesian, PNG) has a particle indicating a continuing action, which is phonetically a long /e/ which can last for as long as a couple of seconds, and is written simply as eee--. 

MIT's OpenCourseWare has a large number of linguistics courses. The are many on language theory and analysis (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics) and some on NLP. 

Mood is most frequently used to refer to a morphological system (or a syntactic one). The Mood system will mark modality, but it also often marks other semantic categories as well, such as illocutionary force (i.e. interrogative, imperative). This is the same as how languages frequently mix tense and aspect together in their morphology. Or often languages will mix tense and modality or aspect and modality. So having two terms for mood and modality could actually be a helpful thing: if you hear "modality" then the topic will most likely be about realis/irrealis etc, but if you hear "mood" then get prepared for subjunctives and optatives. Mood could be considered to be a morphological category while modality is a semantic category. 

English doesn't have a "pluperfect tense", so it couldn't have come from anything. English has two tenses: past and non-past. It has a progressive aspect marker (-ing) and a perfect construction (have). The various "tenses" like the "pluperfect" just arise naturally from the various combinations of those elements. I'm not sure what the origin of the English perfect construction is, but in general, it is definitely true that grammatical features including tense change. For example, you can look at Wikipedia's summary of Old English verbs, which had distinct morphological forms for infinitives, subjunctives and imperatives, none of which exist now in Modern English. 

Most recently developed orthographies are phonemically straight forward - they become less ideal as time goes on and the spoken language goes under sound shifts, but the written language doesn't. Most of the languages SIL has worked with did not have an orthography before, so you'll be able to find many in their archive. 

At first, some important remarks on animacy. Animacy is more like a continuum, meaning that it doesn't behave like a dichotomy (animate or inanimate) but rather "a more or less continuous category ranging from most animate to least animate" (Croft 2003: 130), cf. Dixon's animacy hierarchy, human < animate < inanimate. This is semantic animacy or what Croft calls "animacy proper." Obviously, it is language-specific. For example, trees are inanimate in Slavic languages whereas they are animate in Algonquian languages (Plungian 2011: 142, n.47). Interesting examples from Russian: trup 'a dead body' [inanimate] pokojnik or mertvets 'a dead person' [animate] (from Plungian) A Wikipedia article on animacy (its Russian version) aslo mentions cases when the same noun can be both animate and inanimate (with no difference in meaning), e.g. virus 'virus' or robot 'robot'. Some examples from Dyirbal (Dixon 1972) non-human animates: some birds, moon, storms, rainbow, boomerangs, some spears, etc. Now, to make things more complicated, this semantic animacy interacts with many other things, like definiteness, referentiality etc. (the extended animacy hierarchy). See Croft for further discussion 

Tons of research has been written on the problem of distinguishing between verbal passives and adjectival passives, e.g. "The vase was broken." The following is a summary of Ward, Birner and Huddleston 2002. They mention a number of tests for English - try to see if they work in German. It can be considered an adjective if it passes more than one of any of the tests below: 

As for OE beginnan, two explanations are possible. 1. Scandinavian influence (Dieter Kastovsky, e.g. Kastovsky 1992 specifically mentions OE beginnan): However, there is no direct evidence to support this hypothesis but we may have some indirect evidence. First, even though we can find OE beginnan, another verb was much more common – OE onginnan, until it was superseded by ME beginnen around the fourteenth century. An interesting similar case could be the development of OE ongean (> PDE again). The ODEE (ed. Onions, 1966) says “the native forms in aȝ-, ay- did not survive beyond XVI, being superseded universally by forms in ag-, derived from Scand. and appearing first in northern and eastern texts XIII.” More information about the chronology of this change could come from the development of OE giefan (> PDE give). The ODEE mentions that the non-patalal variant appears c.1200 and that the regular ME forms yive, yeve etc. “prevailed in southern and midland writings till XV.” So, the remark by darkgamma that "the etymology is off and the chronology is wrong by a few hundred years" is irrelevant. However, the biggest problem is the apparent lack of a Scandinavian (Old Norse) cognate, and I'm by no means the first linguist to notice this. 2. (Analogical) leveling: However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this, either. We have to remember that even though it is “inherently irregular,” it is a “fairly systematic process” (Hock and Joseph 2009: 152; emphasis mine - Alex B.), which means we should be able to find other examples – very few but they should be out there. Cf. Hogg 1992 “with the degree of allomorphic variation noted in §7.41, it would be expected that there should be considerable analogical levelling and extension” (Hogg 1992/2011: 269) and later he claims that “[a]mongst strong verbs there appear not to be clear-cut examples [of analogical levelling – Alex B.] in OE” (p. 270; emphasis mine - Alex B.). However, in our case this would contradict the directionality of Mańczak’s seventh tendency of analogy, which states that “the forms of the present more often bring about the reshaping of other tenses than vice versa” (as cited in Campbell 2013: 265). Examples of levelling (strong verbs, West Saxon): OE gyllan – geal – gullon, cf. PDE yell (yelled) OE gyldan – geald – guldon, cf. PDE yield (yielded) Also, the analogical levelling hypthesis cannot explain why OE onginnan > ME aginnen was superseded by ME beginnen. To conclude, as Pons-Sanz 2015 writes, "In the end, it is up to the linguist’s judgement and his / her willingness to accept the Norse derivation of a term without a formal Norse imprint that determines whether or not it will make it to the list of medieval English words with a Norse etymon. This, of course, is a serious problem for historical linguistics, given the central place of many Norse-derived terms in the English language." 

The "Natural" in Natural Semantic Metalanguage is intended to contrast with other semantic metalanguages which use non-linguistic symbols and syntax. Here's an example, which apparently is describing the semantics of have to: 

Yes there are many languages. For example the Oceanic languages are often very regular in their inflections. A single example is the language Kakabai, from Milne Bay, PNG. Kakabai has a set of suffixes which are used to construct all the pronouns, while also marking inalienable possession on nouns. Here are the pronominal markers (exc=exclusive, inc=inclusive, Food=possessive pronoun for food noun class): 

BEFORE (in the limited sense of a temporal comparison) is one of the Semantic Primes of the Natural Semantic Metalanguage. Though NSM researchers have not considered every language in existence, they have studied languages from every large family, so I'd consider this decent evidence that this is something every language will have. Note that the primes may be represent by affixes or phrases rather than just single words. 

Yes there are other ways of constructing questions. Many Australian languages use a verbal auxiliary which carries some modal meaning, to which they then attach subject and object agreement clitics. The Walmajarri language changes the auxiliary to create polar questions (source, p93): 

While the others are correct that the normal description is that participles are "verbal adjectives" (an unhelpful and almost meaningless explanation in my opinion), it is worth noting that participles can also be used substantivally, i.e., as a nominal in its own right. So in Greek ὁ λεγων means 'the one who is speaking' or 'the speaking one', and the same happens in English with gerunds like the happening. We should expect this across languages all around the world. There are two primary word classes: nouns and verbs; generally the more time-stable and the more time-variable. Some languages have distinct modifier classes like adjectives and adverbs, but many do not, with those modifiers being formally in the noun or verb class. Word derivation can change the class of words. Participles and infinitives are two ways in which the variability of a verb is decreased or removed, so that a verb which meant an action gets turned into a word which conveys the idea of the action. The idea of an action is then used as a modifier for either a noun or a verb, but just as with other modifiers, it can then also be used by itself as a nominal in its own right. 

Each of these categories will have dozens of options when you look at all the world's languages, though an individual language will usually only have a few, if it marks the category at all. The things you list in your question are just some of the inflections you'll see, and some of them wouldn't even normally be considered to be inflections, as they are derivational! 

Interestingly, this entry hasn't been included in Fowler-4 (Butterfield 2015). cf. Michaelis and Jones 1913 or Jones 1917 give one variant only, with [aɪ]. For some reason, it's missing in Walker 1859. Chambers 1861 lists hygiene, with other variants hygieina, hygieine (all with [aɪ]?). 

Basically, when you're not sure which linguistic units you're dealing with (be it phonemes, morphemes etc.) or it is irrelevant to your research, you use the word "segment". Sometimes, it is used for style, to avoid repetition. Thus, a segment is "any element, at any level of representation, which is described as forming sequences with others" (Matthews 2007). "Segment: A result of linguistic analysis that attempts to isolate minimal linguistic units, such as phones, morphs, syllables, from a language or speech continuum." (Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics) In structural linguistics, you would start with segmenting some linear language continuum into chunks (segments) by applying different operations such as substitution etc. Caveat: in some American intro linguistics textbooks, a segment is incorrectly defined as a speech sound (phone) only. 

There are several common terms in use, e.g. monomorphemic or simplex words, and polymorphemic or complex words; cf. the screenshot below from The Oxford Handbook of the Word (from the article written by Geert Booij): 

At first, some general remarks on comparison and terminology. My answer is mostly based on Pierluigi Cuzzolin's research. Let's start with some definition of comparison. Cuzzolin and Lehmann 2004 give the following definition: "Taken as a grammatical category, comparison (German Steigerung) is the formal modification of some predicative word – most often an adjective – representing a parameter of gradation or comparison, according to the extent to which it applies to its argument, relative to some standard" (p. 1212). Thus, comparison as a grammatical category includes "semantic" comparison (relative) and gradation (absolute). Any comparison must contain at least the following three elements: the comparee, the parameter (a cognitively salient feature), and the parameter marker (a morpheme expressing a degree). Secondly, Heine has a nice table on types of comparison. Naturally, there is some variation in terminology - but this is irrelevant here. 

This is unusual but possible. For example, Christa König argues that in Ik, a Kouliak language spoken in Uganda, nearly all lexical items can be case-inflected. See examples (48)-(50) on p. 155 in Coding participant marking: Construction types in twelve African languages or have a look at König 2009 in The Oxford handbook of case: 

Note that a word doesn’t need to pass all of those three tests to be considered a determinative – e.g. “one” doesn’t pass the first test (the one problem that remains). Quite often the same word can belong to both word classes, adjectives and determinatives, e.g. “sufficient”. sufficient as a determinative: ?the sufficient helpers sufficient of helpers sufficient as an adjective: a sufficient reason I think that “said” may behave like a determinative in legalese in writings of certain people (in whose idiolect "said note" is fine but "the said note" is not) - if there are such writers. However, in this case you’d have to address the following two questions: How consistent are those writers in omitting articles before “said” followed by a singular count noun? Is "the said" followed by an NP ungrammatical in their idiolect? Do you want to have the same word belong to different word classes in different registers in your theory of syntax? I personally would say yes to the second question. As Walter Bisang argues, there are languages where “lexical items are not necessarily preclassified for syntactic categories” (Bisang 2011: 293).
