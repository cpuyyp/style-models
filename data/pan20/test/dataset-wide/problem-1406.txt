What is ??!?? You use the abbreviation/term everywhere in your code, but to anyone without a doctorate, this might not be clear. 

Retrieve salt and hashed field from database. Prefix field with salt. Use hashing algorithm on it. Compare the result of that with hashed field from database. 

You're really right. If someone sent me the fullscreen fiddle link, I'd ask what I'm playing. Not to mention, it doesn't even fit (for me) on the fiddle link entirely, I have to scroll down. Instead of using fixed width, use percentages or media queries. On the subject of your actual design, and not the size of the page: You could redo it a little better, for example, with a cards table placed in the background, and you deal the cards onto it. Or something similar. 

Instead of , you can evoke directly on the nodelist, as long as you attach the additional call to . I would suggest to remember that for cases where you make frequent document retrieval calls, simplifying document calls comes in very handy: For example, one of my simplifications for jQuery-like selection: 

Indentation: You're missing indentation in your code, you should space out each level of indentation. For example: 

Removing I mentioned this to you in chat, but if you do a quick for sitename you can expand this script out to any site supported by the API. 

You don't need to compare properties to booleans as simply specifying the variable without comparison performs a boolean comparison: 

Number 1: So, seeing as content inside a is optional, as shown above, you can "merge" cases, like the following: 

I try not to suggest ternaries very often, but I believe that could be simplified with the use of one. 

You shouldn't be having actual data hardcoded in, pass it in from a database or config file for better maintainability. 

Please don't put comments inside your for statement, the line before or after is the place for those: 

The keys in seem a little superfluous, you can just use a general array there, with array indexes instead. 

It looks like you keep as an integers like the suggests, but use strings, as the suggests. If you do measure solely in integers, you ought to change the database type. 

I've written a small script to enable the vote count viewing functionality that comes for users at 1k reputation: 

In another function you use a style item as a parameter, so I would suggest removing and staying consistent. 

seems like it could use a better name. As I found out, shouldn't be used other than for the system function/methods, so avoid naming it that. 

Like @200_success said, you should be caching your results, so that way, when you keeping increasing, you won't have to recalculate every thing over and over. 

Why are you using the structure? Just use a normal statement loop. Don't have the statement on the same line as other code, that's just saving the few bytes of a new line at the sake of readability. Also, include some whitespace between the in the definition of . Both the and the blocks have one thing in common, returning the state of , so you should factorise this out, and make it so it runs after s case has been executed. All together: 

When you're redacting the keyword by comma, you need to finish with a semicolon. Also, in your spacing is wrong. You don't need extraneous space in your brackets, and you should have a single whitespace after your commas. Also, is unused, so it can be removed. 

However, Number 2: is a catch-all of sorts, anything that isn't declared as a above is caught by , so not declaring and is the same as declaring them in this case. Depending on how you feel about readability, you could make it look like: 

You have a lot of extraneous lines, I would try to avoid that, really only leaving lines when necessary. 

should be , and you shouldn't use for single line comments, and you even have an superfluous after . is for multiline comments, and only then would you use a per line. 

I would also suggest removing jQuery from the solution as well. , (the element fetching), and can be polyfilled in, or simply converted to vanilla JavaScript. 

I don't particularly understand why you have double underlines in , and to answer your question: you could declare it as a variable if you like, but it really wouldn't matter either way. I think is a bad name for a CSS class as it's, basically the content of the class. 

You're redefining (literally pointless) You don't need to define with the others, define it on the second line. 

When selecting values that correspond to Unique fields referenced by constants (), you're only really selecting one field, meaning this is redundant. 

and then similarly to before, you can assign values inside the chain, and call the functions like . Additionally, this allows you to use a constructor, in case you want to build different game instances, like: 

I wrote a pretty basic setup script that handles most of the setup for a Three-server solution. The solution and setup file are available on GitHub The three servers are Redis, HAProxy and Node / Cron. All three options handle only solution specific stuff (not including installing the frameworks) I felt like my usage of statements was a little over the top, and newline as a constant seemed a little hacky, but nonetheless, it works. 

The shortside to ternaries is that you sacrifice readability for effectiveness. However, if you can move past that, ternaries are an effective part of a Programmer's Toolbelt(TM) 

Your code looks really nice, and as I am unfamiliar with the framework you are coding for, my review is somewhat limited, nonetheless, I'll try my best. 

Your code shouldn't be accessable from the Console. I would recommend using getters and setters to limit incorrect addition: 

It seems the value you're trying to replace for is really just the prefixed by , so just string concatenate them together. However, if some of the replace variables do not follow this pattern, it'd be best to use @ratchet freak's solution. 

You're not actually mapping anything. The map function is passed in, but you don't actually use it. If you changed to , then you would be mapping something. Your code will error, if any of the items in parent array aren't arrays, because you attached your function to the . 

Like Chat.SE, the pinging system could be implemented, similarly with a sound, and highlighted name. And similarly with Chat.SE, giving the server chat a special colour like mods have on Chat.SE would be nice, otherwise I trouble-makers might be tempted to sign up with 'Server Chat 2' as a username and confuse everyone. 

: In the above point's code, you never actually use , as it is the second parameter, it can be entirely removed, JavaScript does not require an explicit amount of parameters. 

Also, (could have a better name), runs nearly the same code as , you could consider a compromise between the two functions. 

That certainly slimmed down, didn't it? When displaying content built from variables or arrays, make sure you consider how you choose to return them to the client. 

The first one is missing whitespace between the operators, and the second one should have the statement on a new line.
