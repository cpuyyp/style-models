This is not a complete solution, but it is a way to compute things in sort-of a nice way. The module $U$ has a complementary module $U^\perp$, and the kernel of a generic module map $F:X \to U^\perp$ is isomorphic to $U$. Then you can look at the restriction $F:X_S \to U^\perp$ and try to compute its generic rank. This puts things as close as possible to linear algebra, because $F$ comes from a linear family of linear maps. The first question is whether there is any anomalous intersection, which amounts to asking whether $F$ has maximal rank, which amounts to computing the full minors of $F$. Each maximal minor simply corresponds to restricting to $X_T$ for a subset $T \subseteq S$ such that $|T| = \dim U^\perp$. This is simply the statement that $$\dim (X_S \cap V) - \dim (X_T \cap V) \le \dim X_S - \dim X_T,$$ which is true solely because $X_T$ is a subspace of $X_S$. You ask about certain special cases in which $U$ comes from a permutation representation $H/c$, and $U^\perp$ is thus induced from the sign representation $c = -1$. In such a case, the matrix of $F$ has a simple form in which each entry is a single variable, and the variables are negated or repeated across entries. For example, if $H = S_3$ and $c$ is a transposition, then I get $$F = \begin{pmatrix} x & -y & -x & z & y & -z \\ y & -x & -z & x & z & -y \\ z & -z & -y & y & x & -x \end{pmatrix}$$ for all of $X$. We are interested in determinants and ranks of minors of this matrix, and evidently we can remove all of the minus signs without changing any answers. This is explained by the fact that $c$ is complemented by the alternating group and we can tensor $X$ by the sign representation to switch $U$ with $U^\perp$. For the same reason, we can switch $U$ and $U^\perp$ for the dihedral cases as well, because $c$ is complemented by a subgroup of index 2. Then $F$ becomes a generic module map between two permutation representations of $H$; each matrix entry of such an $F$ is a single variable. It is easy to check that for the example of $S_3$ and $c$ a transposition, every full minor has the property that one of three variables ($x$, $y$, or $z$) is a transversal. This is a sufficient condition for that minor to be generically non-zero. So, there are no anomalous generic intersections for this $H$ and this $U$. If $c$ is central, then the matrix of $F$ has repeated columns. Obviously, if a minor of $F$ has repeated columns, then it vanishes. But this is not the only way to get an anomalous generic intersection. For instance, if $H = D_4$ and $c$ is a reflection, then (if you switch from $U = X^{c=1}$ to $U = X^{c=-1}$ as I argued you can), you get the matrix $$F = \begin{pmatrix} x & y & z & w & x & y & z & w \\ w & x & y & z & y & z & w & x \\ z & w & x & y & z & w & x & y \\ y & z & w & x & w & x & y & z \end{pmatrix}$$ The odd-numbered columns are a vanishing minor. The reason is that the vector $$(1, 0, 1, 0,-1, 0, -1, 0)$$ is always in $V$. So, although I certainly don't have a complete solution, I can find examples of $S$ where there isn't an anomalous intersection (because one of the variables is a transversal), and examples where there is an anomalous intersection (because every admissible $V$ contains the same vector in $X_S$). And, this formulation of the problem makes it easier to check a given $S$ by computer. 

From the preview page of Garnir's Dream Spaces with Hamel Bases, by Norbert Brunner [Arch. Math. Logik 26 (1987), 123-126]: "The situation changes completely, if one drops AC and instead assumes e.g. the axiom determinacy AD plus the principle of dependent choices DC. Then every linear map $A:X \to Y$ from a Banach space $X$ into a normed space $Y$ is continuous." (Brunner then says that Garnir establishes this from a weaker hypothesis.) Also, Wikipedia tells me that the axiom of dependent choice implies countable choice, and countable choice implies that every infinite set has a countably infinite subset. If $\ell^\infty$ (or any other infinite-dimensional Banach space $X$) has a Hamel basis, this contradicts the above setup. A Hamel basis for an infinite-dimensional Banach space $X$ is infinite, and assuming a countably infinite subset, you can make an unbounded and therefore discontinuous linear map from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$. (This topic is not my business at all, but maybe I am right as a naive student.) 

I am looking at a paper by Pascal Koiran on the computational complexity of certifying the solvability of integer polynomial equations in several variables. With the aid of some important theorems in algebraic geometry, Koiran reduces everything to the following univariate question: Suppose that $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a polynomial of degree $D$, and suppose that the $\ell_1$ norm of the coefficients (or the $\ell_\infty$ norm or anything in between; they are all equivalent for this purpose) is bounded by $R$. Then it is a theorem of Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Weinberger that there is a prime $$p = \exp(\text{poly}(\log D,\log R))$$ modulo which $f$ has a root. The only catch is that they assume the generalized Riemann hypothesis. It could be somewhat easier to prove that there is a prime power $q$ of this size and a root in $\mathbb{F}_q$. That seems just as good in context, but in any case there is a prime $p$ that does the job. This theorem is closely related to the "effective Chebotarev density theorem" of Lagarias, Odlyzko, et al. Koiran needs an ample supply of such primes, but my question is about just finding one. My hunch at the moment is that it is still an open problem to find a $p$ in the range given above unconditionally, in particular without GRH. What is the current status of the question? Could it be easier just to find a root than to establish full effective existential Chebotarev (rather than the density result), or are these equivalent results? Is it viewed as difficult for the same reasons that GRH is difficult, or is GRH just one possible approach? (By the way, you can get an interesting but inadequate bound unconditionally as follows: $f(x)$ only attains a unit value at most $2D$ times, so choose some other $x$ with $|x| \le D$ and then pick a prime divisor of $f(x)$.) 

This is not a solution, but ideally a clarification of the question. The semigroup $\mathbb{Z}_+$ under addition is equivalent to the semigroup $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^\infty$ under addition. We are interested in certain special subsets $A_n$ of the latter, which in multiplicative form correspond to $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Each $A_n$ is a certain $n$-element lower set in the natural partial ordering on $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^\infty$. We would like to color $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^\infty$ with $n$ colors such that each translate of $A_n$ uses $n$ different colors. By a compactness argument, we can find a sequence of translates of $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}^\infty$ in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that the colorings converge to a coloring of all of $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$. In other words, in multiplicative form, we could equally well have asked the question in $\mathbb{Q}_+$ as in $\mathbb{Z}_+$. Also, I think that the subset of $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ with color 1 is a set of vectors that yields a tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ by translates of $-A_n$. For instance, if two of these translates intersect at $x$, then you correspondingly $x+A_n$ contains two elements with color 1. (Technically this only shows that it is a packing, not a tiling. However, the cracks that are not tiled must have density 0, and you can translate them away by the same compactness argument.) Moreover, if you have such a tiling, then you can color each element of each tile in the same way, and then for that coloring each translate $x+A_n$ has all different colors. Again, in multiplicative form, you're tiling the positive rational numbers by arithmetic progressions $a,2a,3a,\ldots,na$. 

I am not entirely sure what you should do. But, at least at many American math departments, I can make two suggestions for what I wouldn't do: 

The question is seems ill-posed, because you can always make a small deformation of a lattice to send the kissing number to zero. Even if you expand the spheres as much as possible, the kissing number will generically be 2. Even if you require linearly independent kissing points, then I think that generically there will only be 2n of them. You could look at unimodular lattices. By definition, this is a lattice such that if you write the Euclidean dot product in a basis of the lattice, its matrix has integer entries and determinant 1. If you drop either determinant 1 or integer entries, you're back to the deformation instability. There are only finitely many unimodular lattices in any fixed dimension, and not very many in low dimensions. I don't know the behavior of unimodular kissing numbers in high dimensions. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be two closed, 2-dimensional, non-positively-curved Riemannian disks (not necessarily with convex boundary). Suppose that their boundaries $\partial A$ and $\partial B$ have the same length, and identify $\partial A$ with $\partial B$ with a length-preserving diffeomorphism of circles. Suppose also that for every pair of points $p,q \in \partial A = \partial B$, there is a distance inequality $d_A(p,q) \le d_B(p,q)$. Does it follow that the area of $A$ is less than or equal to the area of $B$, with equality only when $A$ and $B$ are isometric? This is a variation of a question that arose in a joint paper that I am trying to finish. Another version which is more relevant to the paper is about $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ disks which are tiled by Euclidean unit equilateral triangles. 

As for knots and links: In order for $U(\mathfrak{g})$ to have a non-trivial deformation as a Hopf algebra, you have to allow comultiplication to be non-commutative, even though $U(\mathfrak{g})$ itself is cocommutative. So then if $V$ and $W$ are two representations, $V \otimes W$ and $W \otimes V$ are not isomorphic via the usual switching map $v \otimes w \mapsto w \otimes v$, because that switching map is not in the category. (Due to non-cocommutativity, it is not equivariant, i.e., not an intertwiner.) However, $V \otimes W$ and $W \otimes V$ are still isomorphic, just by an adjusted version of the switching map. (You see the same theme in the category of super vector spaces, where there is a sign correction when $v$ and $w$ both have odd degree.) However, there are two natural, in-category deformations of the switching map, not just one. It so happens that they should be interpreted as left- and right- half twists in a braid group, so that you get braid representations and ultimately knot and link invariants. The point is that ordinary tensors (and tensor networks) live in spaces that have natural actions of symmetric groups, because you can permute indices of tensors. The whole theme of quantum group definitions is deformations, and it so happens that the symmetric group action deforms into a braid group action. This explains topological invariants such as the Jones polynomial in a one- and two-dimensional sort of way, from braids to diagrams of knots to knots themselves. It is more satisfying to have a more intrinsically 3-dimensional definition. (Actually, what counts as intrinsically 3-dimensional is somewhat debatable, but never mind that.) This is why Witten provided a "definition" of the Jones polynomial and related invariants using Chern-Simons quantum field theory. It is not really a rigorous definition, but it is very credible as a "physics definition" or even an incomplete, but maybe one-day rigorous, mathematical definition. This leads to the basic association between Chern-Simons quantum field theory and quantum groups, that they are two ways to describe the same topological invariants. 

Counterexample: $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\ 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\ 1/2 & 1/2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$ The question is of interest in quantum probability. Your map from unitary matrices to doubly stochastic matrices defines an interesting region which has non-zero volume, and which cannot be convex because it visits all of the vertices. 

The main interpretation, which is fundamental in quantum information theory, is that the transpose of a UCP map $E$ is a linear map on quantum states that represents a realistic information channel. This is the correct generalization of a Markov map or a stochastic map in classical probability theory. Such a map $E^T$ has to be linear, or otherwise it violates superposition of classical probabilities. $E$ has to be unital, or otherwise $E^T$ does not conserve total probability. It has to be positive, or otherwise negative probabilities can be created. It has to be completely positive, or otherwise $E$ tensored with doing nothing on a companion system is not positive. Then Stinespring's theorem says that the necessary conditions can be interpreted as sufficient for $E^T$ to be realistic. There is also the Choi isomorphism theorem that identifies CP (but not UCP) maps between two systems with positive states on one system. This is also important, but much more secondary. The category of $C^*$-algebras with UCP maps as the morphisms, and with the arrows reversed to express the transpose, is a realistic category of quantum probability. 

As found by Gjergji, a list compiled by James Dow Allen (except for a later Fields Medalist tacked on at the end): (1854-1912) Poincaré (1862-1943) Hilbert (1864-1909) Minkowski (1865-1963) Hadamard (1875-1941) Lebesgue (1877-1947) Hardy (1879-1955) Einstein (1881-1966) Brouwer (1882-1935) Noether (1885-1955) Weyl (1885-1977) Littlewood (1887-1920) Ramanujan (1892-1945) Banach (1903-1957) von Neumann (1903-1987) Kolmogorov (1906-1978) Gödel (1906-1998) Weil (1913-1996) Erdős This is already not bad. Maybe people can offer improved versions of this starting point. (I personally would both add and subtract from this list.) 

Nicolas Destainville [arXiv:cond-mat/0101413] suggests that the "coupling from the past" algorithm can efficiently produce an exactly uniformly random rhombus tiling of any zonogon with integer side lengths. There is no general formula because it is understood that the number isn't "round" (i.e., a product of small factors, especially one that potentially yields a $q$-analogue). However, it was discovered experimentally that the number of tilings of an $(a,b,1,1)$ octagon is round, and this was proven by Elnitsky in the reference that you cited. An entropy model of the tilings, including the question of just approximating the number of tilings, is a really good question that I suspect is open. My evidence for this is that the general entropy study for hexagons is non-trivial even though it is solved. The full answer is that a random tiling has an inscribed Arctic ellipse with saturated entropy only in the very the center. I guess the first important paper on this ellipse is the one by Cohn, Larsen, and Propp [arXiv:math/9801059]. There is another interesting interpretation of these tilings (which you might already know). They are discrete minimal surfaces in the cubical lattice in $\mathbb{R}^g$. You can use this interpretation to prove that they are all connected by hexagon moves. Finally, a pet peeve: The Kasteleyn method is not fundamentally different from the Gessel-Viennot method [arXiv:math/9810091]. There will never be a counting problem in which one method applies and some version of the other method does not. The matrices of the two methods are always equivalent in the sense of $K$-theory, i.e., up to integer changes of basis and stabilization. 

As I read the question, much of it amounts to, what is an abstract Lie group and what is exponentiation in a Lie group. To review, an abstract Lie group is a smooth manifold with a smooth group law, and its Lie algebra is the tangent space at the identity. The Lie bracket comes from the second derivative of the group commutator $ABA^{-1}B^{-1}$ and associativity of the group implies the Jacobi identity for its Lie algebra. For the rest I will only take finite-dimensional Lie algebras and finite-dimensional representations. Now, you can have real or complex Lie groups and real or complex Lie algebras. Every real Lie algebra has a complexification with identical structure constants. For that reason, you may not see any distinction between a Lie algebra and its complexification in a physics treatment. But the distinction is very important, because the topology of complex Lie groups is better behaved. Note that you can also realify a Lie group or a Lie algebra, which does not change it as a set; but its real dimension is then twice its complex dimension. There is a converse theorem that every Lie algebra integrates to an abstract Lie group. If you like, you can take it to be the universal cover, the one which is simply connected. Ado's theorem says that every Lie algebra has a faithful matrix representation. (Per the other MathOverflow question, you can make the Lie group a closed set in that faithful Lie algebra representation.) Every compact, real Lie group has a faithful, closed representation, and I suppose that every complex, simply connected Lie group has a faithful, closed, complex representation. But not every real, simply connected Lie group has a faithful representation. An important example is $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. It has the homotopy type of a circle and therefore an infinite cyclic universal cover, but none of its cover have a faithful matrix representation. If you complexify to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, then it becomes simply connected. Another important fact is that the fundamental group of a Lie group is always abelian and lifts to a subgroup of the center of its universal cover. If the center of a Lie group is a discrete subgroup, then you can divide by it to obtain a miminal Lie group model of that Lie algebra, the model that is the most rolled up. Among the faithful representations of a real Lie algebra, I think that there is always one in which the Lie group has been unrolled as much as possible. Even without knowing that one representation, you can simply say that two points in a Lie group are equivalent if they are equal in all representations, and quotient by this equivalence. I don't know if this intermediate cover has a special name.
