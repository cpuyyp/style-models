Wouldn't a plausible explanation be "the only one in your list which even exhibits this is the anthropocentric one." 

You, a gentleman from the 1800s, discover a strange flat silver box, with a hinge at the front (or so it appears form the image of a fruit on the lid). $URL$ Under the lid, where you might expect to see a tray of chocolates, you see a tray of letters and symbols, randomly arranged. Perhaps you recognize the alphabet, but if so, it is scrambled, and placed in the middle of the tray, facing away from the hinge. The letters appear fixed in place - trying to remove one with your fingers, it pops down as if on springs. They could be mechanical buttons, but none, at first glance, appear functional. If you have experience with typewriters, you might intuitively get the concept of keys; otherwise, you will at least understand the concept of buttons and an alphabet. Below the buttons is a faint recess, such as one might rest a small lithographic print or business card into, but unfortunately there is none there: it is empty. At the sides are various holes of various shapes, five on one side and three on the other. One looks like a coinslot, the others are squarish and go in to various depths, some having golden metal springs within. On further investigation, one button, the one on the top-right, appears to be a toggle, making an illuminated image of a beach appear and disappear from the inside of the lid. When the beach is shown, so too is a small rectangle in the middle of that picture, containing the text "enter password". Most of the buttons at that point add a dot to the box, the exceptions being: 

One commonly given reason is to eat them. That is, to be awakened/brought back, requires a sacrifice. The blood of an X, a receptacle body to inhabit, a wife, the life force of another in order to give enough energy to materialize, whatever. The evil bad guy is not able to awaken without this, so cannot kill the X on his own. In some cases (wife, inhabitable body, nonfatal blood donation) the sacrifice might be a willing minion; otherwise, it's someone the minions catch and drag in. Either way, there's an unavoidable dependence on minion loyalty. 

Consider how we interact with ants. One way we interact with ants is through surrogates. Watch a child investigating ants. He mostly doesn't poke them directly. Instead, he pokes them with a blade of grass, perhaps with a dead ant on the end, trying to get the two ants to "talk". He changes the ant's environment by removing its trail, and sometimes by moving it away from its familiar environment to a jar or tupperware container. In visual storytelling, this is usually represented by a blank white void or white room, as you see in 2001, the Matrix, etc. Don't do that. But it's important to remember that despite being ineffable to us, we may be equally inscrutable to the God - it may not even know we exist, nor, on knowing, might it have the least clue what our thoughts or beliefs are. But if it did want to communicate, it would communicate on our level, by changing our environment, or poking us with sticks. So, an Avatar or angel - a collection of whatever crap the god found around, crafted into some form of approximation for us. It might or might not be able to communicate with us. Most likely, if we were inscrutable to the God, it'd just make the avatar do stuff and see how we reacted. Eventually, a God interested enough to put the work into it, would be able to understand us, especially if we made an effort to communicate back, just as we can understand the basics of animal communication (back off! I'm hungry! I'm scared! I'm wounded! etc). The swirl of floating rocks and twigs would become more formed as the God understood us and our desires better. It might become an angelic statue. It might be a friendly or sexy human like thing. It might become a computer screen and keyboard. It might become a a rapidly descending shoe to stomp us out when it gets bored. 

Given a (reasonable) bit of luck, The solar system will still be recognisable. There will be five naked-eye visible planets whose orbital periods will be remarkably similar to ours. Oner heck of a co-incidence, if it's somewhere else! Use of a telescope will reveal Uranus and Neptune, and the sizes of the five planets, and their major moons, once again pretty similar to our Solar system. Mars will almost certainly still be red; Olympus Mons and other major features largely unchanged. Earth's day will be longer, but its year will be only slightly so. The Moon will be considerably further away and "smaller", but like Mars it will look much the same. (There's no reasonable natural way for it to vanish, that doesn't wipe out life on Earth at the same time it does). Why "with a reasonable bit of luck"? Because all orbital mechanics with more than two bodies is mathematically chaotic. There is no guarantee that orbits within the Solar system won't change dramatically in the far future, possibly with the result of one or more planets smaller than Jupiter being expelled into interstellar space. Best observational data and computer modelling says the current arrangement is stable for about 200M years, so no cause for panic. Beyond that, we can say nothing, because the model is "sensitive to initial conditions" inside the error bounds of the observations. Fossils may be another give-away, but after a billion years, plate tectonics will have subducted most of the sedimentary rock formed in the present day. More likely indicators will be seen from biology and biochemistry. The genetic code of life will still use the same codons for the same bases. The major enzymes shared by all life will still be the same, modulo accumulated mutations which do not damage the functions (because any damage to the fundamental mechanisms of life, will result in death at a very early stage). Biology will supply similar clues at a higher level. For example, mammalian (and bird, reptile) eyes have a "design defect". The blind spot, where the optic nerve connects to the retina. The same compound eye design evolved independantly in molluscs (octopuses and squids), minus this defect. There will probably still be recognisable mammals, birds, reptiles and squid. There are many similar "design defects" which once evolution has taken a particular track, are "designed in" and cannot evolve out except by extiction of a whole branch of the tree of life and re-evolution of some similar organism from a different branch. That has not happened often over the last 600 Myears. I've ignored the problems others have pointed out. A billion years it too far in the future: the sun will have become so hot that unless chaotic orbital mechanics provides a miracle, the Earth will by then be dead. Half a billion years, and the Earth will probably be hotter, dryer, but still habitable. Suspended animation for that time is surely impossible. It might be more plausible to employ handwavium. Maybe a prototype warp drive malfunctions, and instead of crossing light-years in an instant, it merely provides a one-way jump to the future. (ISTR Larry Niven(?) wrote something similar as a short story ... it was a passenger spaceship with a faulty drive). 

Security experts recommend "Defense in depth", and "Multi-layer security". Plus, it makes the system more interesting to describe to the reader. So you could use several different devices or systems to achieve all your ends. While all a bit scifi-esque, here are some ideas at least a little less of a hand-wave than "forcefield". 

In general, it helps to just look at real life. Imagine a robot which, even as a waldo, could perform all the jobs that humans perform on spacewalks outside the ISS. The robot would cost more, and be more complex, than the ISS. In Star Wars, by far the most complex piece of engineering on the ship was the astromech droid, which is why they were removable and usable for other things. And yet, while he could clearly do some maintenance tasks, R2 could not possibly do all the things necessary to keep a ship in ship shape. Patching it up just enough to fly home on a wing and a prayer, yes; but eventually, it needs to get home into the hangar and be tended by real engineers. If droids are fully sentient and have the same capabilities as humans (as C3-P0 seems to) then perhaps they would be sent out to do it. But wait. Why should the sentient droids always draw the short straw? They are sentient. Shouldn't there be a fair division of labor, rather than treating the droids as disposable drudges? Not only that, but, in the middle of space, a droid is irreplaceable and unrepairable. A human, however, can heal, and even be replaced over time. Androids with all the capabilities of a human must necessarily, just to get to parity with humans in the first place, also have a vast range of mission-critical abilities that humans lack. So the android becomes the most irreplaceable crew member. Why waste it? 

Anyone who's written a story without planning it out well in advance will have encountered this supporting character. They start as just a throwaway, but then they're the obvious one to deliver that hook, they refuse to be made two-dimensional and come up with better ideas than you expected, their presence ties together different plot arcs in much more complex and delightful ways, and they add emotion and depth to the other characters. As they become the main character's best friend, they have the chance (at least in more epic stories) of having the baton passed to them as the main character fades back or dies off. The main character is, by and large, immune to random "accidents", but not to aging, or to becoming seriously wounded in pursuit of their goals. So long as those goals are things which can be completed by another, it's feasible to have the baton passed to a secondary character. 

Yes. The most rational way is if raw magic is a substance associated with certain rare minerals and exploitable by people with certain rare inherited traits after careful training. The magical country sits atop rich seams of raw magic and has a magically inclined population. The other one doesn't. The population thing may be Darwinian: if someone lacking the genetic traits ( and/or training) is tempted to experiment in a high magical field, it is usually fatal to him. I'm tempted by the "cannot use magic on iron" trope. Maybe the non magical country sits atop ironstone which protects it from magical attack and means that it's found its way to an industrial revolution. The magical country has no good iron ore. Hence trade not war. And of course, mages make appallingly bad technologists. They expect to magically impose their will on matter, not to carefully observe matter to see how it would like to be of assistance. Put like that, maybe the non magical country is actually home to a different, subtle sort of magic. 

In a sense, we are life that is based on single units that are larger than atoms and molecules. The units are called cells. This sort of life emerged very suddenly around 600M years ago after two billion years of green and grey slimes. Yes it would be perverse to deny that monocellular organisms are also alive. But therein lies the difficulty. The fundamental building blocks are atoms and simple molecules. That's where evolution has to start. However, there is also the possibility of "scaffolding": an intermediate step which can go extinct after some more evolutionary fit form has evolved from it. It's an open question as to whether there was some form of non-cellular life before cells emerged and wiped it out. There are interesting parallels between clay minerals and RNA. But there is no longer any clay-based life to be found on Earth. So similarly, imagine some intelligent beings evolving from "animals" and discovering themselves and all other "life" to be made out of what we might call small voraciously self-reproducing nanotechnology. Will they ever work out that a good few hundred million years previous, the human race wiped itself out by developing self-reproducing nanotechnology with insufficient restraint and control mechanisms? (An SF grey goo catastrophe). Or, that their once lifeless planet was seeded with nanotechnology by an interstellar probe launched by far-sighted aliens or post-humans? 

Supplementary answer about a special case, an Island Nation Such a nation may not need much of an army to stay secure. What army it has, is to deal with internal security, and it might well go by a different name. What it needs is a good navy and air force, and (in the modern world) excellent shore to ship missile defences. It's then pretty much invasion-proof. If it maintains a policy of strict neutrality and provided it is not blocking any major sea route or global resource, it will be left alone. 15 miles of water kept the UK safe in WW2. (That was a close thing). 150 miles of water would have been 100 times safer, rather than 10. New Zealand is the closest real world example I can think of. (About 1000 miles of water? And Oz is another island nation). Switzerland, being land-locked, needs and maintains a good army, but it is very different to most other ciuntries' armies. Switzerland also follows the policy of neutrality, and geographically it is far easier to move armies around Switzerland rather than through. The Swiss army is trained for guerilla warfare in alpine terrain, should any other army ever invade. The alpine passes are death traps for any invader.
