Mosquitoes thrive in warm and humid climates. It's extremely important to not allow stagnant water near your home. This aids in the reproduction cycle for mosquitoes. If you like to keep bins of water outside to collect rain for your plants, don't do this as the still water is very enticing. I sort of broke off on a tangent there. But back to the question. The climate you want is a very dry climate or very cold. Mosquitoes can't thrive in super dry climates. The reason being there is no area to lay their eggs. During stretches of very dry and hot climates mosquitoes will bite less. The female is the only one that bites, because the protein helps develop the eggs. But in dry weather being hard to find water to lay their eggs, their is no reason to feed on blood. So the biting is much less. But that doesn't mean you will find zero mosquitoes. From here: 

The math is absurdly complicated. There is no way you are going to be able to estimate the tides without substantial geographical and astronomical information. The brackish areas can be especially hard to predict, because their geometry can cause them to have more complicated cycles than the common twice daily cycle. From the Wiki Article on Tides: 

Use Campsuds or something similar, don't bring household soap into the wilderness. The surfactants and phosphates in household soaps will cause more damage to the water supply than the biodegradable soaps like Campsuds. 

If you can climb a ladder, you can start rock climbing. You won't be doing crazy stuff unless you get more practice and go often enough to build strength, but there will be routes you can work on. Where arm strength really matters is overhangs. Unless you're doing those, you'll likely find your hand strength is your limiting factor than your arm strength. Unfortunately hand strength takes longer to develop safely than arm strength. Just go one day and see what you can do. 

This might seem obvious but actually take a close look. Does the tree look like it is in a good upright position? Does it sway wildly with even the slightest breeze? Do the roots appear to be fully in the ground? Does the outside of the tree look like it is leaking any fluid? If so, does the area around it look normal (i.e. no blackish areas or cracking)? These are important factors. A tree that leans to one side obviously has it's center of gravity offset. This could lead to the tree uprooting itself. If the tree is very bulky and doesn't allow the wind to freely move through it, this can drag branches and limbs, which may result in a limb or branch falling off. Walk around the tree and ensure there are no roots that appear to be coming out of the ground. I don't mean ones that you simply can see in the soil, but if it appears the roots are literally rising up out of the ground, this can be a bad sign meaning lots of erosion and loose soil. Finally, if the tree looks like something may be eating it or that it might have a disease, avoid this. These things can make the tree weak at its joints. 

I don't believe such an easy method exists you can keep in your head and calculate. The position of the moon relative to you depends on accurate knowledge of the phase of the moon, time of day, and latitude and longitude of where you are, and those interact in a nonlinear manner. Your original claim isn't even true in all places. The moons rotation is between 18 and 25Â° from the equator, and navigation in there will not always fulfill your claim. If you can see the moon, you should be able to see the stars, at least Polaris (or southern hemisphere equivalent), and that will be a better method and more reliable. 

Cooking raw brats over a fire is only dodgy because cooking brats well requires fairly precise (for a campfire) temperature control. Even with hot dogs, it can be a bit challenging to get the whole thing consistently cooked through without burning the outside. With a bratwurst, its larger size makes that especially difficult without some skill or tools. If you are skilled and patient, you can however cook them over a fire, just like with anything else. However, because of the extra challenge, fully cooked brats and sausages are better. If your fully cooked brats you bought could be eaten right out of the cold package, then you should be fine. As to pork vs other meats, pork was a bit more dangerous than beef because of Trichinosis, however to my knowledge in the developed world it is quite uncommon. This is probably why people in your group had that position. However, other common meats have plenty of other nasty critters in them, so it's debatable whether pork is actually any worse. Much of the danger of a particular meat today is not so much the animal it comes from, but from its preparation. Even chicken meat can be consumed raw if the animal was well cared for and kept free of disease. However, unless you've sourced your meat from a world-class shop, assume it is crawling with dangerous microbes that must be eradicated via cooking, because it almost surely is. Ultimately, all cooking involves the application of heat, so there is nothing that should not be cooked over a campfire, from a safety perspective. You'll just have to learn the techniques of campfire cooking and you'll be able to cook virtually anything. 

Ensure the ground isn't easily broken up. Nice firm, but not too firm, soil will keep the tree firmly in the ground. If the soil is like sand or mushy like a marsh, this could result in the tree uprooting itself due to wind or too much water in the soil. 

At this point it's simply gambling, which is your choice. Again scope out the area. If it looks like trees all fall in one direction, think about where you could place your tent. If in the case a tree does fall, where would you be safe? Is the wind moving in the same direction that it appears the trees fall? That probably means it gets pretty windy and the wind has the ability to push trees over in that direction. The area you are looking in is certainly beautiful. If you decide to camp here, just try to be cautious, scope out the area, and then make a strategic decision. All of my tips are just measures to take, but no guarantees. Sometimes trees will fall over no matter how good they look and how good the soil is around it. Try to find the area with most space and clearing around it. If you decide to camp, hope you have a great time! 

You've got quite a bit of study before you are ready for this kind of voyage. I am not how far off shore "open ocean" means to you, but if it's anything beyond swimming distance to shore, you're going to need more training. What is the kind of boat called? Generally it is called a bareboat charter. To my knowledge, most bareboat charters are for sailboats. I haven't seen powerboat bareboats, but I'm sure they exist somewhere. However, being an absolute beginner, no one is going to rent you a boat in the first place. Driving the boat is the easiest element, and the rental place won't even train you on that, they'll expect you to know how to do that already. The only thing they'll train you on are the novelties and specifics to a particular boat. The main sheet on a rental might be at a different spot than on another boat, so they'll show where that is, but when they point it out to you, they expect you know exactly what that is supposed to do. Training? The training you require for being on the ocean is extensive. Not only do you have to know the basics of sailing, but you also have to know basic engine repairs, navigation, usage of the radios, man overboard procedures, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Territorial waters extend out 12 nautical miles from shore. "International waters" extends beyond that, however partial jurisdiction extends out 200 nautical miles from shore. There will be the coast guard patrolling around out there, but if you run into one of them, they're going to see what you're doing, they're going to board and inspect your vessel for seaworthiness, and they're going to talk to you and quickly recognize you have no business being out there. I don't know what they'll do at that point, but it won't be fun, likely ordering you to shore immediately. Is it safe? There is no risk from pirates in US coastal waters whatsoever. However, the water itself is very dangerous. There have been a lot of people lost at sea throughout history, and even very large and professionally operated ships go down from time to time. The sea is unforgiving. Lastly, on the upside, with many bareboat charter operations, you can hire someone to skipper the boat for you. If being alone on the boat isn't important to you, then you can do that, the hired skipper takes care of all the responsibilities, and all you have to think about is having a good time.
