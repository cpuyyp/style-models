Knower dissapears when "knowing" disappears. How to achieve this? Complicated answer is: with stopping craving. Simple answer is: with calming of the mind and letting go completely. 

Yes. Now you're thinking: "When understanding ceases, I'll fall again into ignorance". No, no my friend. Now you're thinking why? Because: when all phenomena cease, there is no ignorance. Think about it ... How could there be ignorance, if all phenomena ceased?? When all ceases, there is nothing that can be ignorant. Ignorance is like clinging onto an apple with worms inside. You think "Apple with worms is mine". When you destroy the worms, do you have an apple with worms inside? No. Can some other worms return into the apple? Yes. When you destroy the apple that you're so dearly clinging onto it, do you have an apple with worms? No. Can some other worms return into the apple? No, because there is no apple. Thus, you let go of the clinging onto the apple and by letting go of clinging, you let go of the apple. In the same way as clinging onto an "apple with worms", you're holding onto the idea of "self with understanding is mine". You're thinking "Understanding is mine". Now I ask you: When you destroy the 5 skandhas, do you have the 5 skandhas? No. Can some skandha return into that understanding of yours? Yes. When you destroy the understanding that you're so dearly holding onto it, do you have understanding? No. Can some skandha return into the understanding? No, because there is no understanding. Thus, you let go of the clinging onto the understanding and by letting go of clinging, you let go of the understanding. Just like worms in an apple, understanding is a disease, understanding is suffering, understanding should be let go of. This is how a noble one should see understanding: not mine. Thus, he should not hold onto it. But now you think again "If there is no understanding, there is ignorance". Again you're thinking like this because you're holding onto the idea of self. In this case you're again holding onto the idea "Understanding is self". You're holding onto this idea because you're holding onto one or more or a combination of these ideas: "Self exists", "Self does not exist". This is how a noble one should see understanding: not mine. But now you think "If when there is no understanding, there is no ignorance, then there is wisdom.". You're thinking like this because you're holding onto the idea of self. In this case you're holding onto the idea "Wisdom is self". You're holding onto this idea because you're holding onto one or more or a combination of these ideas: "Self exists", "Self does not exist". This is how a noble one should see wisdom: not mine. But now you think "If when there is no understanding, there is no ignorance, there is no wisdom, then there is something." ... Again, this is how a noble one should see something/anything/ALL: not mine. You should let go of ALL ideas. Even of the idea "Self does not exist". In this question you can see the Buddha talking about this "letting go of all ideas": Why is "I have no self" a wrong view? It's because you haven't experienced anatta in its entirety that you're still holding onto ideas about self. Read answers to this question to get ideas how to experience anatta: Can anyone explain non-self or Anatta of Buddhism in simple terms with example? 

There are right views as many as there are beings in the universe. Each has it's own right view. Which view is right? It depends what your goal is. If your goal is to experience the truth and become liberated from future deaths and births, there is only one right view to accomplish this. 

Sound is an object. When the mind directs itself towards an object, that is the experience. What is the experience? Whatever arises when the mind directs itself towards an object. What arises? Senses and consciousness. Then, thoughts. 

It is an accurate translation. Concentration is needed to achieve mindfulness. Thus, it makes sense saying "a concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present". A mindful monk, must be concentrated. There is no other way. Only a very concentrated monk can be mindful enough to discerns things as they actually are present. Maybe study more the difference between the word sati (translated as mindfulness) and samadhi (translated as concentration): $URL$ 

When meditation is not forced, meditation comes spontaneously. When meditation comes spontaneously, awakening comes quickly. When awakening comes quickly, your meditation practice becomes the best practice. Any meditation practice, if not forced, becomes the best practice. There is no one practice better than the other. Choose one, don't force it (or yourself), do it spontaneously and you'll be on your way. 

Yes, but it needs explanation: Any Right Intention, which is not motivated by sensuality, DOES create new kamma. But the newly created kamma, because it is not motivated by sensuality, is wholesome and/or neutral kamma, thus the fruits of this kamma will not create suffering, but will aid the owner of this kamma to more easily remove his ignorance and attain Nibanna. Thus, this kamma helps you in extinguishing your kamma. So correct would be to say: any Right Intention, which is not motivated by sensuality, creates a potential of entering Nibanna, thus ending kamma. So in a way the statement "any Right Intention, which is not motivated by sensuality, doesn't create new kamma" is correct, but it needs to be understood correctly, as I explained. 

Incorrect. Any intention, even if the intention is an intention to end kamma, accumulates kamma. If you have the "intention to end kamma" it will not end kamma, because the "intention to end kamma" comes from ignorance. Whoever thinks that with the sole "intention to end kamma", kamma will end, is not free from ignorance and is bound to suffering in the future. 

Andrew was creating kamma. Was he creating bad kamma? Probably yes. How much bad kamma? We can't know for sure. It all depends why he acted upon his intentions to harm others. Once the cyst was removed, he stopped harming others. Thus, he could see that he acted harmfully due to wrong views, thus, his bad kamma created while he was still having the cyst, has exhausted. 

During ice age we wore animal skin and cuddled near big fires. Before the meteor fell we gathered food and hid in caves. Why? Because of karma. 

You're already doing great. Instead of focusing on achieving Nirvana, focus on smaller steps and forget about Nirvana completely. Meditate upon these questions: How does everything arises and ceases in myself? When you find the answer, progress to the next question: Who am I? And so on...: How everything arises and ceases outside myself? Why does everything arises and ceases? Questions will come and answers will come. Just don't force it. Let go and just let it happen. If you let it happen and it happens, Nirvana will come when you answer all your questions. 

With activities/volition the record of your actions is maintained and kept. How? With activities/volition there arises actions of the mind and body. With the arise of actions, there arises knowledge of Good and Bad. When the body dies, this same knowledge will make the body and mind be reborn again, based on this knowledge. Whenever you're reborn, the whole universe is reborn with all its beings. This your kamma. It is maintained and kept by the universe you experience with your senses. The universe you're reborn in is the result of your kamma and the keeper of your kamma. The universe you're reborn in is the record of your actions. 

Both claims "the soul exists" and "the soul does not exist" are correct, as long as they are not coming from ignorance. According to the Buddha ignorance is having the view "self exists". Thus it follows ... 

Have you, during Buddhist/medidation practice, contemplated sex and realized that you're repulsed by it, disgusted by it, aura dirty when doing it? Or has Buddhist/medidation practice lead you to contemplation of sex and realization that you're repulsed by it, disgusted by it, aura dirty when doing it? If yes, then your repulsion is a symptom of Buddhist/meditation practice. If no, then your repulsion can be a symptom of something else. This doesn't mean that it can't be from Buddhist/meditation practice. It still can be from Buddhist/meditation practice, but it can also be a symptom of something else, completely unrelated to Buddhist/meditation practice. 

Imagine this scenario: A serial killer is pointing his gun at an innocent person John and wants to kill John. An arahant is near the killer and knows that the killer will kill 5 more innocent people after he kills the innocent person John. The arahant can choose to kill the killer before the killer kills John and the other 5 innocent persons. Would the arahant kill the killer? Would a Buddha kill the killer? If yes, why? If no, why? 

Suppose we have this view regarding the child's cause of suffering: "The cause of the child's suffering is in the child's mind" or "The cause of the child's suffering is in the child" or "The cause of the child's suffering is within the child" With such a view, liberation from suffering comes from the child's ability to have control of his mind. With such a view, liberation from suffering comes as already described above. Whenever we are searching for the cause of suffering within us, sooner or later the four noble truths will come to fruition. Whenever we are searching for the cause of suffering outside us, the four noble truths will never come fully to fruition. 

If all three of the above conditions are met, he would avoid to send you out. If only condition 2 and 3 are met, he would send you somewhere else to get help, possibly to some other teacher or on a path that would help you. In any other combination of the above three conditions, the wise would let you go on your own. What else could he do if he sees that he can't help you? What else could he do if he sees that you can't be helped? Or if he sees that you don't want to be helped? 

Suppose you completely empty your mind of all thoughts. You go into complete emptiness of mind, where nothing is arising. Suppose that in that state you make a choice to arise a thought. If in that state a choice is made to arise a thought, "choice" is the arising of "this thought". "Choice" must be arisen before "this thought" is arisen. Is there something that must arise before "choice" in order for "choice" to arise? What did the Buddha say is the first thing that arises that leads to the arising of thoughts? Is the answer to this question in the twelve nidanas: "'mental fermentations/volitions' lead to the arising of thoughts"? $URL$ As I see it, consciousness (vinnana) arises from 'mental fermentations/volitions' (sankhara). Then, from consciousness arise 'name and form' (namarupa), which is constituted of 'matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness' (skandhas). I see skandhas as thoughts. Thus, the first thing that arise is 'mental fermentations/volitions', which leads to the arising of thoughts. Is this correct? 

Thus, you are right in saying: that the 'point of life' is meant to be a journey to stability, satisfaction and self control. Once you realize what is suffering, what is the cause of suffering, what is the end of suffering and what is the way leading to the end of suffering, you will enjoy the fruits of your realizations in this very same life - you will live a stable and satisfactory life, with no ill will, anger, sadness, fears, greed, hatred, envy, any kind of emotional negativity, etc. Once you realize what is suffering, what is the cause of suffering, what is the end of suffering and what is the way leading to the end of suffering, you will live a life completely devoid of any kind of suffering and your death will be completely devoid of any kind of suffering. After death, you'll not be born again - you will be what you truly are. 

Universe houses consciousnesses that arise and cease (because of beings being born and dying) Mind houses consciousnesses that arise and cease (because, according to the teachings, mind contains consciousnesses that arise and cease with every though, recognition, comparison) 

The Buddha cannot get angry. Thus, he never acts upon it. The Buddha is completely liberated from suffering. 

Test 1: open your eyes and look around you. You see trees of green, red roses too, you see them bloom and you think to yourself this is not me. Why do you know "this is not me"? You know because you see them. If these things that you see were you, you wouldn't be able to see them. Think about it ... if the thing you see was you, you would be inside this thing. If you were really inside this thing, how would you be able to see how this thing looks like? You wouldn't. It would be impossible to see how this thing looks like, if you were this thing. You could argue "While being inside this thing, maybe I could create two little holes in this thing and look myself in the mirror?". Again, if you were to do that and you saw yourself in the mirror, you would know that what you saw in the mirror is not you! Why? Same as before: if the thing you see was you, you wouldn't be able to see it. In the same way you throw a ball away from you and see it flying and know "this ball is not me", you see things already thrown away from you and know "these things are not me". Thus, you see trees of green, red roses too, you see them bloom and you know "this is not me". Test 2: Close your eyes and in your mind visualize a tree. In your mind you will see a tree and you will know this is not you. Why do you know "this is not me"? You know because you see it. If what you visualize in your mind were you, you wouldn't be able to see your visualization. (read above in Test 1 as I already explained this) In the same way you throw a ball away from you and see it flying and know "this ball is not me", you see visualized things thrown in your mind and know "these visualized things are not me". Thus, you see a visualization of a tree in your mind and know "this is not me". Test 3: Go to a haunted house in the middle of the night. Sit in a dark room and close your eyes. Sooner or later you'll become scared and you will know this is not you. Why will you know "this is not me"? You will know because you would perceive fear. If the fear you perceive were you, you wouldn't be able to perceive the fear! In the same way an "apple" is just an "apple" and is not "an apple and a mouse", "you" are just "you" and not "you and the perceived fear". Think about it ... If an "apple" were the same as "an apple and a mouse", there wouldn't be any differences between the "apple" and "an apple and a mouse" ... they would be both completely the same, thus you wouldn't perceive the "mouse"! But you do perceive the "mouse", thus they are not the same: an "apple" is an "apple" and "an apple with a mouse" is different than the "apple" in the way that "an apple with a mouse" has a "mouse" near the apple. Thus, an "apple" is not "an apple and a mouse". In the same way, if "you" were the same as "you and the perceived fear", there wouldn't be any differences between "you" and "you and the perceived fear" ... they would be both completely the same, thus you wouldn't perceive the "fear"! But you do perceive the "fear", thus "you" and "fear" are not the same: "you" is "you" and "you perceiving fear" is different than "you" in the way that "you perceiving fear" has "fear" near "you". Thus, "you" is not "perceived fear". Test 4: Close your eyes and think about anything you wish. A sound, an idea, a feeling, a thought, a sensation, ... No matter what you will think about, you will know this is not you. Why will you know "this is not me"? For the same reasons you know that fear is not you. (read above: Test 3) Test 5: Close your eyes and think about "you". You will know this is not you. Why will you know "this is not me"? For the same reasons you know that fear is not you. (read above: Test 3)
