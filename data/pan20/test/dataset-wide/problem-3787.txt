While I am able to verify the second claim, am not able to verify the first one? How is it true? If this can be done, the rest of the proof is straight forward. I am looking for a rigorous proof. Read this if you are interested to know where this proof heads. Now do the stepwise algorithm earlier with inputs $X_1$ and $A$ to get $x_2$ and $X_2$ such that \begin{align}X_2&=X_1-x_2x_2^T\\&=X-x_1x_1^T-x_2x_2^T\end{align} and $$x_2^TAx_2=\frac{1}{r-1}trace(AX_1)=\frac{1}{r}trace(AX)$$ Then the result of the paper is that you can do this procedure $r$ times and get a rank-one decomposition $$X=\sum_{i=1}^{r}x_ix_i^T$$ with the property $$x_i^TAx_i\,=\,\frac{1}{r}trace(AX),~\forall i$$for any given psd X with rank $r$ and any symmetrix $A$. 

Consider $K$ vectors $x_1,\dots,x_K$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Define the $K\times K$ matrix $A$ whose $(i,j)$ entry is given as $$A_{ij}=\exp(-\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{2})$$ Is this matrix Positive Semi-Definite? 

This question arose out of mere curiosity. Given a polynomial equation and I happen to know that its roots are real (but not the roots itself). Does it mean it is the characteristic equation of a Hermitian matrix? And if that is the case, could I just find the hermitian matrix and solve for its eigenvalues?. When I thought about it, looks like determining the hermitian matrix from the polynomial equation looks like a daunting task. Any thoughts on this? 

The generalization looks like this $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \binom{n}{\alpha x}^l dx =\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty\binom{n}{\alpha k}^l,\quad 0<\alpha\le 2/l,~l\in\mathbb{N}\tag{1} $$ where $n$ need not be an integer. The general theorem is given for example in the paper Surprising sinc sums and integrals. Below I give the general outline of the proof which is based on the well known fact that the following function is band limited (its Fourier transform has limited spectrum) $$g(x)=\binom{n}{x}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (1+e^{i \omega})^n e^{- ix\omega} d\omega$$ One can see that Fourier transform is limited to frequencies $|\omega|<\pi$. Whenever spectrum of a function $f(x)$ is limited to frequencies $|\omega|<2\pi$ one expects that $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx =\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty f(k). $$ Now the Fourier transform of $g(\alpha x)^l$ has a spectrum limited in the band $|\omega|<\pi\alpha l$. This is easy to see calculating Fourier transform $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(\alpha x)^le^{-ikx}dx $$ with the help of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-ikx}dx=2\pi\delta(k)$, where $\delta$ is delta function. The general theorem from the paper cited above now states that $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(\alpha x)^l dx =\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty g(\alpha k)^l,\quad 0<\pi\alpha l\le 2\pi,~l\in\mathbb{N}, $$ which is equivalent to (1). All this analysis also explains that when $\alpha=1$ the proposed identity holds for $l=1,2$ but not for larger $l\in\mathbb{N}$. 

Consider two $N \times N$ hermitian indefinite matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$. Consider their affine combination \begin{align} M(t)=(1-t)A_1+tA_2 \end{align} I am interested in the minimum eigenvalue of $M(t)$. I can write this as \begin{align} \lambda(t)=\min_{x ~\in~\mathbb{C}^{N\times 1}}~&x^HM(t)x \\\ &x^{H}x = 1 \end{align} When I simulated this, I made the following observations 

I would like to know the other cases where $\mathbb{S}$ is convex. Can some body point me to known references? 

Let $\mathbf{A}_1,\dots,\mathbf{A}_L$ be $N\times N$ hermitian matrices. Define the mapping from the $N-$dimensional unit sphere to $\mathbb{R}^L$ as \begin{align} \mathcal{S}=\{\left(\mathbf{u}^H\mathbf{A}_1\mathbf{u},\dots,\mathbf{u}^H\mathbf{A}_L\mathbf{u}\right)\in\mathbb{R}^L\mid \mathbf{u}^H\mathbf{u}=1\} \end{align} $\mathcal{S}$ is defined as the joint numerical range of matrices $\mathbf{A}_i$. Let $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{S}$, so that $\mathbf{x}=[x_1,\dots,x_L]^T$ is a $L\times 1$ real vector and $x_i=\mathbf{u}^H\mathbf{A}_i\mathbf{u}$ for some $\mathbf{u}$ from unit sphere. Consider the optimization problem \begin{align} \min_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{S}}~&f_0(\mathbf{x}) \\ \text{subject to}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&~~f_k(\mathbf{x})\leq 0,~~k=1,\dots,K \end{align} where all $f_0(.),\dots,f_K(.)$ are affine functions of $\mathbf{x}$. Is this a convex optimization problem? How do I approach it? Actually, I would like to address the more complicated case where $f_k(.)$ are all convex functions of $\mathbf{x}$. However any direction in this regard is also fine? 

First of all this has nothing to do with the inflection point of $e^{-\alpha x^2}$. According to Poisson summation formula (see Whittaker, Watson, Modern analysis, chapter 21.51) $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha (x-n)^2}=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}\left(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}\cos2\pi n x\right),\quad \text{Re}~\alpha>0.\tag{1} $$ From this formula one can see that when $\alpha>0$ is small, the Fourier coefficients $a_n=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}$ of the resulting function decreases rapidly with increasing $n$. When $\alpha=1/2$ one has $$ \frac{a_1}{a_0}=2e^{-2\pi^2}\approx 5.4\times 10^{-9}. $$ I don't know any conceptual explanation for this in mathematics, but there is such an explanation that comes from physics. Consider a quantum particle with mass $m$ on a ring of radius $a$. We assume the ring is pierced with magnetic flux $\phi$. We want to calculate partition function of this system at temperature $T>0$ in two different ways. On the one hand, it is known that the energy spectrum of the particle is given by $$ E_n=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}\left(n+\frac{\phi}{\phi_0}\right)^2, $$ where $\phi_0$ is the so called magnetic flux quantum. Then partition function is given as the Gibbs sum $$ Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-E_n/T}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2T}\left(n+{\phi}/{\phi_0}\right)^2}.\tag{2} $$ Here one immediately recognizes the sum analogous to the LHS of $(1)$. On the other hand, partition function is related to the trace of the density matrix $\rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$, i.e. to $\int\rho_{\theta,\theta}d\theta$. It is possible to calculate the density matrix of this system in imaginary time representation by solving a certain differential equation. Details of this calculation can be found for example in this book, chapter 4.3. Consider first the more simple case of unbounded line $-\infty<\theta<+\infty$; then the answer is $$ \rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}=Ce^{-\frac{mTa^2(\theta_1-\theta_2)^2}{2\hbar^2}}, $$ where $C$ is some normalization constant. Magnetic flux does not enter this expression because there is not any nontrivial loop in the system. On a ring there is a nontrivial loop, and let $n$ be the winding number. It is known that the partition function is a sum over all homotopy classes multiplied by corresponding phase factor. In this case the phase factor comes from the magnetic flux (Aharonov-Bohm phase) and equals $e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}$. As a result we have \begin{align} Z&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}\int\rho_{\theta,\theta+2\pi n}d\theta\\ &=2\pi C \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{2\pi^2mTa^2}{\hbar^2}n^2+2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}.\tag{3} \end{align} Combining $(2)$ and $(3)$ one obtains the transformation in $(1)$. One can see from this physical interpretation that when the temperature $T$ increases, then the higher Fourier harmonics decrease. This corresponds to the physical intuition that the higher the temperature the more chaotic the system becomes and the effect of the Aharonov-Bohm phase averages out due to thermal fluctuations. 

Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be a symmetric $N\times N$ real matrix and $N\times 1$ real vector respectively. Then consider the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined as \begin{align} \mathbb{S}=\{\left(\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{u}\right)\in\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{u}=1\} \end{align} That $\mathbb{S}$ is bounded is obvious. I was wondering if it had any other properties. In particular I am looking at convexity, similar to numerical ranges. If not, what are the conditions on $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ for the convexity and so on. Motivation: Consider the optimization problem \begin{align} &\min_{\mathbf{u}\in \mathbb{R}^N}\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{u} \\\ \mbox{subject to }\\\ &\mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{u}=1 \end{align} Then using the definition of $\mathbb{S}$ as earlier, I can write the above problem as \begin{align} \min_{(x,y)\in\mathbb{S}}x+y \end{align} Thus if $\mathbb{S}$ is convex, the above problem will be convex. 

Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be two complex rank-one $N\times N$ positive semi-definite matrices. Let the matrix $\mathbf{C}$ be defined as \begin{align} \mathbf{C}=\left(\mathbf{I}*\frac{1}{\alpha}+\mathbf{B}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{A}\left(\mathbf{I}*\frac{1}{\alpha}+\mathbf{B}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} \end{align} where $\mathbf{I}$ is the $N\times N$ identity matrix, $\alpha$ is a positive variable. The question is to find the $\alpha$ which maximizes the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{C}$. Background: This comes from a real world wireless problem where the largest eigenvalue represents the best power allocation at the transmitter. $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ represent the channel matrices. 

Any references regarding these infinite products are welcomed. If the question is not clear please ask in the comments and I will clarify it. Note. Q2 has been answered, however Q1 is still open. 

Using the integral representation of Bernoulli numbers I obtain formally the integral representation of the double summation $$ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j}\frac{B_{j+k+1}}{j+k+1}=2\cdot\int_0^\infty\frac{t}{e^{2 \pi t}-1}\frac{dt}{t^2+(1+t^2)^2}=0.069591059035995961110566767049... $$ So the alternative form of the question is $$ \int_0^\infty\frac{t}{e^{2 \pi t}-1}\frac{dt}{t^2+(1+t^2)^2}=\frac14+\frac{\ln\phi}{1-2\phi} $$ $\it{Proof}.$ Since $$ \frac{1}{t^2+(1+t^2)^2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac1{t^2+1/\phi^2}-\frac1{t^2+\phi^2}\right), $$ and according to Binet's second integral representation for the digamma function $\psi$ $$ \psi(\phi)=-\frac1{2\phi}+\ln\phi-2\int_0^\infty\frac{t}{e^{2 \pi t}-1}\frac{dt}{t^2+\phi^2}, $$ $$ \psi(1/\phi)=-\frac{\phi}{2}-\ln\phi-2\int_0^\infty\frac{t}{e^{2 \pi t}-1}\frac{dt}{t^2+1/\phi^2}, $$ and $$ \psi(\phi)-\psi(1/\phi)=\frac1{\phi-1} $$ one has \begin{align} &\int_0^\infty\frac{t}{e^{2 \pi t}-1}\frac{dt}{t^2+(1+t^2)^2}\\ &=\frac1{2\sqrt5}\left(\psi(\phi)-\psi(1/\phi)+\frac1{2\phi}-\frac{\phi}2-2\ln\phi\right)\\ &=\frac14+\frac{\ln\phi}{1-2\phi}. \end{align} 

$\bf{Step~1}.$ $B_{n,a}(q)=B_{n,n-a}(q)$. $\it{Proof}$. Write $$ \sum_{n\geq1}\dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}\frac{z^n}{(q;q)_n}=\frac{e(z/\sqrt{t};q)-e(z\sqrt{t};q)}{\dfrac{e(2z\sqrt{t};q)}{\sqrt{t}}-\sqrt{t}~e(2z/\sqrt{t};q)}\left(\dfrac{e(z\sqrt{t};q)}{\sqrt{t}}+\sqrt{t}~e(z/\sqrt{t};q)\right). $$ The rhs is symmetric under $t\to 1/t$, so $\dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}$ is also symmetric: $$ \dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}=t^{n/2}{B_n(1/t,q)}.\tag{1} $$ We know that $B_n(t,q)=B_{n,0}t^0+...$ starts with the power $t^0$. Due to $(1)$ this means that the highest power of $t$ in the polynomial $B_n(t,q)$ is $n$, and $B_{n,a}(q)=B_{n,n-a}(q)$ as required. $\bf{Step~2}.$ $\displaystyle{\binom{\alpha}a_q+\sum_k\binom{\alpha}k_q2^{\alpha-k}B_{k,b}(q)= \binom{\alpha}b_q +\sum_k\binom{\alpha}k_q2^{\alpha-k}B_{k,a}(q)},~ a,b,\in \mathbb{N},~a+b+1=\alpha.$ $\it{Proof}$. According to q-binomial theorem $e(z;q)=\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{z^n}{(q;q)_n}=\frac{1}{(z;q)_\infty}$. Now we equate the coefficients of $z^n$ in both sides of \begin{align} \left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(2tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}-t\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(2z)^l}{(q;q)_l}\right)\cdot\sum_{k\geq1}B_k(t,q)\frac{z^k}{(q;q)_k}={(e(z;q)-e(tz;q))(e(tz;q)+te(z;q))}\\ =\left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{z^l}{(q;q)_l}-\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}\right)\left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}+t\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{z^l}{(q;q)_l}\right) \end{align} and obtain $$ \sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_k(t,q) \left(t^{n-k}-t\right) }{2^{k-n}}-\sum _{k=1}^n \left(1-t^k\right) \left(t^{n-k}+t\right) \binom{n}{k}_q=0. $$ The coefficient of $t^{a+1}$ in the above formula is (note that for $a\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $a+1\neq1$ and for $b=n-a-1\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $a+1\neq n$, so the 'boundary' terms with $t$ and $t^n$ don't make any contribution in the formula below) $$ -\sum _{k=1}^n\binom{n}{k}_q \frac{B_{k,a}(q) }{2^{k-n}}+\sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_{k,a+1+k-n}(q)}{2^{k-n}}+\binom{n}{a}_q-\binom{n}{b}_q=0. $$ Finally, taking into account $B_{k,a+1+k-n}(q)=B_{k,k-b}(q)=B_{k,b}(q)$ we have $$ \binom{n}{b}_q+\sum _{k=1}^n\binom{n}{k}_q \frac{B_{k,a}(q) }{2^{k-n}}=\binom{n}{a}_q+\sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_{k,b}(q)}{2^{k-n}}. $$ 

I am familiar with Rayleigh Ritz Ratio for hermitian matrices. Let $A_1$ be a given $N \times N$ hermitian matrix. Then the smallest eigenvalue of $A_1$ is given by \begin{align} \lambda_{min}(A_1)=\min_{x^Hx=1}x^HA_1x \end{align} This led me to the following question. Let me define a new quantity \begin{align} \lambda_{min}(A_1,A_2)=\min_{x^Hx=1}\max(x^HA_1x,x^HA_2x) \end{align} where $A_2$ is another given hermitian matrix. Is this quantity known before?. Is any there intuitive way of looking at it? I was able to figure out that I could solve it using semi-definite optimization. Any comments on what happens when I try it for $k$ matrices $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_k$ 

$M=2$, $N\geq 2$, no conditions on $A_i$ $M=3$, $N\geq 3$, no conditions on $A_i$ $A_i$'s are tridiagonal and real in some basis. No conditions on $M$ and $N$. (from Nathaniel Johnston's answer). 

Let $T$ be a $N\times N$ transition matrix for a markov chain with $N$ states. Thus $T_{ij}$ is the probability of transition from state $i$ to state $j$ (and thus rows summing to one). Now consider the matrix $$T_k=T\otimes T$$. Its easy to see that rows of $T_k$ sum to one and each entry is non-negative. Thus, $T_k$ is a transition matrix for some markov chain which has $N^2$ states. What is the relation between markov chains corresponding to $T$ and $T_k$. I am not able to visualize this. 

The following formula gives a parametric extension of $(1)$ for $|a|$ sufficiently small \begin{align} \small\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^x+e^{-x}+e^{a+ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{-ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}=1 \end{align} This means that $(1)$ is not an isolated result. In view of this one might be very sceptical that any number theoretic interpretation of the integral exists. 

It turns out that the answer is quite easy. Take $p=q^2$,$~z=1$,$~b=q^2a$, then $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (bq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty z^n q^{n(n-1)/2}=2 \left(q a,q/a;q^2\right){}_{\infty }\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{\left(-1/a\right)^n q^{n^2+n}}{1-a q^{2 n+1}}. $$ The sum on the RHS is proportional to Appell-Lerch sum $$ m(qa^2,q^2,q^2/a) $$ in the notation of the paper E. Mortenson, D. Hickerson, Hecke-type double sums, Appell-Lerch sums, and mock theta functions (I), Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, (3) 109 (2014), no. 2, 382-422. In general Appell-Lerch sums do not have infinite product representations. For example take $a=q^{-1/2}$, then we get the sum of the type $m(1,q^2,z)$,$~z\neq 1$ which is related to mock theta function of order $2$, formula $(4.2)$ in the paper cited above. Therefore $(1)$ can not have a closed form. 

In the paper "Transformations of infinite series" Bryden Cais gives the following transformations of infinite products With some modification of Cais's method using contour integration one can obtain the following generalizations of these infinite product transformations $$ \prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{1-e^{-\pi\alpha\sqrt{n^2+\beta^2}}}{1+e^{-\pi\alpha\sqrt{n^2+\beta^2}}}\right)^{(-1)^n}=\sqrt{\frac{\tanh\frac{\pi\beta}{2}}{\tanh\frac{\pi\alpha\beta}{2}}}\prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{1-e^{-\pi\sqrt{n^2/\alpha^2+\beta^2}}}{1+e^{-\pi\sqrt{n^2/\alpha^2+\beta^2}}}\right)^{(-1)^n},\tag{1} $$ $$ \prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(1-\tfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{1+\sqrt{5}+4\cosh{\frac{2\pi\alpha\sqrt{n^2+\beta^2}}{5}}}\right)^{\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)}=\prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(1-\tfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{1+\sqrt{5}+4\cosh{\frac{2\pi\sqrt{n^2/\alpha^2+\beta^2}}{5}}}\right)^{\left(\frac{n}{5}\right)}.\tag{2} $$ It is clear that $(1)$ and $(2)$ reduce to theorem 4 and proposition 26 respectively, when $\beta=0$. Note that infinite products in theorem 4 and proposition 26 are modular forms, however the infinite products in $(1)$ and $(2)$ are not.
