As a student of mostly dead "classical" languages, most of the "linguistics" I did encounter, was and is historic linguistics aiming at a reconstruction of a postulated "proto"-language, predating the known and handed down languages, which again predate the spoken languages of today. Now, while from my perspective of a semi- to quarter-linguist it makes perfect sense, that linguistics should focus on language as opposed to literature (or: "art", as esoneill put it), already the question struck me as quite absurd (regarding my experience), since the linguistics I know does not only not focus on spoken language but even near-totally suppresses any reference to "language" as something spoken rather than written. This is, of course, because of the fact, that written evidence endures much longer than the sound of an utterance and so is the only available data for this sort of historical linguistics. Still, sometimes even here, stress is laid on the spoken languages. Of course not so much in what concerns "proto"-languages, but there are, for example, attempts to reconstruct the phonology of (Vedic) Sanskrit and it is quite well known that Classical Sanskrit never was a spoken language at all. (Incidentally, this holds true for most of the "classical" Indian languages). This kind of reverses the modern approach to languages, reflected in the answers already given: spoken language is here only appended and ancillary to the written. 

Not all words can - according to Arab grammarians - be etymologized, which means in practice: be reduced to a verbal root from which they derive. Therefore, for example, while you will find most words in Arabic dictionaries subsumed under their respective root (e.g. "muslim" not under the letter "mim", but under the root s-l-m), other words are not subordinated under a root, because they cannot. Now, as fdb pointed out, some loans, once they are perceived as Arabic, can be squeezed into that pattern. Others are "left alone", perhaps not being important enough to generate a need for related words of the same general concept. Still they may undergo the same treatment as native Arabic words. An example are the so called "retrograde singulars". From Greek yakinthos "jacinth, hyacinth" Arabic "یواقیت", "yawāqīt" was borrowed, therefrom a new singular "یاقوت", "yāqūt", was formed. 

I would say that filler words are one sort of discourse marker, but the former term is less well defined and less consistently used than the latter. The sense that I consider most central is epitomized in English by "um" or "like": a sound that indicates that the speaker is not currently emitting content, but will presently do so, and wishes to retain the floor. ("like" is usually used to fill a much shorter gap, but the usage is otherwise quite similar) Other discourse markers can impart some connotative nuance to an utterance - the difference between the connectives in "He's a programmer, [and/but] he likes poetry" don't distinguish any denotational sense, but the contrast does convey two greatly differing sets of beliefs (real or adopted for effect) about programmers and poetry. 

The question has been well answered for specifics. I'd only want to add that a little thought would have answered it in general: most of language learning happens before a learner ever goes to school, so level of schooling cannot possibly be relevant. Furthermore, for most of human history, most people have been unschooled, unlettered, and illiterate, and in many places today most speakers do not have advanced schooling. Under those conditions, how would languages with complex morphological rules have ever developed? As a final point, consider English word order, the rules for which are quite as complex as those for case in other languages. Do you find that English speakers make mistakes in word order if they lack adequate schooling? Any native speaker of English could parse a sentence like "The man that John said Mary expected to receive a watch from hit him" and know that Mary expected the watch from the man (and not from John) and that John was hit by the man (and not the other way around). This is not something you're taught in school, and neither is case (which is used to express exactly the same relationships) 

The simple answer is that the field of linguistics as it is understood today begins in the 20th century, with deep roots in prior study of language. The practice of asking questions about language and how it works is much more ancient, as is the practice of asking questions about the mind and how it works and develops, but it is not until the 20th century that we start to see a systematic approach that links those questions, which in my view is what marks linguistics as a discipline today. By way of analogy, the field of chemistry can be said to start in approximately the late eighteenth century. The practice of asking questions about the internal structure of matter or the interactions of different sorts of matter goes back much further, through alchemy and various informal knowledge systems (Roman concrete, for example) back to the Greek speculations, and so forth, but it is not until it the questions of internal structure and interactions become linked that modern chemistry begins. 

Both Persian and Turkish - as have other "islamic" languages - have a great deal of Arabic vocabulary. Due to an (initially) favourable vowel inventory (and maybe due to the same script being used) these loans have come to Persian in much of their original shape, while their Turkish counterparts do differ quite a lot. There seems to be some regularity, but I did not, up to now, figure it out completely. So the question is: how do (especially vowel) sounds change, when a word travels from Arabic to Turkish? How about the same thing for Persian words in Turkish? To understand these processes better: what was the general way of Arabic words coming to Turkish, I mean by way of which idiom or even language did Arabic words come to modern Turkey-turkish? Now what I figured out up to now is this: The short vowels a, i and u in Arabic can be realized in Turkish as a/e, i/ı and u/ü respectively. This accords with the vowel harmony and it seems, that there is some connection with a kind of "consonant harmony" which is familiar to me from Old Uyghur, to the effect that the dark vowel is chosen in circumstances of dark consonants like q, 'ayn and the retroflex l. And of course vice versa, the light vowel being used in appropriate consonant surroundings. Does anybody know more about that, since it does not seem to be the be-all and end-all? 

It may be of interest to note, that کندن shows a root-dualism. The Old Indian form of the root is khan, similar Pāzand χandan. So, the New Persian words χān/χāne, "house" derives from the same root as kent. This shows, that it is quite plausible that a word denoting a place to live should derive from the root "to dig". On the other hand it maybe explains, why you did not find any use of the word kent in Persian. 

Verbal roots of PIE are generally reconstructed as (C5) (C3) C1 e C2 (C4) (C6); with certain phonetical restrictions, especially on the outmost consonants. I wonder why only "e" should be allowed as a root vowel and why it is generally attempted to "explain away" cases of other root vowels (like "a"), as stated in Tichy's "Indogermanistisches Grundwissen" (p. 35; my approximate translation): 

I saw the statement a few times that sign languages inflect in the same way that spoken languages do, but all examples I came across refer to phenomena that I would classify as word formation rather than actual inflection. (Edit.) So my question is this: does any sign language possess a unit (hand or finger movement, facial expression, anything really) that: 

A complement to the answers above: The alphabet used for transcribing and the level of transcription are frequently confused. IPA can, just as any other alphabet, be used for both phonetic and phonemic transcription (the difference has already been neatly explained), or anything in between. One might argue IPA is richer, poorer, more or less readable, flexible, regular, whatever, but in principle there is nothing in it, or any other alphabet, that forces you to use it at any particular level of abstraction. Alphabet and level of abstraction are two independent variables. 

What different definitions of phoneme do you know? Please note that I'm not asking for an explanation of what phoneme is but rather for professional definitions. I'm interested in how the issue is tackled in different phonological theories. Edit: It sure is very interesting (no irony) to see how different authors explain why they're not going to refer to phoneme in their work. However, if you come across a definition (of the kind of definitions of terms that they have in mathematics), I will be still grateful if you cared to add it or refer to it here. 

I've never heard of any specific movement that would obligatorily accompany a specific word or phrase. However, especially if you count facial expression as movement, certain rhetoric strategies are, I believe, accompanied at least very often by movement. Sarcasm, mockery and such typically involve a specific intonation and facial expression. In that sense I can see how a certain phrase could begin to usually cooccur with a specific expression through being used primarily in an ironic sense. I suppose that this also accounts to a certain degree for the popularity of emoticons: without them it's often diffucult to decide if what one's reading is a joke or serious. I suppose yes and no might often come together with head movement but it's surely not a rule. On a theoretical ground, I can say this would be a relatively unlikely thing to happen, as being obviously redundant. The only scenario that comes to my mind that could lead to an obligatory cooccurrence, is with 'holy' or taboo words, where e.g. a certain movement could perhaps possibly be required in some culture when mentioning the name of a god, demon or something of the kind.
