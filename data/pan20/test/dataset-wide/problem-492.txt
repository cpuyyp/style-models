Yes Of course it's possible, you just need to find a telescopic seat post on the market that is longer than the one you have. Your measurement of your post might be a bit off though, I'm guessing that from your 28.x measurement, and the fact that I don't think 34.2mm is a seatpost size... not one that I'm familiar with anyways. In which case chances are your post is a 34.9mm, not a 34.2mm, and that something like this will do the trick: 34.9mm EXTRA LONG EXTENDABLE SEAT POST 530mm-730mm(21"-28") TELESCOPIC ALLOY 

Yes, there are no complications with running a 9 speed crankset on an 8 speed drivetrain. You can see image below that some 9 speed cranks are even listed as being 9/8 speed cranks. You shouldn't encounter any problems, but you will have you readjust your front d√©railleur to make room for the larger ring, and double check your chain length on big rings after it's installed. 

I have two threaded holes on the inside of my frame on my 2007 Stumpjumper FSR and I don't know what they are for. 

If you're really that concerned, get a roll of 3M "copter tape" and cut it to the same size as the cleat. Given the cleat should never move, the most you should get is a bit of marking where the cleat sits which you'll never see as the cleat should never move (and it's helpful when you're replacing cleats) 

All the clamp needs to do is hold the bike securely. If it holds securely and doesn't wobble it will be fine. I use an Elite trainer and have never used the skewer that came with it as I haven't had a problem with the one I have on my trainer wheel. 

I think you answered your own question. The huge gap will mean you need to use a long chain for the big ring and you may not have enough movement in the rear mech to tighten it if you're in the small ring. My guess would be you'll suck the chain into the rear wheel in some combination of gears and, at best, snap your hanger, at worse damage your frame. Why not use a mid-compact (52-36) and a large cassette (11-32) 

I sold Specialized bikes for a lot of years, they do make gender specific frames, women's bikes have shorter top tubes relative to the seat tubes, this is because women on average have shorter backs and longer legs than men do, they also come with womens saddles, and sometimes women specific grips (for feminine hands). The Sectour is considered a men's frame. Not everyone is built the same though, my wife rides a men's frame because she is really tall in the body. The only other difference between men and women's Specialized frames is that women's frames sometimes have "girlier" colours and paint details. 

If bleeding your brakes or swapping out brake parts is a bit beyond you, then you need to take your bike to your local shop, they'll be able to tell you exactly what's going on, and may recommend you upgrade your brakes or your rotors. The alternative is to slow it down and ride gentler grades. 

Chances are it's not too long, it just appears that way because it's deflated. You just need to put some air in it, put one or two pumps in the tube, just enough to mostly inflate it, but not enough to stretch the rubber (over-inflating it will also make it look too long), then set the tube in your tire, it should be fine. You may need to let the air back out after in order to set the bead. 

I personally think that the wear issue is not as simple as one size chain being better than the other. Whilst this may be the case, it will all depend on the quality of the products involved ie cog, chainring and chain. 

I don't have an electric bike either. I do a commute of just under this distance each way every day and when used to it this distance is no issue. The problem I see with electric bikes is when resorting to pedalling only whether through desire or necessity you are "carrying" a hell of a lot of extra weight on top of the weight of the bike. I totally agree with the suggestions made by Kibbee. 

I agree with Snikrs and also ride a steel fixed gear frame in often wet UK. I recently purchased my current frame (upgrade the old one didn't rust through) and before using it sprayed the inside of the frame with Waxoyl but if I had been able to find it in the UK would probably have used J.P. Weigle's Frame Saver which many people swear by. What I don't like about Waxoyl is it remains quite slimy, I'm not sure if it would be good in a hot climate but it would be better than nothing. You have to be careful in the seat post area and clean it out to allow the frame to grip the seat post. But if done with care its not an issue. I usually just wipe the seat post with an old greasy rag to prevent it sticking in the frame. It is also important to move the seat post every now and again (3 months maybe) as a stuck seat post can be really hard to remove. The other precautions I took before riding the frame were: 

If you're never walking on the cleats and can track-stand at junctions and traffic lights they should almost never wear out. There is minimal wear clipping in and out. The reds are 9 degrees of float before unclipping which may increase the wear though. I use the black cleats (0 degrees) and I wear out the bottom of the cleats through walking and stopping/starting long before I wear them out from riding. In fact, I'm on only on my second pair in 4 years. 

One option you're not considering is that the freehub body on your wheelset maybe be upgradable. Given you don't say what wheels they are but I assume given they're almost certainly disc hubs to use cx1 you may find this is an option. If you update saying what wheels you have on the rear and what hub it is then it's a good start 

Three things to check: 1, Is the bead seated correctly. It's pretty common to get tyres blowing off the rim if they're not seated correctly. That said, this usually leads to an exploding tube rather than the tyre just coming off 2, As Daniel R Hicks said, are the rims so worn they're expanding? 3, Check the rim for dings and warping as Malarky sort of says, but not just the area for the bead. You may have a bent rim Chances are, though, that the tyres are done. The pictures would make me think they're on their last legs. I had a pair of 20+ year old ones recently that ended up in the bin as they just weren't reliable enough for me. Some things aren't worth saving a few euros/pounds/dollars over, and the contact points on a bike are some of those things for me. If the rims seem fine new tyres are where I'd go. 

Bearings are never as buttery once they've been installed, they all feel rougher after they're put under pressure. I put GXP BB90's in my carbon 29er frame and it was the same, though not too bad. It looks like you've installed them properly, it may just be that the frame could be a bit on the tighter side. Riding the bike will loosen things up a bit though, take it for a ride then check the bearings again to see if there's any difference. Unfortunately there's really nothing else you can do about it except hope that it smooths out a little from breaking it in. Those bearings are a closed system, you can't adjust them. The only other solution is to try a different bottom bracket. 

I'm always worried about pinching my tubes when installing them, I've done it loads of times, especially when installing really tight tires. You can pinch a tube just enough to get a slow leak, so you're right to wonder if that's a probable cause. It could also be the valve as @Blam suggests, especially if it's a schrader valve tube (same valve type as car tires). Another likely culprit is the rim of the wheel itself. Does the rim have a proper rim tape/rim strip on it? If your rims aren't properly taped, then when you pump your tires up to pressure you can actually puncture the tube on the spokes, or cut the tube on the spoke holes, depending on how many walls your rim has. Check to make sure your tube is protected from the rim. Rim Strip $URL$ Simple Ruber Rim tape/strip 

I have a new steel frame which I am building up. I intend to rust proof this first by using Waxoyl made by Hammerite which I will use on the inside of the frame and forks. Should I use this on the outside of the steerer column ie under the stem etc? I am worried about the stem slipping with this substance being oil based. If not is there any way that I can rust proof the outside of the steerer column? Thanks in advance. 

I have a set of Avid Shorty 4 cantilever brakes, well two sets (front and back) and wish to upgrade the pads. These are centre pull, linear pull brakes and have brake pads which are mounted from the centre, ie the post (which is threaded) is centred in the pad. Looking for new pads I see that there is a much wider variety of v-brake pads than cantilever pads. As v-brakes are a subset of cantilever brakes can I use v-brake blocks with my cantilever brakes? I note these tend to have more brake pad at the back of the mounting post than at the front of the pad. I would also like if possible cartridge mounted pads any recommendations would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

It's a Mongoose Detain frameset. Originally retailed for around 200 dollars at Walmart as a complete bike. Comparing the op's frame to the one above it's clear they're not the same if only because the backwards circle has a double seatstay sort of thing. Anyway, the frame matches a google image search so I'm 99% sure I'm right 

The BCD shouldn't make any difference to how the cranks work, just which chainrings you use. As long as the BB matches the cranks go ahead. 

It's about keeping your energy up NOT about somehow generating 5kmph more from food. You'll go faster through training but it won't help if you bonk half way through a ride. I tend to "fuel" up before a ride then eat as I go along; usually rice cakes or cereal bars. For a bit of emergency energy if I'm flagging I'll go with a gel (some give me cramps tho) or something like shot bloks. However I can say with confidence that if I'd eaten properly as I rode, I'd never have needed them. As an aside, if your AVERAGE speed on a solo ride is 35-45kmph, I'd start racing pretty; that is pretty quick. 

The one step I didn't follow in the Bike Radar article was drilling a hole in the bottom bracket shell. I couldn't bring myself to put a hole in my nice new frame even though its not a flash one. I suspect plugging all holes before ever ridding may negate the need for this but I will inspect the bottom bracket shell after a few very wet rides. If you do drill a hole remember this will open the frame up to rust so paint it or varnish it. Finally keep on to of scratches. I usually apply clear nail varnish as you can never get a perfect colour matched paint. I hope this helps. 

Stuck a large rubber bung in the base of the steerer column to prevent water entering here (even though I have mudguards). I had to shorten the bung slightly to prevent it showing. My saddle clamp encloses the top of the seat post if this wasn't the case I would fill this in a similar manner. This is something I have done on all my frames for the last 20 or more years. Filled every bolt hole with a bolt ensuring ample waterproof grease was applied to the threads. Teflon grease is not great at this I find it gets washed out easily. Marine grease is much better, I use Unipart Marine but there are loads available; they are all considerably cheaper than any proprietary bike grease and I use mine for most applications (hubs, headsets etc) and it last much longer between applications (I commute every day in all weathers). Filled all drain holes as described in step 3 of the Bike Radar winter proofing article. For my frame match sticks were way too small. I used chopsticks, I found snipping approx 3-5 mm off the end and then cutting 5 mm of chopstick was a perfect fit and pretty flush to the frame. Before pushing into the hole I coated in the wood in clear nail varnish (not mine) and then again over the top and overlapping slightly onto the frame once inserted. This varnish prevents water absorption and helps create a seal without using glue. Finally before fitting the bottom bracket I coated the threads of the shell and its interior with the waterproof grease even though already sprayed with Waxoyl.
