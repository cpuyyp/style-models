Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a fairly common complaint from cyclists. You really should consult with a medically-trained therapist, but straight leg lifts, oddly, are a good place to start. (Lay on back, hold leg straight, lift without bending knee.) 

For subtle chain rub problems sometimes adjusting the angle (very slightly!) is the best approach. But remember that if the rub is only once a revolution it suggests that the ring, arm, or crank is bent. 

Depends on how extreme the wobble is. It takes very little lack of trueness to cause rim brakes to drag, but in a pinch you can usually disconnect the cable or some such and still manage (assuming the brakes on the other wheel are OK). After that, the wobble of wheel is distracting and will make the bike unpleasant and tiring to ride at high speed. Also, of course, it impacts the stability of the bike, making falls more likely. If the wobble gets worse, the wheel can begin to rub against the fork or stays, and it gets unrideable. One does need to be wary if, say, a single spoke is broken, causing wobble. This situation puts additional stress on other spokes, making a second failure more likely, and a second failed spoke in the wrong place could cause the wheel to become suddenly quite "loopy", resulting in a crash. 

The sprocket size. Pretty much all coaster brake chains are the same width/pitch, but the number of teeth on the cog can differ. The axle diameter. I think this is pretty standard, but likely there's a slight difference between English and metric dimensioned axles. The axle width, measured between the outside edge of the nuts that fit inside the frame. Doesn't need to be exact, but within 1/4" or so. Again, this should be fairly standard. The rim diameter/width. As the other answers note, there's a significant difference between a 2-1/4" rim and a 2.125" rim -- two different systems for sizing rims, and it affects rim diameter more than rim width. 

First off, if anyone has mucked with the components on the bike it's possible that they exchanged either the brake levers or the brakes themselves and produced a mismatch where the levers are not capable of providing enough pressure. But this shouldn't be a problem if the bike has all it's original components. And if, when you squeeze the brake levers, they "bottom out" against the bar, that indicates that they're misadjusted or the cables are rusted/worn. (If, due to wheel wobble, you can't adjust tight enough to prevent bottoming out then you need to get the wheel trued.) But failing those, likely it's a problem with the brake pads. First make sure they are squarely pressing against the side of the rim and have not gotten twisted to where they're making poor contact. And check to see that the pads are not worn down to where the metal pad holder is close to hitting the rim. (Note that the rear edge of the brake pad will tend to wear faster than the front -- simply because the pad looks good from the front does not mean it is good.) If the pads are not worn out (and they don't have oil on them or some other such problem) then it's probably just a problem with pads that are too hard and you need new pads that are a little "grabbier". This is, to a degree, a personal choice thing, as there are different pad materials with different characteristics (and most people don't like pads that grab too much), but it's also true that a given set of pads will get harder and brake more poorly as they get older and more worn. One last possibility is that you have the rare case of steel rims (usually only seen on very cheap bikes). Brakes don't work nearly as well on steel rims as on aluminum, and so for steel you need pads that are quite "grabby". 

Back when I used to do a lot of winter cycling (southern MN) I'd generally wear glove liners, then either a loose fingered "driving glove" or a ski mitt. In general, I'd say no matter what you do have at least two layers, and have the outer layer (which should be wind-proof) easily removed. On a bike you often need good finger dexterity to fiddle with something, and you can't do that with heavy gloves on. But remove all gloves and your hands go numb quickly. The glove liners I use are polypropylene (most recently from Performance brand, since I can no longer find the better brand I used to buy), knit as one piece, a little heavier than T-shirt fabric. (There are heavier sewn glove liners, but they're generally too thick to wear under regular gloves.) In fact, I have about ten pair, and I still use them sometimes on cool rides (under regular fingerless gloves), plus I keep a pair in every jacket -- handy even off the bike. 

Roughly speaking, the brake pads for rim brakes should be positioned at about the bead seat (so as to fall on the flat of the rim), so for a 700c they would be roughly 311mm from the center of the axle dropout slot 

Yeah, the only real problem is maintaining fine enough control of the motion, both in actively moving the lever, and in avoiding "creep" between shifts. In part it comes down to how much fine muscle control you have, and in part it has to do with the quality of the shifter and how it's mounted. 

What do you expect to happen? Not quite sure what you mean by "roadster", but I assume it's roughly the same as a "road bike" in the US -- what would have been called a "racing bike" 30 years ago before racing bikes got all high-tech. The main distinguishing characteristics of such bikes are that they have a more "aggressive" riding position, a lighter-weight frame, and skinny tires. They'll also usually have "drop" handlebars, but that's true of many bikes in other categories. All of those characteristics make it harder to ride on rough, uneven pavement, and the skinny tires can make it impossible to ride on really loose gravel. But it's certainly possible to ride on ordinary "broken pavement", if you exercise a little care. As to the bike, such conditions would tend to be rough on a carbon frame or exotic rims, but a bike of more ordinary construction (if you can find one anymore) should not experience extraordinary wear/fatigue. You'd want a bike, first and foremost, with sturdy rims -- 32 spoke if possible, and at least 28. And you should probably stay away from super-narrow tires. 

In my opinion this thread is a lot of elitist carp. There are plenty of perfectly competent bike commuters and tourists, eg, who can't do a track stand or a bunny hop, and many road bikes do not have the steering geometry for "no hands" riding. It's nice if you can do all this stuff, but to imply that a cyclist is incompetent (and should by implication stay off the road) if they can't is pompous and arrogant. 

Where possible, replace with stainless fasteners. Things like water bottle bracket bolts are readily available in stainless at a good hardware store. But most fasteners on a good quality bike are stainless to begin with, so it may be that you're not seeing "rust" per se but rather a sort of corrosion that can form on stainless. 

Understand that an LED circuit consists of a voltage/current source (dyno or battery), a current limiter (resistor or something more exotic), and the LED itself. "LED" means "light emitting diode", and a "diode" is a one-way switch -- a "rectifier" that, in other situations, can be used to convert AC to DC. So current only flows through an LED in one direction. An LED has a "voltage drop" in the "forward" (conducting) direction of about about two volts. This means that no matter how much voltage you attempt to apply (up to the point that the LED catches fire), the voltage across the LED terminals will be about 2 volts, with the remaining voltage being "dropped" by resistance elsewhere in the circuit. So typically, for, say, a 6 volt supply, a series resistor will be added to the circuit to such that the voltage drop across the resistor would be 4 volts at the target current (where V(voltage) = I(current) * R(resistance)). This is a simplistic "constant current" power supply. Since a dynamo does not produce a constant voltage (it inherently varies with speed), a simple resistance-based constant-current supply is not optimal. So circuitry is likely to include a transistor or two or three to regulate the current in a different fashion. Another approach, where AC power is available (as it is with a dynamo) is to "switch" the power so that current only gets through for part of the AC "cycle". (This is the scheme used by household light dimmers.) So the issue here is not so much the LED itself, but the associated current-limiting circuitry. A simple transistor-based current limiter will probably work fine. A "switching" scheme will likely fail to work properly when fed DC, and there is some chance of circuit damage. 

With auto brakes it's because of the thin layer of corrosion that's built up on the rotors. No experience with bike disks. 

I would skip using the truing stand and just true the wheel on the trailer. You can generally clamp a strip of something to the frame to act as an indicator (have it stick out and just brush the rim, kind of like a rim brake pad), so you can more easily zero in on the worst spots. Dishing/centering is harder without a stand, but there should no need to dish/center a trailer wheel that accurately in most cases. 

The increased weight of the larger wheel (if indeed it does increase) will of course add weight to the bike, but additional weight adds very little rolling resistance (though it does of course affect hill climbing). It is a myth that "rotating mass slows you down". In terms of top speed there's no difference between weight on the wheel rim and weight anywhere else on the bike. Added weight on the wheel rim does reduce acceleration, but 10 grams on the wheel rim only has the acceleration-limiting effect of 20 grams elsewhere -- it's not really enough to notice. (And once you've accelerated to speed this effect goes away.) A larger wheel can ride over slight irregularities in the road with less energy expenditure, and so can be more efficient (and less tiring) in some circumstances. And a larger wheel generally is more stable (though at the expense of maneuverability). 

When installing an inner tube, one must take extra care with regard to the area near the valve stem. It is fairly easy to get a portion of the thickened area around the stem "trapped" behind the tire bead, leading to a situation where the bead does not seat completely and resulting in a lump. There are several strategies to deal with this. First, make sure the tube is partly inflated (almost fully "puffed out") when you insert it into the tire and mount the tire. Then, after the tire is (mostly) seated on the rim, let any excess pressure out of the tube and then press the stem in with your finger, about as far as you can get it to go. This helps pull the rubber around the valve out from behind the tire bead. Then, when you think you have it all together, carefully inspect the bead all the way around to make sure it's evenly seated to the rim everywhere. Correct as needed. I will note that if a tube is too large or too small you may get lumps, but your tube appears to be properly sized. 

Ultimately you want a bike that you will enjoy riding. An over-heavy bike is clumsy to ride, and a super-racer bike is uncomfortable for most people, so somewhere in-between is usually the best choice. I'd actually encourage starting with a relatively inexpensive (perhaps used or maybe borrowed) bike, until you get a "feel" for riding and decide if you're a "racer" or a "loafer", and decide if your body is more comfortable upright or in a racing crouch. 

This Park Tool web page shows the basic procedure. You need the BB cup tool for that particular model of cartridge. 

I think most of the current gel seats are worthless -- like too many bikes these days, built to sell, not to ride on. There used to be the old TushCush/HydroSeat sold by Nat Calvert that was pretty good (it was a bladder and leather cover for a standard seat), but he sold the business to someone else who ran it into the ground. 

It's not unusual for an asymmetric shaft (on some rear wheels or solid-crank bottom brackets, eg) to have different numbers of balls in one side vs the other. But it's a little unusual for a standard front hub. And if there's intentionally a difference then there would be a small but visible difference in the size of the races as well. Likely the hub was serviced in the past and one ball was lost (or you lost one somehow). But it's not really terribly serious. It's often recommended (as a general rule for ball bearings) to have "a full race minus one" vs having the race completely full, and your typical 10-ball bearing can survive reasonably missing 2-3 balls (though that's not ideal). However, since you have things apart it would be worthwhile to replace the balls. (Don't mix old and new balls.) See if ten fit comfortably. If they fit, and there's still room for a fingernail between them, then use ten, otherwise go with nine. 

How bad is it? If it's only a couple of mm then just manually spread the fork slightly as you install the wheel. (Also make sure that no unnecessary washers have been added to the axle.) 

Just for future reference, I'll add this: My son purchased a "Eurobike" of sorts a couple of months back and brought it on the week-long group bike tour we took last week. The bike is branded by a purportedly good outfit in California, and built (of course) in China. It is a 26-inch unsuspended hybrid, with a variable-speed NuVinci rear hub and a Shimano generator front hub. In general it appears to be a good quality bike. Before the ride started it was discovered that one spoke was broken on the rear wheel (and a repair was effected), and during the last day of the ride a second spoke broke. Both spokes broke at the nipple. On examination of the wheel it could be seen that the large-diameter hub and the 2-cross pattern caused the spokes to approach the rim at an angle substantially off from 90 degrees, causing quite obvious bending of the spoke where it enters the nipple. The tendency to break at this point was likely further abetted by undersized, poor quality spokes. I am guessing that the wheel will need to be relaced, though we will see what the bike shop and manufacturer say after my son gets back to California. It's vaguely possible that the rim was drilled for the off-angle nipples but the wheel was built wrong, with the odd nipples in the even holes or some such. In any event, heavier gauge, better quality spokes are needed. (Other than the spoke problem -- and an associated problem with the enclosed chain while servicing -- the bike performed admirably, handling some very substantial hills.) 

There's no great way. The main problem is that inhaled cold air causes an automatic reaction in the nasal passages to create more mucous. And to a degree simply having cold air blowing against the face around the sinuses creates the problem. Some people will experience this worse than others. You can try using some sort of scarf or maybe a surgical mask over your nose to sort of warm the air going in. The problem with this, of course, is that if your nose is running you can't wipe it without removing the scarf/mask. Or you can use various drugs (OTC decongestants and nasal sprays) to try to control it.
