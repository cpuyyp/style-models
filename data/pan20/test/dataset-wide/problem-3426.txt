The Wikipedia page on risk aversion states that a "Constant Relative Risk Aversion implies a Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion, but the reverse is not always true". Let me decompose this statement in two parts: 1/ "Constant Relative Risk Aversion implies a Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion." A simple example is the log utility function, $u(c) = \ln(c)$, with $c>0$ satisfies the DARA because the utility function is positively skewed $\left(u'''=\frac{2}{c^3} >0\right)$ and implies a Relative Risk Aversion equals to $1 \left(=-c\frac {u''(c)}{u'(c)}\right)$. 2/ "but the reverse is not always true". I am wondering if this is the most frequent case? Or if most of the time DARA utility functions also exhibit CRRA? I would be grateful if you can illustrate your answer with some utility functions. 

These four components help Naughton providing an index of government control of resources, which tripled as a share of GDP between 1996 and 2013. This index gives an indication of the overall size of the Chinese government. For instance, all land in China is publicly owned: urban land is owned by the state, and housing is "privately owned" only in the sense that households hold long-term leases, typically of 50â€“70 years. The financial system in particular is overwhelmingly dominated by the state-owned banks, which generate substantial profits. Summing all four components, the Chinese government had direct or indirect control of 38% of GDP in 2015. Overall, the Chinese government is large, well-resourced, and potentially highly intrusive. This is both a distinctive feature of the Chinese economy in comparative context, and a dramatic change from the China of 20 years ago. 

Is there an economic theory of quitting an activity? A theory that weighs the investment costs put into something and the opportunity costs of pursuing it. I am aware of Fershtman and Gneezy Quitting in Tournaments paper that investigates the decision of quitting in the middle of a race or of a tournament. But, I am looking for a more general model of quitting something such as playing an instrument, a sport or even a job. Dropping-out from (grad)-school may obey the same investment-opportunity cost trade-off. Update: I am looking for some explicit references modeling the exiting or quitting process, even if it concerns some decisions in particular without any generalization. Edit: Here is why I picked @Ubiquitous' answer. 

Or should one wait or look for a chance to present it in a seminar? This is probably your best chance to get feedback given that profs are very busy. A bunch of universities and associations organize PhD seminars, workshops, conferences or poster sessions. Look at inomics. You may also contact profs with the intention to present your work in their seminars. 

Nash Equilibrium (N.E) is a general solution concept in Game Theory. N.E is a state of game when any player does not want to deviate from the strategy she is playing because she cannot do so profitably. So, no players wants to deviate from the strategy that they are playing given that others don't change their strategy. Thus, it is a mutually enforcing kind of strategy profile. 'Pareto optimality' is an efficiency concept. So no state will be Pareto Optimal if, at least one of the players can get more payoff without decreasing the payoff of any other player. There are many many examples of Nash Equilibria which are not pareto optimal. The most famous example could be the N.E in prisoner's dilemma. 

You need to connect it to the injections, withdrawals and to the output gap in the Keynesian Cross model. As savings increase, planned withdrawals increase in the economy. Consumption decreases, unexpected inventory pile up takes place. Hence firms reduce production and total output is reduced. As output falls unemployment will be more and hence the central bank is going to reduce the interest rate to improve the situation and boost consumption and production. 

Money supply accounts for all the 'money' in circulation in the economy and the money itself has many forms. However, in a nutshell we can understand it as the flow of all kinds of monetary assets in the economy (broad sense of money). The correlation of money supply with growth has been quite contentious. We just lost a very good central bank governor in India because of these differences in opinion. The direction of causality is not so clear. However, many of the researches have had some empirical conclusions that suggest that GDP granger causes money supply and the vice versa is not true. In short term though, it appears that an increase in money supply leads to higher economic activity (can be easily checked through standard IS-LM or AD-AS models). The long term effects are not so clear. Having said that the answer to the question is yes, there can be growth even with a reducing or stable money supply. Such a situation would lead to deflationary pressures and possible increase in the velocity of money (faster transactions) in the economy. I don't have any concrete example of this case when money supply is steadily shrinking and economic activity is still healthy and growing. This could be because money supply is usually affected heavily by central bank's tools. And central banks usually would not do this. But there are examples when money supply has remained more or less stable. Such as, U.K in 2013-14 and India in 2015-16(June). In fact in India, money supply slightly decreased during this period while economy overall was in a healthy state. 

In response to large policy interventions or shocks, imperfect substitution between factors and diminishing returns imply that factor productivities and prices will change. The same policy interventions or shocks can lead to endogenous technology responses. There may be composition effects resulting from equilibrium substitution of some factors or products for others. 

Yes, such imbalances or asymmetries are possible in practice and quite frequent across RTAs. These statistics simply mean that each ASEAN member exports more on average to the other members than they import from them. But this pattern is not true for all ASEAN countries. 

The above figure shows the VIX index of 30-day implied volatility on the Standard & Poor's 500 stock market index. The VIX index is traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. It is constructed based on the values of a range of call and put options on the Standard & Poor's 500 index and represents the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 day. Other common measures of uncertainty include forecaster disagreement, mentions of "uncertainty" in news, and the dispersion of productivity shocks to firms.

Studies in international trade are already using trade data at a particularly disaggregated level, at the transaction level. For instance, this very new paper on Global Firms points out that research in international trade has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, as attention has shifted from countries and industries towards the firms actually engaged in international trade. They outline a framework that allows firms to be of positive measure and to decide simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to export, and inputs to import. They use this framework to interpret features of U.S. firm and trade transactions data and highlight interdependencies across these margins of firm international participation. However, their data is from the U.S. Customs Bureau data and quite confidential. Can you give the source of "ton of open data available on on how much of a particular good is imported/exported"? 

The Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-PM, PLS-SEM) method to structural equation modeling allows estimating complex cause-effect relationship models with latent variables. This method seems quite popular in accounting, marketing, and management. Do you know any good application in economics? Is this method reliable to get causal estimates? 

A good site, with high quality online lectures, is the MIT Open Course Ware. You will find courses going from Principles of Macroeconomics, Economic Growth, Macroeconomic Theory I, II, III to Advanced Macroeconomics I or II.
