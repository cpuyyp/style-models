So I'd say that the answer to your question is "No", there's very little besides its orbit and light curve and approximate color that has been or probably could have been detected. With more warning, and serious interest, it's possible an observation campaign could have been organized to get more aperture area and time to make a better spectrum, but since S/N only scales as the square root of those, a lot of other observations would have had to have been rescheduled to make it happen. 

This is quite a sizable paper about quite a sizable simulation, and I'm having difficulty even getting started to read it. Question I wanted to know, for a Milky Way-like galaxy, was most of the influx from other galaxies early on, or is this something that is predicted to happen somewhat steadily throughout the galaxy's lifetime? Galaxy m12i in the simulation represents a Milky Way-mass galaxy, and so I show a screen shot of one of the figures for that galaxy below. Already I am stuck because I don't understand what $z$ represents. It seems to be related to time, rather than red-shift and $z=0$ has a special meaning, but I don't know if that's the present, or the beginning of the simulation. 

In the video linked in the Space.com article What Would It Mean for Astronomers If the WFIRST Space Telescope Is Killed?, (available in YouTube as WFIRST: The Best of Both Worlds) after Caltech cosmologist Yun Wang says: 

There are thousands of satellites and spent rocket parts in low earth orbit (LEO). Mostly near the lines of dawn and dusk they can be in sunlight while observatories below are still viewing the night sky, as are the observatories like Hubble (also in LEO). They are moving roughly 7 km/sec and as seen from Earth that motion will be roughly a half-degree per second, depending on distance. Considering the number of observatories imaging the sky at any moment and the number of objects in LEO, streaks across images must be happening quite regularly. While that would strongly impact a one-hour exposure on emulsion, these days solid state imaging is used and these are probably regularly buffered to provide the dynamic range necessary to capture dim objects with very bright images in the same field. While a fraction of a second streak by a satellite will not normally completely obliterate a long exposure, it is still a problem and it seems would have to be managed in an accepted and systematic way. Question: How do observational astronomers manage streaks and other artifacts from objects in LEO? Since these things are (usually) carefully tracked and their trajectories predictable, do observatories, or at least observers, ever plan ahead for these events, or schedule to avoid them? Or is it just handled automatically in post-processing? 

There seems to be three things described in the recent Nature Astronomy paper Millimetre-wave emission from an intermediate-mass black hole candidate in the Milky Way: 

A supplemental answer to probably someone's answer: Why this can indeed be called interferometry: Once one thinks in terms of physical optics (e.g. $\text{exp}(j(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} ))$ ) instead of ray optics, imaging is always an interference problem, and the math behind correlating signals from an array of radio telescopes to produce an image is not so much different than the math behind calculating an intensity pattern at the focal plane of an optical telescope. From the Aperture Mask Interferometry section on page 5 of the JWST Pocket Guide (see below) you can see that they have no problem using terms like "interferometry" and "non-redundant baselines" as one would when laying out a sparse pattern of dish antennas in an array. See for example a Google Maps image of the Meerkat Array Core below, which has already produced images with only 16 sites occupied with active dishes. While the mask shown in the question is a pupil mask, the pupil plane is conjugate to the telescope's aperture. So it's very similar to having seven large hexagonal holes in front of the JWST, or just using seven of the telescopes primary mirror's hexagonal mirror elements (with additional masking, these hexagons to not cover the full size of the individual elements, as shown in the illustration). An important distinction though is that these seven small apertures are of the same order in size as their separation, while in a large radio telescope array, the spacing between receivers is usually somewhere between much larger and much much larger than the aperture of individual elements. So the analogy breaks down at this point. What Aperture Masking Interferometry is for: The purpose of using the mask is to enhance the system's resolution by narrowing the central peak of the point spread function compared to what you would get from the full aperture. By loosing contrast in the full field due to diffraction artifacts, as well as loosing ~90% of the transmitted intensity, you can enhance contrast near the center of the field by narrowing the central diffractive peak, in this case in the range of 70 to 400 milli-arc seconds, according to the JAM Team's (JWST Aperture Masking Team) slides linked below. From the first link: 

This comment (below the question Is there any new water formed on, or brought to, Earth?) links to the 2002 Article in the New Scientist Was all the Earth’s water brought here by comets? which states: 

@JamesK's excellent answer is probably what you are looking for. However, to address the question of how small a location is possible, the answer is highly dependent on how you define "zenith" or "up" in general. I think you have three main choices: 

There is a short Wikipedia article Focal Plane Arrays that enumerates some projects, but my question is more along the lines of what is (at least) nearly complete or in "first light" phase, even if not commissioned yet. I'd like to differentiate between focal plane arrays (an array of multiple feeds and amplifiers) used in single dish telescopes, and those integrated into multiple dish arrays, because I'm particularly curious about single dishes being used for spatial information, or even true imaging. Ideally, the answer will give some information for each case. In the case of single dish instruments, are the elements - roughly speaking - used as pixels? Despite the longer wavelength, it's still optics and it is a telescope. If there are N individual, uncoupled feeds, does one build up an image roughly N times faster? Is the relative phase between the feeds ever used (for single dish instruments)? 

I just read in the EarthSky.org article Hours after discovery, asteroid swept by that the near earth asteroid 2016 QA2 recently passed the earth at about 85,000 km. The article says that it is a member of the Aten group of asteroids. That article links to this very cool GIF $URL$ however it's 40MB so it takes a while to load. Wikipedia says: 

The CBC News Technology and Science Q&A This ESPRESSO machine doesn't make coffee but scans the skies for habitable planets includes a nice description of ESPRESSO (Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations) and links to the YouTube video Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations. There's something really amazing (to me at least) about the way that the spectrogram has been folded so nicely on to this image. Is this what it looks like on a 2D detector? (sans colour of course) I see what looks like eight distinct sections, and a really nice spacing between adjacent lines otherwise.

Here are the Table settings. I believe that the ICRF/J2000.0 with Ecliptic and Mean Equinox settings will give you something close to GCRS but right now I am not sure how close. I'll keep reading and ask for help in comments. 

After seeing today's Washington Post's article NASA just saw Europa’s geysers erupting into space. Again., and especially the phrase "geysers erupting into space" I checked and Europa has a surface gravity of about 1.3 $m/s^2$, which is substantial - almost the same as the Moon's at about 1.6 $m/s^2$! The BBC's website article Europa moon 'spewing water jets' says 

The Phys.org article 'Mystery' signal from space is solved. It's not aliens cites a summary of the conclusion "by Abel Mendez, director of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo in a blog post Friday, revealing the true nature of the signals."

Well the Roadster is quite far away now and moving farther rapidly. See this answer for some details and some nice images from medium-sized tracking telescopes. It's already dimmer than +22 magnitude as seen from Earth, and as far as I know there won't be any really close approaches to Earth for a long time. 

Without going too deep in to GR, how might that happen? Question: What kinds of WFIRST observations and interpretations would be used to potentially address the nature of dark energy? Based on comments, I'll reclassify the following as an afterthought: Is this in any way related to news about a recent observational non-exclusion of Erik Verlinde's theories (the guy who's "Trying to kill dark matter"), discussed in Margot Brouwer's 2016 video Verlindes new theory first tested with weak gravitational lensing about the VLT Survey Telescope kilo-degree survey results (see also Cosmos Magazine's New theory of ‘dark gravity’ passes first test, but Einstein’s still on top, or am I mixing apples and oranges? 

The article also links to this University of Iowa page smallcomets.physics.uiowa.edu/. Is this still believed to be happening? Have there been additional observations? Is the earth receiving water in the form of 20 to 40 ton comets ariving every three seconds? Question: What ever happened to the "Small Comet Theory" of water influx on present-day Earth? Has it been discounted, modified, verified? 

There is a picture of the moon in National Public Radio's on-line article Get Ready For Halloween By Watching The Moon's 'Occultation' Tonight. It looks wrong to me - specifically, the brightness gradation near the terminator - or lack thereof. The image is credited "A waning gibbous moon occultation will be visible Tuesday night in parts of the United States. JPL/NASA" but I wonder if this is true. Something just looks "wrong" here. 

Since galactic coordinates are centered near the Sun, the distance of our position from the origin will still be about 1 AU (150,000,000 km). Below I wrote a little script in Python using the easy-to-use Skyfield python package. At the moment that I've run the program , the coordinates are: 

above: for those who can not distinguish the green and blue in the image, this plots the average green (solid) and blue (dashed) intensity within the central equatorial band. There is a nice article at phys.org with a video, which can also be seen in YouTube. It shows the intensity of HI as a cut in radial velocity is slowly scanned through the data set. $URL$ Since the stackexchange YouTube option is not turned on in astronomy stackexchange, here is a GIF of screenshots at -30, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, and 30 km/sec:
