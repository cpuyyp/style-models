I am employed in UK and I am on sick leave, certified by a GP. What restrictions do I have during this period, in terms of things I can/cannot do? I am not talking about blatantly unprofessional things, like consulting for another company while sick, but things like going out for a walk during work hours when at home sick. EDIT: In some countries you have to stay at home at certain hours during the day, independently from your sickness (flu/broken arm/depression). I am trying to understand if in UK it's the same. 

We all have our "territories" and tasks/responsibilities we want to protect. I once observed somebody saying "this data is mine, this other analyst can't have it", and that data led to very interesting results. Now I find myself being the informal lead on some customer interactions, but some of my colleagues are very "enthusiastic" and are happy to reach out directly to customers in my territory. However, I am remote and they are not. My colleagues are brilliant, but I want to keep coordinating work for these customers to support a promotion in a future leadership role. Should I systematically "stop them there", or let everybody contribute freely? How important is it for my career to stop my colleagues from taking initiative with things I am following? 

My current employer is known to have a below average pay scale. My current salary is 5% less than my last job, and there is a mantra about the company not having enough money. Lots of money is being spent for certain equipment, and there are some very nice cars parked outside, but software development is not a priority. For my role, public institutions would pay as much as 13% more in UK, and private companies would pay 50K to 70K depending on seniority. The impression I have is that I am getting a random 1000 GBP of raise at the end of the year, despite me having a unique role in the company and being highly requested. So, my question is: when the employer is knowingly underpaying a critical resource, should one mention the market value or is it a taboo? Actually, is a low payscale a taboo in general for discussions? 

Lore: I am experiencing difficulties working with my line manager. He's involving me in useless meetings, he feels threatened by my presence after lying about his own expertise and he's trying hard to make sure that I work in isolation, so that he can intercept all my communications and make himself a part of the creative process. My boss already got demoted once just before I joined the company. He previously made a favour to the husband of his current line manager, and this person is protecting him despite the demotion and several hr reports, including discussing a new hire salary in front of his future colleagues. Problem: I would like to get help from my manager's manager, but she will support him by default. Above her, there is a C-level manager and he will just tell me to buzz off. Question: how can I get help with a line manager when there is no hope in his own line? 

I work remotely for a US startup. I am in the field as BizDev minion. I have a senior colleague who travels all around. I don't report to him, but senior management contacts him all the time for our region. My collegue, on the other hand, always involves me EXCEPT when somebody from the US is availably, then he forgets I exist. I talk to customers on a daily basis. However, when senior managers talk to my customers they don't involve me, and they don't let me know what's going on. And my colleague says "oh, but you were busy, right?". I had embarassing conversations like "did your company talk to my colleague X?" "no, this is the first time we ever talk". Indeed, some VP, US based, did contact a company I had planned to visit, without telling me. I am at the point where I have to beg to be involved in certain conversations with customers. I might do the first contact, but once senior management gets involved I lose visibility. I want to grow into a key role for my region, but the lack of involvement worries me. How do I get senior management to include me when dealing with customers in my region? More broadly, how do I convince a senior manager to give me more consideration? I can't really order somebody to pay me attention and "respect me"... 

I am current employed as a bioinformatician. My contract says: "you are employed as a [role],to report to and carry out the instructions of the supervisor [manager]. Based on this agreement, you will be given tasks from time to time". My biggest complaint with my current manager is that he treats me like his private property. This text actually sounds like I AM his private property. My question is: is this kind of role description normal/expected in UK? If it's not, would I be legitimately allowed to ask for something different, and how should it read? 

I am wondering if it'd be preferable to just build a solid CV and get a better job elsewhere, systematically. You do your thing, you build a strong profile and you get a higher level job. My question is: in the real world, is changing jobs preferable to grinding in the same place for several years? 

I am part of a remote team. The person I support is not exactly popular, and the central office is trying to hire somebody loyal to them. As part of the change, our work is being effectively sabotaged: we are being given contradictory directives and cuts to our resources, to the point where there will be a bigger case to bring change. However, I don't want company and customers to suffer because of this. But I don't know what is the professional way of dealing with this without skipping the next couple levels of management. In any situation like this, where a department is artificially put in a difficult position to justify changes, what is the professional course of action? (this question can be applied to most companies, I believe) 

My company (< 300) is currently offering below-market wages, no shares, no bonuses, no raises, with the constant promise of "opportunities for growth" as the company develops. Plus, we are quite top-heavy, and each time we make an acquisition we bring in a bunch of new directors. I see no future, but I have no experience and I might be wrong. In startups, is it common to offer just a fixed salary over several years? Or is it a red flag? 

I have a colleague with whom I started talking more and more. I am the only developer and often I ended up having lunch only with this person. We talk a lot, I like the person but I am starting to worry about boundaries, i.e. where the friendly behaviour should stop. We are very friendly, but I feel that anything I say could be used against me. My question is: how should one handle pseudo-friends at work in terms of boundaries and communication? 

I am working on a company-wide communication about a big project (custom software)) I am delivering. I never did something like this, and I am no communications expert. I need to reach out to technical and commercial people, having the biggest possible impact. Format, content, length, language, details... there must be some basic rules. What guidelines should I follow to maximise the positive impact of a company-wide communication about my work? 

In a company, if a manager says "I am budgeting X for this employee because of this business case", is it still possible that this employee will be made redundant later on because there is no work? 

I am in a positive relationship with my manager, however I wonder what the boundaries should be. What topics should be discussed? Holidays? Family? Or just work? And how much trust should be allowed? My manager will always have his own best interest, first, no matter how like he/she likes me. I am trying to understand how to build a positive relationship with my manager, without backfiring or worse. 

I work remotely for a US company. I do customer support, training, onboarding; presales, lead generation, identification of potential collaborators; project management and keeping track of everything that is going on in the region, including dozens of projects and more than 50 customers. I also represent the company in the region, as there's nobody else to physically attend events, unless they fly somebody over. Despite me running all over the place, I don't have a senior role in the company. The company is growing, and now we hired even more experienced people for functions like marketing and sales. In the US, the new execs have already hired people they previously worked with, pushing down some of my older colleagues (but presenting their slides at strategy meetings!). I am afraid that the same execs will eventually split my tasks among people they will hire, leaving me with nothing to do but (maybe) customer support. To get established and diminish the chance of being "eaten away", I think I would need to take ownership of my work and list projects and achievements. Note that when my work leads to something serious, execs get involved or fly over, and I don't get involved or updated any further. My question is: running all over the place as a "non-senior" remote employee, how can I take ownership of my work and get established? 

When one of my projects (business relationships) becomes interesting or profitable, senior management starts getting involved and I lose track of what I started. Now my own territory is growing nicely thanks to my technical work and business skills, and they are thinking of bringing in a friend of the senior management to take over, leaving me to support this person. Losing track of what I successfully started, I am finding it difficult to build a career. How can I prevent senior management from taking over my projects? There must be a standard way, as people do have careers... 

BG: I provide a global function at my company. Some clique (not global) is currently recruiting my replacement. I am supposed to be leading a new, global function but this guy will be mirroring my role for a specific department. I have been contacted from some candidates: I am the only software developer around and they want to know how my experience has been so far. These people range from clueless to jacks of all trades. I won't be managing this guy, and once she/he arrives he/she will find a highly political and confusing situation. My question is: in this mess, what can I say to people who directly contact me to have information about my role and my experience? I think that any developer with a brain would want to know about the experience of the only available developer... 

Subject: A jack of all trades (and master of none), in a technology company (for this question) would be somebody who is familiar with most relevant technologies and keeps up to date with them without being the best expert around. Question: in a technology company (IT, software, biotech), what are the career paths for a "jack of all trades"? I am talking about traditional job roles where this background is a competitive advantage. Another way of phrasing it is: are there career paths where being a jack of all trades is desirable? 

History says that my next steps up the ladder are being kept warm for others. My question is: when one wants to develop his/her career in situations like this (small startups making acquisitions), is it worth staying, and why? (I don't expect arbitrary solutions, I am hoping for common knowledge like "when companies merge they always create redundancies") 

I am interested in making the jump to a more senior role, e.g. Director, from a senior technical role. However, I can see two paths for promotion: 1) you look after your manager, and once she gets promoted she will remember you and you will move up the ranks together 2) the ping-pong method: two years at a company, if you don't get promoted (or at least a raise) seek a better role somewhere else Right now I am in a situation like 1), but my manager is interested in getting promoted and hiring an old friend for her current role. Other execs are doing the same: pushing the existing team for success, and then once they get established they hire their friends under them. I am full of ideas, suggestions and solutions about how the company might improve, but I am usually shot down by my own manager whenever I try to discuss things beyond my technical role. Basically, I am valuable to her, but I need to stay where I am to support her own plans. And the same happens to even more senior people with some new execs. All these execs are not going up anytime soon (just promoted, or recently joined). How do I actually get into a more senior role? I am at a loss here. Especially because it's not black and white, I am treated well but there is NO career plan in sight. 

peers: other developers or commercial staff, who have a minimum technical background and want to contribute a little to put their name on the project. In the most extreme case, these people expect me to develop software which will let them get some fancy tables to present as their own contribution; managers: in the best case they recognise the benefit and they want to be involved, in the worst case they add themselves to the project to create more "discussions" contributing nothing but delaying things. 

I am trying to understand where my career could go in the near future; I have no experience of big organisations and I work in a small company where I am a specialist with no formal responsibilities. (Edit: my role involves developing software for analysing clinical data. When I started this job I bought the servers, wrote the pipelines, created processes and data policies, etc.) My company is a small startup which likes acquisitions. We have several senior managers who are under 40 years old and were C-level managers of some small startups we acquired. We will probably acquire a software development company in the near future; if this goes like the last few times, this acquisition will bring in: 

I found a new job with nice and talented colleagues. My salary got a huge increase. I can't wait to start the new job. However, my notice period is of several months and I completely lost any and all motivation. I want to avoid burning bridges, but I have zero ambition left for my current job and I would rather move on today. I do not look forward going back into that office, and I have no enthusiasm about future plans. I felt uncomfortable before, and even more now that I got another job. How to get through a lengthy notice period, without burning bridges, in these conditions? 

My line manager does not have any computational skills: no advanced data analysis, no scripting, no programming. Recently he switched the frequency of our meetings to weekly (from one every 2 weeks) and he wants to check my code week after week. Background: he's not technical and he's mainly trying to monopolise access to my technical expertise, e.g. if you want to use technology X you must go through me. But other people have been very happy about my work and nobody else ever complained. He doesn't really know anything about software development. I think that he wants to control my code by either counting the lines or giving it to some friend of his who will tell him "this sucks, pay me and I will do it for less". I think that giving him access to my code will only slow me down. Should I allow my manager to do this? 

I work for a startup which recently hit the "100 employees" mark. We have brought in senior managers from other companies, including competitors. These new people are introducing more structure (and it's probably a good thing), but they are also creating new management roles which are being filled with their old colleagues. This is happening at all levels, from C-execs hiring VPs who reported to them in the past, to engineering team leaders hiring their old team. In all of this, staff who worked at this startup for many years is not getting promoted or given more responsibilities. In fact, 90% of our engineers left or were pushed out. I understand that this is good for the senior managers, e.g. "I have a target to reach, I feel more confident with people I already know". But, the startup is losing most of its previous staff, from engineers to executives. So, my question is: Is this process an integral part of how startups develop (new senior management replacing staff and giving promotions to old colleagues)? And if this is the case, how should one plan a career in a startup, if there is a deadline when your work will help bring somebody who'll replace you? Note: I am not looking for an ad-hoc answer, I want to know if this is EXPECTED and COMMON for any growing technology startup. 

I am currently working on a few high profile projects which are highly interesting for the company. I am observing lots of interest from my colleagues, and as projects start getting steam and first results come in there is more and more people who want to be in the loop, participate in meetings and contribute. I can see at least two types of self-invited contributors:
