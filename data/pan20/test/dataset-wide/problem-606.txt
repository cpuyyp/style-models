Bacteria need nutrients to grow, and plain water doesn't have any. So all that's needed is a rinse with clean water and air drying. There's really no reason for all this sterilization stuff. It accomplishes virtually nothing other than making you feel tidy. However, if you add stuff to the bottle that contains nutrients, such as sports drinks, then the bottle needs some soap and hot water after each use. Nothing extravagant, just the same level of cleaning you would do for dishes or glassware. 

Well, I tried soaking it with WD40 and then re-lubing it with spray lithium grease. No improvement whatsoever. So I took it to the LBS, which declared it DOA. They say they've seen this before with Shimano shifters. Some internal part gets even slightly bent and the shifter fails completely. And they're not really serviceable, so that means replace it. This was a one-month old high-end shifter. It was never damaged or misused. Next bike will sport SRAM or Campy components. They use half as many parts, work just as well, and can be field serviced. So thanks for the answers. UPDATE: Contrary to what I'd been told about eBay purchases, Shimano honored the warranty and replaced the shifter. I spoke to a customer service rep about it first because I was told I needed an RMA to return it, but that's not true either. Simply fill out the warranty form available on their web site and ship the item to them with the completed form. 

I have a 2008 Specialized Allez with a triple crankset. The large and middle rings were getting worn so I bought replacements of identical tooth counts for them. However, after installing them I found it was impossible to shift onto the largest ring no matter how I adjusted the front derailleur because the space between the middle and largest rings was just too wide. So I removed the rings and compared them. The new large ring was identical to the old one but the middle ring was not. The tabs where the bolt holes are drilled in the old ring were thinner than the new ring. The result was this made the middle ring stand about 2 mm farther from the large ring, just enough to make shifting upward impossible. Is it standard for middle chainrings on a triple to be thinner or was that just unique to the crankset used on the bike? (It was the stock, unnamed crankset installed by Specialized.) 

That does look like scuff marks from installing it, but I agree you wouldn't find them all the way around. It may be the tube was twisted and when you inflated it, it untwisted and scraped itself against the bead. Try dusting your inner tubes with talcum powder before installing them. The talc will lubricate the tube and allow it to move freely against the tire and rim without scuffing. 

I can't imagine any reason not to lube a part that's going to be pressed into place. It will make the pressing easier with less damage to the materials and there's no way it will lead to the part sliding out somehow. Parts that are designed to be pressed into place need a whole lot more than lube to be pushed out of place. 

I think it was downright irresponsible of the shop to sell you a bike that so obviously doesn't fit you. They should have done at least some basic fit testing, which clearly they did not. The trouble is, you're at their mercy now. Since it's not a warranty issue, they're not obligated to exchange it. So I would be very polite in how I asked, and I'd make sure I asked the manager or owner, not some 18-year old sales guy. But if they say no, I would push harder. If they still refuse, I'd get a lot less polite and make it clear I would be very vocal about my displeasure with friends and the biking community, including online sources such as yelp.com. I would then sell the bike while you can describe it as virtually brand new, and go to another shop that will fit you properly. 

Those are cantilever brakes and as long as the cables are still intact, everything works as it should and the pads still have plenty of material left, they're perfectly fine. From the photo it looks like the pads are still okay, but replacing them can never hurt. A drop of oil on the hinges might not be a bad idea, too. 

No. Absolutely not. And why would it be? Should you run a race through there without getting the residents onboard first? Of course not. (And who would?) But taking a bike ride through residential areas? Why would anyone object? And if they do, how could it possibly be labeled unreasonable for a cyclist to come down the street at 10-20 mph when cars come down it all the time at 20-40 mph? Pretend you live there and ask yourself which one you want coming down your street at their maximum speed and recklessness. I'd take a peloton of drunken idiots on bikes over a single car. The former could be merely entertaining, but the latter rather lethal. 

With the usual disclaimers that I'm not a doctor, etc, it sounds like you strained an intercostal muscle when you hit the pothole. Intercostal muscles are the muscles between your ribs; they assist in breathing, which explains why you experience pain with deep breaths. As with any muscle strain, the only cure is time and resting the muscle. Wrapping your chest with an elastic bandage might help. Consulting the sports doctor would be better than asking me, but my bet is he'll tell you the same thing. But to answer your actual bike question, I don't think it has anything to do with bike fit. It's a physical injury. 

I have a Garmin 800 which includes heart rate in addition to speed and elevation. Heart rate tells it what my actual level of effort is, so that should take wind and all those other variables into account. It also knows my age, gender and weight, so with all that data it should be able to estimate calories burned pretty closely, or at least as closely as is possible outside a laboratory. Well, according to my Garmin I should lose almost 20 pounds every year during riding season. Sadly, I must report that hasn't happened yet. Not even close. Yes, my calorie intake and levels of other activities during riding season remain the same, so if I'm burning, say, 3500 calories per week riding my bike like Garmin says, then I should be losing a pound a week, give or take*. In practice, though, I find that I lose maybe 5 pounds over the entire season, which is 75% less than Garmin predicted. 

I can inflate my car tires to proper pressure by checking them once a month or so and inflating them as needed using free air. It takes me maybe 5 minutes per month. I can inflate my bike tires to proper pressure by checking them once a week or so and inflating them as needed using free air. It takes me maybe 2 minutes per week. There is no strategy of using alternative gasses that can even remotely compete with that in terms of economy, time or convenience. 

I replaced the no-name brake calipers on my bike with Ultegras today. Am I correct in thinking the rear brake housing is too long and needs to be shortened? And if so, how do I determine how much to remove other than trial and error? (With one of the errors being too much.) 

I patched both tubes yesterday, partially inflated them, and let them sit overnight (without being in a tire). One of them was flat today, so I tossed it as probably having an unseen slow leak not worth finding. The other one I remounted and rode 40 miles today without problem. So apparently either: 1) I somehow damaged the second tube mounting it, or 2) there was something in the tire I never saw or felt on inspection and it fell out without me noticing. 

You could reduce weight even more by simply losing a few grams of weight yourself. So unless you live in a place with no significant hills and never plan to sell the bike, it makes no sense to remove it. Just put it on the big chainring and leave it there. The presence of a derailleur costs you nothing. 

For use at home, there's no question that separate keys are more useful and more economical. A multi-tool has limitations that make it cumbersome to use in tight spots because all the keys are attached to the tool. Separate keys suffer no such limitation. Separate keys can be bought and replaced individually and very inexpensively -- not so with a multi-tool. I wouldn't buy the ridiculously expensive set of keys you show in your post. Just buy the keys you actually need. Drop by any local hardware or automotive parts store and buy the hex keys you actually need. They are inexpensive and should last a lifetime as long as you don't buy the cheapest thing they have. Like all tools, it pays to buy quality. Although you can buy them online, I prefer to buy tools where mechanics buy them. Automotive supply shops such as NAPA in the US are usually your best bet. They cater to mechanics so they won't sell cheap crap. Torque: There's no way you'll ever produce correct torque with a multi-tool unless you're an experienced mechanic who "knows by feel" from thousands of repair jobs. Individual wrenches are also longer and give you more torque than a multi-tool. If you need even more torque in order to remove things like pedals, you just use a bit of pipe to add leverage. I keep a narrow piece of steel pipe about 12 inches long in my toolbox just for this. You just slip it over the long end of the Allen key and it gives you all the torque you'll ever need. Some people prefer the wrenches with plastic handles attached such as those made by Park Tools, but that's purely a matter of personal preference. I prefer plain wrenches with no handles on them since the handle means it can only be used in one orientation, not two like a wrench without a handle. Losing them: My set of Allen wrenches dates to the 70s. I don't understand how you lose tools from your own garage. But on the road? Yeah, sure, I carry a multi-tool like everyone else; but your question was about home use. 

A short length of foam pipe insulation should do the job. It's cheap, will fit into your pocket, and you can get it at any hardware store or plumbing supply shop. You could also slide it onto your top, down, or seat tube for storage. It looks like this: 

You say you've got a small apartment that can't accommodate two bikes, but how about two sets of wheels? The only thing that can deal with ice is studded tires, so for those 20% of the days that include ice, you need studded tires. Your Tricross should be able to accommodate such wheels, so it would simply be a matter of changing wheels rather than buying a whole new bike or using transit. As for those days it seems okay in the morning but turns into an icy day in the evening, all I can suggest is paying careful attention to the weather guessers and guessing conservatively. 

Those slices are directly opposite the valve stem, and a careful re-inspection of the tire and wheel at that location revealed nothing. But as you can see, they're quite large slices. I might suspect a faulty tube if it were just one slice, but two? That seems extremely unlikely to be a faulty tube. I know no one can tell me exactly what happened, so my question is what are the possibilities? What the heck could have made cuts that large that occurred without even riding on the wheel and which couldn't be felt with my fingers on inspection? 

Choose the size based on the type of pedals you use. Platform pedals will require a larger diameter and clipless pedals a smaller diameter. You want it big enough so you can easily slide it over the pedal but small enough that it stays put. 

I have Ultegra 3x9 shifters and derailleurs that were installed just a couple months ago. I purchased them on eBay and although they were new, they had been sitting in inventory for a couple years so not "new" in that sense. New cabling was used when they were installed. Today my rear shifter suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. When I attempt to shift up to a smaller cog, the entire brake lever moves with the trigger, so they basically cancel each other out. I inspected the cables and derailleur and everything seems fine. Shifting still works perfectly if I hold the brake lever so it doesn't move with the trigger, and downshifting to larger cogs works fine also. This tells me it's probably the shifter itself, not cabling or derailleur. Googling around I find many posts advising the use of WD-40 to free up a sticky shifter. The idea is that the grease Shimano uses hardens with age and WD-40 will clean it out. Two questions: 

Everyone else has offered good advice, but let me point out one simple thing for you: Almost no matter how hot it is or how hard I'm riding, I'm not really sweaty until I stop moving. That's because 1) I'm wearing bike clothes designed to wick moisture and evaporate it quickly, and 2) almost no matter what the weather is doing, while I'm moving I'm headed into a steady wind that quickly evaporates sweat. But when I stop, that steady wind stops and with it the evaporation, and all of a sudden I'm sweaty when I wasn't 10 seconds earlier. So just do three things: 1) Wear sports clothing designed to wick moisture. 2) Slow down and cool down a kilometer or so before you reach work. Cruise around in slow circles in the parking lot if you must until you can stop and not feel sweaty. 3) Bring a change of clothing and once you've cooled down and stopped sweating, head for the bathroom and change. Evaporated sweat doesn't smell. Only old sweat that has lingered and had time to allow bacteria and fungi to grow smells. So go ahead and sweat but just make sure you're dry when you change into your work clothing.
