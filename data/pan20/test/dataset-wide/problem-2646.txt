A monad is a mathematical construct. Generally speaking, it is not typical to assume humans are mathematical constructs. However, it may be valid to argue that you are "well modeled as a monad." This would be to say that a great deal of explanatory value can come from modeling yourself as a monad. Later, if you decide you are "perfectly modeled as a monad," then the next layer of ontology comes into play, as you ask "if I am perfectly modeled as a monad, am I, in fact, a monad?" Personally, I find I am too imperfect to fit into such a crystal clear mathematical construct, so I would not say I am a monad. Maybe, on a good day, you could model me as one. Whether you are sufficiently perfect to be a monad is up to you. 

You've had some interesting quotes from that introductory philosophy book. In this case, the author seems to have believed they built up enough of an argument that they can issue a statement like (3) and presume the reader will bother actually working through the proof for them. In this case, it appears the author is starting from the assumption that you can draw a boundary around a "self," dividing the universe into a Self and its Environment. In such a system of thought, the argument is that the only things one really wants are in the "self." However, this implies that individuals care nothing for the state of their environment, only their internal state. Concerns for external state of the Environment around the Self are presumed to always be proxies for a desire for something within the Self. Thus desires regarding the Environment are caused by desires in the Self. There are approaches to this interaction which suggest there is no problem here. Some might challenge the causality, some might challenge intent. Some might argue that people in fact do want to change the environment for change's sake. Some, like Arne Naess, may use definitions of the Self which are inherently so all encompassing that it becomes reasonable to assume all springs from the Self. It appears the author does not consider any of these approaches. The author appears to assume there is only one possible definition of Self, a narrow one, which one might presume the author believes is the true meaning. If you assume this narrow meaning, phrases like "entirely wrong" start to develop merit. However, if one wishes to explore other philosopher's opinions on the Self, brutal negative phrases like "entirely wrong" will just get in the way. 

You did not specify a formal meaning for your terminology, so we have to do some guesswork. Believe it or not, the precise meaning of the word "in" matters here. When one starts exploring the largest (or smallest) limits of a way of thinking, as you are, the funniest words become surprisingly important. One valid meaning is to refer to space in either a Newtonian sense, or a relativistic sense such as spacetime. In these cases, space is not actually a "thing." Rather it is the domain upon which the equations of physics are applied. If one did not desire to calculate the trajectory of objects, one would not need a spacetime to make sense of the universe. Another valid meaning is mathematical. For me, your question immediately conjures up visions of set theory. I can treat all of your propositions as set theoretic phrases. "We are in a house" could be , or "'we' is an element of 'house'". These can continue forth with * and , but what is space an element of? Can we write if we fill in the question marks with the right thing? Potentially, or potentially not. We can always construct a new set which contains space, and everything in it. We could even give it a name, like "superspace" or "megaspace" or "user17325's thing bigger than space itself" However, this almost certainly not the direction your question was going. You want to know what is bigger than "everything." Well, that gets to be complicated. In set theory, there is the concept of U, the "universe of all sets." However, some complications arise here. U is not actually a set, itself. It is a category. There is nothing that "contains" U because U cannot be an element in any set. Sets can only contain other sets (in most set theories, anyways). Since U is a category, it cannot be contained in a set. This sort of distinction becomes important because there's all sorts of paradoxes that arise if one tries to presume U is a set. The most famous is Russel's Paradox. Russel's paradox arises when one seeks to use a naive assumption that all definable collections are sets. If this were true, U would be a set, because it is defined to be "a collection of everything." However, this definition creates a paradox: Let's define two types of sets: tail chasing sets and normal sets. A tail chasing as a set which contains itself, like a dog chasing its tail. Clearly U would have to be such a tail chasing set, if it is indeed a set itself. Normal sets are those which do not contain themselves. These are the well behaved sets we're used to, such as {1, 2, 3} {{12}, {3, 4}}. Since we defined these two types, we can define two sets by them: the set of tail chasing sets, and the set of normal sets. But which set is the set of normal sets part of? Is it tail chasing, or normal? If it is normal, then it must contain itself, thus it is tail chasing. If it is tail chasing, then it does not contain itself, thus it must be normal. This is a contradiction, and it is this contradiction that shows that our assumptions are invalid. As it is, the "collection of all normal sets," which is clearly either U or a subset of U, is not a set at all. They coined the word "class" to describe these concepts. U is a class, not a set. So this is where your question can lead, using modern science and math. One can take other approaches as well, if desired. The Chinese have the concept of the Dao. Everything is part of the dao. However, if one asks what the dao is a part of, the question falls apart. It becomes hard to construct phrases related to your question. The most common response I have seen is "the dao is," and it is left at that. It also could be turtles all the way down. * I'm handwaving away some technicalities in set theory. In the strictest sense, if and does not entail in all cases. However it is possible to construct my sets for "we" "house" "earth" and "space" such that this relationship does in fact hold. For the exact construction, see von Neuman ordinals as a well respected formal construction that uses this approach. This distinction will only be important if you continue exploring set theory, and is not really required to understand the rest of the answer. 

Abduction is the key word for understanding the approach they take. Scientists have gotten in the habit of speaking about their discoveries as ontological truths, such as "The Higgs Boson exists." In actuality, their data merely suggests that they have observed data which fits well with their model in a region of the state-space which could have potentially falsified their theory. However, science has received enough trust from the people that they are permitted to make such ontological truths. They are not the only ones. For example, the Christians are permitted to say "He is risen" when one might have required them to say "I believe he is risen." Abduction is the inference to the best hypothesis. It is saying "out of all the possibilities I can think of, hypothesis A fits the data so much better than any other hypothesis that I am going to presume A is actually true." Making this assumption is very tricky, and many are not even aware they are making it! Physical Cosmologists are proposing models for how our universe works. If one of them shows great promise, they may change their wording to start suggesting it as an ontological truth. This is perhaps justified by the fact that English is a messy language, and one may use syntax associated with ontology to express semantics which are empirical in nature. If at some point they truly believe their model is correct, then they have engaged in abduction. 

The answers to these questions depend on how you think about consciousness. The key challenge is this phrase: 

The key issue here is tying physical events into mathematical concepts. Mathematically, the probability of drawing a 1 from a uniform distribution between 1 and 6 is 1/6. Period. Why? Because that's the definition of a random variable with a uniform distribution between 1 and 6. The hard part is arguing why that random variable is a useful model of a die. For that, we have an unfortunate definition in mathematics: If you threw the die an infinite number of times, you would see that it landed on a 1 exactly 1/6 of the time. The feasibility of throwing a die an infinite number of times is, of course, questionable at best. There is a mathematical tool for this, which makes me surprised Mathematics.SE sent you here. Stats.SE would have been a good place too. The tool is called a p-value. It's a powerful tool which tells you how likely it was that a particular result occurred. So if you roll a die 18 times, and see 5 1's, it can tell you how "unusual" that event was. Generally speaking, for Casino dice, the random variable is a very good model. The house always wins, but to do so they need to be confident that the dice they put on the table are sufficiently well modeled as random so that they can use these statistical laws to fleece your purse. They have a fiscal interest in making sure these dice are very random. For computerized games, it's the same: the house wants it to be very random. The algorithms used in these games go through incredibly strict statistical testing to ensure they are highly random. In many states, the algorithms used are audited by the state. In all cases, however, we don't prove a probability. We assume that a random variable is a good model of the physical game we are playing, and then we do testing (a. la. the scientific method) to develop confidence in that model. Or, we rely on greed, and make sure that someone else (i.e. The House) has a fiscal incentive to make the game random. 

Finding the meaning of Wuwei in English may be a fool's errand. The Chinese have volumes of philosophy on the word, in their own language. One should not expect an easy "meaning" of the word in English. However, it is very possible to explain varying other subjects which are closely related to Wuwei, and permit yourself to amalgamate them as part of your search for its meaning. One such related subject I can offer is the idea of not acting because one has put oneself in a position to not need to act. Consider a case where you are a supervisor managing several employees. One employee does something disrespectful to the other. An action might be to reprimand the employee, telling them what they should do. However, this action may have unintended consequences. You could build ill will within your group. After all, now the entire group knows that tattling to mommy/daddy works. Not acting would be letting the situation go. The two employees do whatever they do, and you wash your hands of the issues. Perhaps one of them leverages a lawsuit against your company. That's okay, it's their fault. You did no action, so there were no consequences for an action you took. It's all everyone elses' fault. Acting without acting would be very similar to "not acting," but with a slight twist. If you have previously been engaging with your employees, and you are aware of their temperament, you may decide there's a good chance that they can work the issue out on their own. However, you don't merely wash your hands of the issue. You stay in contact with it, observing the interactions between the two. If it ever looks like the situation will spiral out of control into a lawsuit, you can act to mitigate the situation. However, even when you do have to act, you do so minimally. You don't try to solve the problem as much as maintain an environment for the others to solve the problem between themselves. The two key takeaways from this example related to Wuwei are: 

Freedom of speech is specifically the freedom from legal action in response to your speech. It is not a freedom from all consequences. In fact, in realistic implementations, such as those in the USA, freedom of speech is limited. There are things which can draw legal action by being said (libel, threats of violence, etc.). Freedom of speech is important in a government which prides itself on following rules. Many governments explicitly put more power in the rules than in the people enforcing the rules. The logic is simple: people may not be trusted, but rules are rules. If a government is unable to punish you for your speech because they officially have "free speech," then they are forced to find other reasons/ways to punish you. This process is much harder than simply throwing you in jail for your speech directly, so it provides a key check for these governments.
