This answer is just an elaboration of Ramiro de la Vega's comment above. In "Chain conditions in maximal models" (which you can find here) Larson and Todorcevic show that after forcing with a Suslin tree, no ladder system (on $\omega_1$) in the extension has the uniformization property. However, there are many models for which there exists a Suslin tree $S$ such that after forcing with $S$, $2^\omega = 2^{\omega_1}$ holds, and hence $\Phi_{\omega_1}$ fails. For instance, a model of $MA(S)$ (the forcing axiom for all ccc posets which preserve $S$) satisfies $2^\omega = 2^{\omega_1}$, and forcing with $S$ does not change this. 

Is it consistent with ZFC that there exists an automorphism of $P(\omega_1)/\mathrm{NS}_{\omega_1}$ which is not the identity? 

A "yes" answer to your question is equivalent to the statement "there exists a large set of natural numbers that admits no arithmetic progression of length three." I'm submitting the proof of this equivalence as an answer since I don't expect to see an actual answer unless it shows up in Annals too :) So, to the proof. You've already noted the forward direction. For the backward direction, suppose $A$ is a large set of natural numbers with no arithmetic progression of length three, $k\in\mathbb{N}$, and $s\subseteq k$ has no arithmetic progressions of length three. We'll show that there's a large set $B$ such that $B\cap k = s$, and $B$ has no arithmetic progressions of length three. This is clearly sufficient. The "naiive" choice for $B$ is the set $s\cup (A\setminus k)$, which is large and has no length-3 AP's which are entirely below $n$ or entirely above $k$; but of course there may be an AP of length 3 which crosses $k$. There are only finitely-many APs of length 3 with two points in $s$, so we may remove the corresponding points from $A$ (if they exist) and still have a large set. So we'll assume that we've already done this, i.e. $A\cap k = \emptyset$, and there are no APs of length 3 with two points in $s$. If the AP has two points in $A$, then it's more complicated. Suppose $i\in s$. Let $B_i$ be the set you get from $A$ by removing the possible third points, i.e. $$ B_i = A\setminus\{2n - i \;|\; n\in A\}$$ We'll show that $B_i$ is still large. Let $N$ be a large natural number. Note that $$ \sum_{n\in B_i\cap N} \frac{1}{n} \ge \sum_{n\in A\cap N} \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2n-i}$$ If $n$ is large enough, say $n > 3i$, then $\frac{1}{2n - i} < \frac{2}{3n}$, so if $A\cap 3k = \emptyset$ then the above sum is at least $$ \sum_{n\in A\cap N} \frac{1}{3n} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{n\in A\cap N} \frac{1}{n} $$ Hence, as the sums on the right go to $\infty$ as $N\to\infty$, it follows that $B_i$ is large. Applying this process multiple times, once for each member of $s$, we eventually get a large set $B$ such that $s\cup B$ has no AP's of length 3. 

It seems that Keesling's 1994 paper "The One-Dimensional Cech Cohomology of the Higson Compactification and Its Corona" contains the required result (Corollary 1). It may have been mis-cited. 

Suppose $D$ is the Dirac operator on a closed spin manifold $M$, with spinors $S$. One can take the functional calculus of $D$ with respect to the continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ given by $x\mapsto\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$. Let's denote this operator by $$f(D):L^2(S)\rightarrow L^2(S),$$ which is now bounded. 

Let us say that a bounded smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ has vanishing variation at infinity (or satisfies "property $A$" for short) if, for any $r\neq 0$, we have $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|} = 0.$$ In particular this means that $$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\left(\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|}\right) = 0.$$ An example of such a function is any smooth function whose gradient vanishes at infinity (or satisfies "property $B$" for short): that is, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\left(\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|}\right) = 0.$$ On the other hand, there are functions satisfying property $B$ that do not satisfy property $A$. One type of example is any smooth function that has a limit as $x\rightarrow\infty$ but whose derivative does not go to zero; however note that such functions can always be approximated in the uniform norm by a sequence of functions satisfying property $A$. Question: can any function satisfying $A$ be approximated in the uniform norm by a sequence of functions satisfying $B$? More precisely: given any $f$ satisfying $A$, can we find a sequence of functions $(f_i)$ satisfying $B$ such that for any $\epsilon > 0$, $||f-f_i||_\infty<\epsilon$ for all $i$ sufficiently large? 

Suppose $X$ is a non-compact manifold. Let $P$ be an order-$0$ pseudodifferential operator on $X$ and $f:L^2(X)\rightarrow L^2(X)$ a compact operator. I'm wondering: 1) Is $P + f$ always a pseudodifferential operator? 2) If so, does it have the same principal symbol as $P$? Many thanks. 

If $\mathfrak{p} > \kappa$, then you can get such a $\pi$ for every family of $\kappa$-many bounded sequences. To see this, suppose $\mathfrak{p} > \kappa$, $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are nonprincipal ultrafilters, and $s^\xi\in\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ ($\xi < \kappa$) is a family of bounded sequences. Let $\lambda^\xi$ be the $\mu_1$-limit of $s^\xi$ and let $$ X_n^\xi = \left\{m\in\mathbb{N}\; :\; |s_m^\xi - \lambda^\xi| < \frac{1}{n}\right\} $$ Then each $X_n^\xi$ is a member of $\mu_1$, and hence every intersection of finitely-many of them is infinite. Since $\mathfrak{p} > \kappa$, there is then an infinite set $P$ which is contained (mod-finite) in all of them. Let $\pi$ be any permutation such that $\pi''(P)\in \mu_2$. Then if $t^\xi$ is the rearrangement of $s^\xi$ by $\pi$, we have $t^\xi_m = s^\xi_{\pi^{-1}(m)}$, so $$ Y^\xi_n = \left\{ m\in\mathbb{N}\; :\; |t_m^\xi - \lambda^\xi| < \frac{1}{n}\right\} = \pi''(X^\xi_n) \supseteq^* \pi''(P) $$ and hence all of these $Y^\xi_n$'s are in $\mu_2$, which means that the $\mu_2$-limit of each $t^\xi$ is still $\lambda^\xi$. It would be nice to improve this to a larger cardinal characteristic than $\mathfrak{p}$. EDIT: I think $\mathfrak{u}$ (the minimal size of a base for a nonprincipal ultrafilter) is an upper bound. Let $\mu_1$ be a nonprincipal ultrafilter with a base $\mathcal{B}$ of minimal size. Consider the family of sequences $\chi_A$ ($A\in\mathcal{B}$), where $\chi_A$ is the characteristic function of $A$. The limit of each such $\chi_A$ along $\mu_1$ is $1$. If $\pi$ is a permutation, then the sequence we get by rearranging $\chi_A$ using $\pi$ is exactly $\chi_{\pi^{-1}(A)}$. So, given $\mu_2$, we'd like to find a $\pi$ such that for each $A\in\mathcal{B}$, $\pi^{-1}(A)\in \mu_2$. Clearly this implies that $\pi^{-1}(A)\in \mu_2$ for all $A\in \mu_1$. But this implies that $\mu_2$ is exactly $$ \{\pi^{-1}(A) \; : \; A\in\mu_1\} $$ (If there were some $B\in\mu_2$ not in the above set, then consider $\pi''(B)$. This is not in $\mu_1$ by assumption, hence $\pi''(\mathbb{N}\setminus B) \in \mu_1$, hence $\mathbb{N}\setminus B\in \mu_2$, a contradiction.) So in this case we can only find such a $\pi$ when $\mu_2$ is in the orbit of $\mu_1$ under $S_\mathbb{N}$, and of course this orbit is not all of $\beta\mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$. (There are only continuum-many points in the orbit of $\mu_1$ but $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$-many ultrafilters total.) 

It seems that the idea of the Higson compactification first arose in the context of non-compact manifolds in a 1992 preprint of Higson called "The relative $K$-homology of Baum and Douglas". It seems that this paper was either published under a different name or was not published; it's not on MathSciNet. Does anyone know where I could find a copy of it? Many thanks. Added question: in particular, I'm wondering if Roe's more abstract definition of the Higson compactification in terms of bounded continuous functions of vanishing variation at infinity is equivalent to Higson's original definition in terms of bounded smooth functions with vanishing derivative. More precisely, consider a non-compact Riemannian manifold $M$ as a metric space in the usual way. For any bounded continuous function $f$ on $M$, define the variation of $f$ at scale $r$ to be the function $V_r(f):M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ given by $$V_r(f)(x)=\sup\{|f(x)-f(y)|:y\in B_r(x)\}.$$ Then I'd like to know whether the set $$\{f\in C_b(M):\text{ for all }r>0, V_r(f)(x)\rightarrow 0\text{ as } x\rightarrow\infty\}$$ is the same as the set $$\overline{\{f\in C_b^\infty(M):|df(x)|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }x\rightarrow\infty\}}$$ where the closure is taken in $C_b(M)$ with the sup norm. I think it is clear that the second set without the closure lies inside the first set, but other than this I'm not sure. 

Part 1 of question: I've seen it implicitly written that the index of $D$ is unchanged by this modification. Why is this true (perhaps from a functional calculus perspective)? Part 2 of question: Is it possible to see that the index of $D$ is unchanged using the integral expression $$f(D)\psi = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^\infty D(D^2+1+\lambda^2)^{-1}\psi\,\,d\lambda?$$ For instance, if $D$ is invertible as an operator $H^1\rightarrow L^2$ (where $H^1$ is the first Sobolev space), with inverse $D^{-1}:L^2\rightarrow H^1$, can we write down an inverse for $f(D):L^2\rightarrow L^2$ using an integral expression that involves $D^{-1}$? 

Edit: Since it seems the answer to the above question might be a little far off at the moment, let me ask a weaker question that I'm also interested in: Question: Suppose $S$ is stationary and $L$ is a ladder system on $S$ which has $2$-uniformization. Let $f_\alpha : L_\alpha\to \omega$ be the collapse map. Does there exist an $F : \omega_1\to \omega$ such that for all $\alpha\in S$, $F\upharpoonright L_\alpha =^* f_\alpha$? Note that, given $\diamondsuit(S)$, there exists a ladder system on $S$ such that the above "canonical" $\omega$-coloring (i.e. the coloring given by the collapse maps) has no uniformization; hence if the answer is yes, then it must come somehow from the $2$-uniformization property of the ladder system. 

No. Note that in the space $X = (\omega, \mathcal{U}\cup\{\emptyset\})$, every set is either open or closed. However in the space $X^2$, neither $\overline{\Delta} = \{(m,n) : n\ge m\}$ nor $\underline{\Delta} = \{(m,n) : n < m\}$ can be open, since neither of these sets contains a rectangle of the form $A\times B$ with $A,B\in\mathcal{U}$. 

Let $S \subseteq \omega_1$ be a stationary set of limit ordinals and let $L = \langle L_\alpha \;|\; \alpha\in S\rangle$ be a ladder system. We say that $L$ has $\kappa$-uniformization if for every sequence of functions $f_\alpha : L_\alpha\to \kappa$ ($\alpha\in S$), there is a function $F : \omega_1\to\kappa$ such that for every $\alpha\in S$, $F\upharpoonright L_\alpha =^* f_\alpha$, i.e. $F$ and $f_\alpha$ agree on a cofinite subset of $L_\alpha$. It is known (see Eklof-Mekler-Shelah, Theorem 15) that, if $S$ is stationary and every ladder system on $S$ has $2$-uniformization, then in fact every ladder system on $S$ has $\omega$-uniformization. Question: Suppose $S$ is stationary and $L$ is a ladder system on $S$ which has $2$-uniformization. Does it follow that $L$ has $\omega$-uniformization? 

Suppose $D$ is a Dirac operator acting on sections of a bundle $E$ over a manifold $M$, and define the Sobolev spaces $H^i(E)$ via the inner products $$\langle e_1,e_2\rangle_{H^i}:=\sum_{k=0}^i\langle D^k e_1,D^k e_2\rangle_{H^0},$$ where $e_1,e_2\in C_c^\infty(E)$. Then the closure $\overline{D}$ of $D$ is a bounded operator $H^1(E)\rightarrow H^0(E)$. When $E$ is a vector bundle, $H^i(E)$ are Hilbert spaces, hence $\overline{D}$ is guaranteed to have an adjoint $\overline{D}^*:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$. More generally, when $E$ is a bundle of Hilbert $A$-modules over some $C^*$-algebra $A$, it is still said in the literature (see for instance part 1 of Bunke's 1995 paper on Callias-type operators) that $\overline{D}^*$ also exists, even though one knows that in general, bounded operators need not be adjointable. It seems to me that if $s\in H^1(E)$ and $t\in H^0(E)$, we have $$\langle\overline{D}s,t\rangle_{H^0} = \langle s,\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}t\rangle_{H^1},$$ and so it looks like $\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$ would be the adjoint, except that the existence of $(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}$ means that $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, which is true many cases but in general needs to be proved (and which is something that people often state after declaring $\overline{D}$ to be bounded adjointable). Question -1: Is the above expression for $\overline{D}^*$ correct when $D$ is essentially self-adjoint? Question 0: How does one show, without knowing $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, that $\overline{D}$ is adjointable? (Is there an argument using pseudo-differential calculus, for instance?) 

My question concerns a statement on page 12 of the following paper of Baum, Connes, and Higson: $URL$ about the definition of the $G$-index map from the $G$-equivariant $K$-homology group $K_0^G(X)$ to $K_0(C_r^*(G))$, where $X$ is a proper $G$-compact $G$-manifold. Suppose $(H_+,H_-,F)$ is a $G$-equivariant abstract elliptic operator on $X$ (defined on the previous page of the same paper), so that $H_+$ and $H_-$ are Hilbert spaces equipped with unitary $G$-representations and $G$-covariant representations $\pi_{\pm}$ of $C_0(X)$, and $F$ is a certain bounded $G$-equivariant Hilbert space operator $H_+\rightarrow H_-$ satisfying a list of conditions (page 11). One can complete of the subspace $\pi_{\pm}(C_c(X))H_\pm\subseteq H_\pm$ into a $C_r^*(G)$-module $\mathcal{H}$, as well as complete the operator $F$ into an adjointable operator $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{H}$. It is then stated that "thanks to the axioms for an abstract elliptic operator (and the fact that $X$ is $G$-compact)", $\mathcal{F}$ is in fact a Fredholm operator. I'm looking for some clarification and confirmation on two questions (the first is more of a sanity check): 

If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are irrational, and $$\mathbb{Z} + \alpha \mathbb{Z} + \alpha^2\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z} + \beta \mathbb{Z} + \beta^2 \mathbb{Z}$$ does it follow that one of $\alpha + \beta$ or $\alpha - \beta$ is an integer? For motivation, notice that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are irrational, and $\mathbb{Z} + \alpha\mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z} + \beta\mathbb{Z}$, then one of $\alpha + \beta$ or $\alpha - \beta$ is an integer. Indeed, with these assumptions, we have $\alpha = m + n\beta$ and $\beta = p + q\alpha$ for some integers $m,n,p,q$. But then $\alpha = m + n(p + q\alpha)$, which implies $nq = 1$, since $\alpha$ is irrational. Then $n = \pm 1$, so $\alpha = m \pm \beta$. 

A Suslin line is a linear order $L$ which is dense with no endpoints, complete, and ccc but not separable. I'm wondering what kind of order-preserving maps there are from $L$ into $L$. Specifically, Question: Can there be a Suslin line $L$ such that for every one-to-one, monotonic function $f$ from an uncountable subset of $L$ into $L$, the set of $x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)$ with $f(x)\neq x$ is countable? The motivation for this question is the following. A linear order $L$ is $n$-entangled if for every uncountable set $A$ of pairwise-disjoint $n$-tuples in $L$, and for every $s : n\to 2$, there are $a,b\in A$ such that $a_i < b_i$ if and only if $s(i) = 0$, for all $i < n$. One can show that a linear order $L$ is $2$-entangled if and only if it is rigid, in the sense that every one-to-one, monotonic function on an uncountable subset of $L$ is equal to the identity on a co-countable subset of its domain. It's not difficult to show that a weakening of the Open Coloring Axiom implies there are no $2$-entangled sets of reals. However, OCA is consistent with the existence of a Suslin line. So an answer to the above question would provide evidence for an answer to the following. Question: Is OCA consistent with the existence of a $2$-entangled linear order? Edit: I forgot to mention why entangledness is relevant. A $3$-entangled linear order is necessarily separable, so $2$-entangledness is the most you might possibly get out of a Suslin line.
