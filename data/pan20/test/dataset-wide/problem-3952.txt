Regarding Q2: If and only if $X$ has the approximation property. I'll use Ryan's book "Introduction to tensor products of Banach spaces" as a reference, see Prop 4.6 (but this is all standard stuff). Theorem: $X$ has the approximation property if and only if, whenever $u=\sum_{n\geq 1} \mu_n\otimes x_n \in X^*\hat\otimes X$ is such that $ \sum_n \mu_n(x) x_n = 0$ for all $x\in X$, then $u=0$. As we have $\sum_n \|\mu_n\| \|x_n\|<\infty$, the condition is equivalent to $\sum_n \mu_n(x) \mu(x_n)=0$ for all $x\in X,\mu\in X^*$ (Hahn-Banach) and hence also equivalent to $\sum_n \mu(x_n)\mu_n = 0$ for all $\mu\in X^*$, and so finally also equivalent to $\sum_n \mu(x_n) f(\mu_n) = 0$ for all $\mu\in X^*, f\in X^{**}$. This in turn is equivalent to $\langle u, F \rangle=0$ for all finite rank operators $F$ on $X^*$, under your dual pairing between $X^*\hat\otimes X$ and $F(X^*)$. Finally, observe that $F(X^*)$ is weak$^*$ dense in $B(X^*)$ if and only if the only element of $X^*\hat\otimes X$ which annihilates all of $F(X^*)$ is $0$. There is a related definition of the "compact approximation property". If I recall it correctly, then you can adapt the proof, and get Thm: $X$ has the compact approximation property if and only if, whenever $u=\sum_{n\geq 1} \mu_n\otimes x_n \in X^*\hat\otimes X$ is such that $ \sum_n \langle\mu_n,T(x_n)\rangle = 0$ for all $T\in K(X)$, then $u=0$. Thus, if $X$ has the compact approximation property, but not the approximation property (I think there is an example due to Willis) then we can find $u\in X^*\hat\otimes X$ which annihilates all of $F(X^*)$ but is not zero. There is then $T\in K(X)\subseteq K(X^*)$ with $\langle T,u\rangle \not=0$, and as $$ \overline{F(X^*)}^{wk^*} = \{ T\in B(X^*) : \langle T,u\rangle=0 \text{ for all }u\in X^*\hat\otimes X\text{ with } \langle S,u\rangle=0 \text{ for all } S\in F(X^*) \} $$ we conclude that $K(X)$ is not contained in the weak$^*$-closure of $F(X^*)$. So Q4 is a negative. 

Giving some motivation is hard here, so I'll just ask the question. I want an element $a=(a_n)\in\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$ such that: 

It is more common to just write $L_g$ for $L_{x_g}$. As $L(G)$ admits a finite trace, there is a natural injective map $L(G)$ into $\ell^2(G)$-- this is your map $A \mapsto (\mu_g)$. It is absolutely not true that this map surjects (Open Mapping Theorem). It is obviously sufficient that $(\mu_g)\in\ell^1(G)$ for there to be some $A$ giving rise to $(\mu_g)$. With $G=\mathbb F_2$, one can say a bit more. For example, Haagerup showed in: Haagerup, Uffe An example of a nonnuclear C∗-algebra, which has the metric approximation property. Invent. Math. 50 (1978/79), no. 3, 279–293. See Lemma 1.4 that if $f$ is a function of finite support, then denoting $f_n$ the function which agrees with $f$ on the collection of words of reduced length $n$, and is zero elsewhere, we have that there is $A\in L(G)$ inducing $f$, with $\|A\| \leq \sum_{n\geq 0} (n+1) \|f_n\|_2$. From this, it's easy to construct functions not in $\ell^1(G)$, but which are nonetheless induced by members of $L(G)$. 

where $\mathbb K\alpha_0$ means the span of single element $\alpha_0$ (over whatever field you are using). In particular, $A$ is not norm dense. Suppose now that $x\in X$ is non-zero, but with $\alpha(x)=0$ for all $\alpha\in A$. Then for any $\beta\in X'$ we have that 

This is a long comment (so an answer) which is really just a thank you to Todd Trimble-- this idea of Chu duality (or perhaps, Barr-Chu duality) seems really interesting. For Banach spaces, it basically captures the idea of a "dual pair", which is certainly an idea out there in the literature. But the key difference seems (as ever with category theory!) to worry about the morphisms. So an object is $(E_1,E_2,\langle\cdot,\cdot,\rangle)$ which is a pair of Banach spaces together a bilinear pairing to $\mathbb C$. A morphism $(E_1,E_2,\langle\cdot,\cdot,\rangle)\rightarrow(F_1,F_2,\langle\cdot,\cdot,\rangle)$ is a pair of maps $f:E_1\rightarrow F_1$ and $g:F_2\rightarrow E_2$ which commutes across the pairing: $$ \langle f(x), \mu \rangle = \langle x, g(\mu) \rangle \qquad (x\in E_1, \mu\in F_2). $$ Then you can carry out tensor product, and internal hom-space, constructions. What's remarkable, to me, is that the obvious notion of a module in this setting automatically gives me this concept of "normality"-- something which has always seemed convenient, but slightly ad-hoc. So for that alone, this is a nice discovery! 

There is a 2x2 matrix counter-example. $$ M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad S_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix}, S_2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 2c \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}. $$ Then $$ MS_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 8 \end{pmatrix}, \quad MS_2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 2c \\ 2c & 2d \end{pmatrix} $$ so $MS_1$ is self-adjoint, and $MS_2$ is when $a,c, d\in\mathbb R$. Then $$ S_1S_2 = \begin{pmatrix} a + 2c & 2c+2d \\ a+4c & 2c+4d \end{pmatrix}, \quad S_2S_1 = \begin{pmatrix} a+2c & 2a+8c \\ c+d & 2c+4d \end{pmatrix}. $$ So these commute when $d = a + 3c$. But then $$ MS_2 = \begin{pmatrix} a & 2c \\ 2c & 2a+6c \end{pmatrix} $$ Tediously multiplying out shows these commute only when $a=c$. 

It wasn't clear to me, immediately, how to do the general case, but I think you can use Biorthogonal Systems. Indeed, let $(x_n)\subseteq X$ and $(f_n)\subseteq X^*$ satisfy that $f_n(x_m) = \delta_{n,m}$. Let $(y_n) \subseteq Y$ be a linearly independent sequence. Set $$\tau = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \|x_n\|^{-1} \|y_n\|^{-1} 2^{-n} x_n\otimes y_n \in X \widehat\otimes Y. $$ Suppose, towards a contradiction, that $\tau \in X\otimes Y$. Now, $\tau$ induces a bounded linear map $T:X^*\rightarrow Y$, and by our assumption, $T$ is finite rank. However, clearly $T(f_n) = \|x_n\|^{-1} \|y_n\|^{-1} 2^{-n} y_n$ and so $(T(f_n))$ is a linearly independent sequence, contradicting $T$ being finite rank. To construct $(x_n), (f_n)$ we can follow an old argument due to Markushevich. The argument is not hard, but is a touch long to type out here. The best link I could find was: Biorthogonal Systems in Banach Spaces (Google books). Search for "M-basis". 

Let X be locally compact and Hausdorff, and let $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb R$ be a function. Suppose that for all finite regular (positive) Borel measures $\mu$, we know that $f$ is $\mu$-measurable. Does it follow that $f$ is Borel? If not, what's a good counter-example? Definitions: The Borel sigma-algebra is generated by the open sets. So $f$ is Borel if $f^{-1}(U)$ is Borel for each open $U\subseteq\mathbb R$. I think the definition of $\mu$-measurable is that for each open $U\subseteq\mathbb R$, we have that $f^{-1}(U)$ is in the completed sigma-algebra for $\mu$. That is, we can find Borel sets $A$ and $B$ with $A \subseteq f^{-1}(U) \subseteq B$ with $\mu(B\setminus A)=0$. Remark: The "obvious" measures are the point mass measures, but then the completed sigma-algebra is $2^X$, so all functions are measurable! So the question is, in some sense, whether $X$ supports "enough" finite regular Borel measures. Vague motivation: This old paper of Barry Johnson: Separate continuity and measurability. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 20 1969 420--422 see $URL$ But Barry's paper clearly gives me enough for what I want, so really this question is out of curiosity, not an attempt to understand the paper better! 

I think the answer is "sort of". A mathematical way to think about the "Kraus" operator is as follows. Set C = B(H) (with H finite-dimensional if you wish). Then, assuming the sum in the Kraus operator is finite (again, it could be infinite if you wish) then we can define a map $A:H \rightarrow H^n$ by a "column" operator $$A(x) = ( A_i^\dagger(x) )_{i=1}^n\qquad (x\in H).$$ Then your Kraus operator is $$ T(\rho) = \sum_i A_i \rho A_i^\dagger = A^\dagger (\rho\otimes 1) A. $$ Here $\rho\otimes 1$ is the operator on $H^n$ given by applying $\rho$ to each coordinate: the notation is explained by observing that $H^n$ is the Hilbert space tensor product $H\otimes \ell^2_n$. So, if you have another operator $S$ given by $(B_j)_{j=1}^m$ we can form $B(x) = (B_j^\dagger(x))$ and then $$ S(T(\rho)) = B^\dagger(T(\rho)\otimes 1)B = B^\dagger (A^\dagger\otimes 1)(\rho\otimes 1\otimes 1)(A\otimes 1)B = C^\dagger (\rho\otimes 1) C,$$ where $C = (A\otimes 1)B : H\rightarrow H^{nm} = H \otimes \ell^2_n \otimes \ell^2_m$. So, you see why tensors appear. But this is a bit different to what you had... 

Edit: So I think my real mistake was in the claim that "if $H_0$ is separable then we can use a sequence". As Bill Johnson implictly points out, you can always find a net $P_\alpha:H_0\rightarrow H$. Just to correct the argument (though Martins now gives it in more generality)... If $H_0$ has the bounded approximation property, then there is an absolute constant $\lambda>0$ so that for $x_1,\cdots,x_n\in H_0$ there is a finite-rank operator $T:H_0\rightarrow H_0$ with $\|T\|\leq \lambda$ and $\|T(x_i)-x_i\| \leq \epsilon$ for each $i$. In our case, $\iota:H\rightarrow H_0$ is a continuous map with dense range. For $x_1,\cdots,x_n \in H_0$ and $\epsilon>0$ we find a finite-rank $T$ with $\|T\|\leq\lambda$ and $\|T(x_i)-x_i\| \leq \epsilon$ for each $i$. As $T(H_0)$ is finite dimensional and $\iota$ has dense range, we can find a linear map $S: T(H_0) \rightarrow H$ so that that $\|\iota S(x) - x\| \leq \epsilon$ for all $x$ in the unit ball of $T(H_0)$. [Proof: If $M\subseteq H_0$ is finite-dimensional, with linear basis $m_1,\cdots,m_n$, then as all norms are equivalent on $M$, if we can ensure that $\|\iota S(m_i)-m_i\|$ is very small, then $\|\iota S(x)-x\|$ will be small uniformly on the unit ball of $M$. But this follows as $\iota$ has dense range and we can choose each $S(m_i)$ completely freely.] Then $\| \iota ST(x_i) - x_i\| \leq \| \iota ST(x_i) - T(x_i) \| + \| T(x_i) - x_i \| \leq \epsilon \|T(x_i)\| + \epsilon$ $\leq \epsilon^2 + \epsilon\|x_i\| + \epsilon$. So $ST : H_0 \rightarrow H$ approximates the identity in the $H_0$ norm. 

Let $A\subseteq B(H)$ be a subset, and let $\text{alg}(A)$ be the algebra generated by $A$. Then it's easy to see that $$A' = \text{alg}(A)'.$$ A similarly easy check shows that if $A$ and $B$ are subsets, then $$A' \cap B' = (A\cup B)' = \text{alg}(A\cup B)'.$$ So, for your question, pick some normal representation $M\subseteq B(H)$ (so that $M''=M$), and let $A\subseteq M$ be a subset. Set $$X=\{x\in M:ax=xa \ (a\in A)\} = A'\cap M = A'\cap M'' = (A\cup M')',$$ so your relative commmutatant is So, yes, this is a von Neumann algebra. In fact, as $A\subseteq M$, clearly $M'\subseteq A'$ and so $A''\cap M = (A'\cup M')' = A''$. So as $X\subseteq A'$, thus $A''\subseteq X'\cap M$. Edit: There is probably an easier example than this... But, let $M=VN(\mathbb F_2)$, say with canonical generators $a$ and $b$. Let $A$ be a star-algebra generated by $b$ and $a^{-1}ba$: so $A$ is just linear combinations of $b^n$ and $a^{-1}b^na$ for $n\in\mathbb Z$. A bit of combinatorics shows that $X=\mathbb C1$ and so the the relative bicommutant is all of $M$. However, $A$ is not ultraweakly dense in $M$, because we cannot approximate the generator $a$. Conclude: So, if I haven't messed up, this shows that the relative bicommutant is always a W*-subalgebra of $M$, but that it might be larger than the ultraweak closure of $A$ in $M$. 

E.g. if E is a Hilbert space this can be extracted from Stone's Theorem and some spectral theory. What I want to know is if there is a way to prove this using the more abstract framework I have setup (which is more accessible if, e.g. we start considering dual spaces and weakly-continuous groups etc.) 

Inspired by Victor's idea: Setup: Let $\theta:G\rightarrow H$ be a continuous dense range map between locally compact (Hausdorff) spaces. Let $G'=\theta(G)$ with the subspace topology from H. Let $\pi:C^b(H) \rightarrow C^b(G)$ be the pull-back of $\theta$. Lemma: The collection of sets of the form $f^{-1}((1/2,\infty))$, where $f$ is a continuous map $G\rightarrow [0,1]$ vanishing at infinity, is a base for the topology on $G$. Proof: Let $G_\infty$ be the one-point compactification, let $s\in G$, and let $U\subseteq G$ be open with compact closure (which is okay, as $G$ is locally compact) with $s\in U$. By Urysohn, there exists a continuous $f:G_\infty\rightarrow [0,1]$ with $f(s)=1$ and $f|_{G_\infty\setminus U} \equiv 0$. Then $f|_G$ vanishes at infinity, and $s\in f^{-1}((1/2,\infty)) \subseteq U$. Clearly every open set can now be written as a union of these special open sets. QED. Claim: Suppose that $\pi$ is surjective (so $\pi$ is infact a bijection). Let $\phi:G\rightarrow G'$ be $\theta$, considered as having codomain $G'$. Then $\phi$ is a homeomorphism, and so $\theta(G)$ is open in $H$. Proof: We show that $\phi$ is open. Let $f\in C^b_{\mathbb R}(G)$, and let $g=\pi^{-1}(f)\in C^b(H)$, so that $g(\theta(s)) = f(s)$ for $s\in G$. Let $U=f^{-1}((1/2,\infty))$ so $\theta(U) = \{ t\in H : \exists s, \phi(s)=t, f(s)>1/2 \}$ $= \{ t\in G' : f(\phi^{-1}(s))>1/2\}$ $= \{ t\in G' : g(t)>1/2 \} $ $= G' \cap g^{-1}((1/2,\infty))$. Thus $\phi(U)$ is open, as $G'$ has the subspace topology. By the lemma, this does show that $\phi$ is open. Then $G'$ is itself locally compact, and so as $G'$ is dense, it must be open in $H$. QED. Claim: If additionally $G$ and $H$ are groups and $\theta$ a homomorphism, then $\theta$ is a surjection. Proof: An open subgroup is closed. QED. If this is all correct, then I'd be a little surprised if this wasn't known (say, the stuff not about groups). Any ideas??? 

Let $E,F$ be Banach spaces and consider the projective tensor product $E \widehat\otimes F$. If $\tau \in E \widehat\otimes F$ with $\|\tau\|<1$ then by definition we can find $(x_n)\subseteq E$ and $(y_n)\subseteq F_n$ with $$ \tau = \sum_n x_n \otimes y_n \qquad \sum_n \|x_n\| \|y_n\| < 1. $$ Now suppose $T,S$ are (bounded) operators on $E, F$ respectively, so that $T\otimes S$ acts on $E \widehat\otimes F$. Suppose $\|(T\otimes S)\tau\| < 1$ as well as $\|\tau\|<1$. Can we find a representation $\tau=\sum_n x_n\otimes y_n$ with both $$\sum_n \|x_n\| \|y_n\| < 1 \qquad \sum_n \|T(x_n)\| \|S(y_n)\| < 1? $$ Motivation: I am mostly interested in the case when $E=F$ is a Hilbert space, and $T=S^{-1}$ is a positive (perhaps unbounded) operator. This is motivated by looking at automorphism groups of C$^*$-algebras.
