This type of dry fly floatant powder is quite effective at drying off smaller flies. I believe it's the same silica gel that is used to keep packaged electronics dry. But I typically just press flies between folds of a cotton t-shirt briefly. This will draw most of the water out and restore "floatability" to the fly. It should also leave it dry enough to put back into storage. 

To gather nesting material - small twigs or fluffy seeds As a nesting location - good cover or protected location To eat insects that are attracted to the plants - flowering plants will be covered in insects which myriad birds eat - even when they are commonly known as seed eaters birds will look for the protein in insects. Heck, insects are a huge part of even a hummingbird's diet. To eat the seeds. This might feel like little more like putting out a feeder (which is undesirable), but in this case there won't be the massive quantities being dumped out at once. The plants will ripen their seeds over time and they may be of no interest to many rodents anyway. 

Unless you're talking way above treeline, you can get some idea by what the vegetation looks like at the top or how far the peak seems to be above the treeline. This works reasonably well in the White Mountains of NH where treeline is about 5000 feet and the tallest mountains a bit over 6000 feet. Below 4000 feet, this method isn't much good because you can't see the differences between a 4000 foot and a 2000 foot forest from a distance. 

And here is a picture showing the long tongue the moth has evolved to reach the nectar. Hummingbirds do it with a long beak, and then a tongue that extends even further, but these moths do strictly with a very long tongue that is curled up in the mouth when not feeding. 

That is cause by clearcut timber harvesting. Timber harvesters will remove branches from trees that they fell and leave them on site. They will also sometimes leave specimen trees to help repopulate the area - or leave undesirable individual trees or species. The standing trees might also be the result of a weak implementation of a clearcut with reserve. 

Take it to a knife smith. They have specialized equipment, experience, and knowledge. They'll be able to put an appropriate grind back on it and address any other issues. 

From what I understand, the floatation characteristics should be relatively similar since both types of hair contain "chambers" that keep in air and provide floatation. An important difference is how they behave when tied. Deer hair will flare more when wrapped, while the elk hair will tend to remain straighter under the same wrapping conditions. I found this article from MidCurrent to be pretty informative. 

I found the best answer is tight underwear made from a slippery fabric with legs that extend just far enough down to cover where things rub in the crotch area. I currently have a pair of Underarmor brand that work very well. They are made of a stretchy but slick synthetic fabric. The garment stays in place on the skin. That means the skin doesn't get rubbed and the garment takes the abrasion instead. The only downside I've noticed is that since these things are kind of slippery, I have to make sure I tighten the belt of the outer pants properly else they tend to fall down more than with regular cotton underwear. That only applies to long pants, like jeans. Shorts are apparently light enough so that this doesn't matter. You might think that this kind of underwear would be hotter, but that turns out not to be the case. I guess because it's always right up against the skin it doesn't trap any air, and the fabric itself is so thin as to not have appreciable thermal resistance. 

Here's a decent video detailing just how to do it: Basically filet it like any other fish. Remove the "dark meat" that is pungent and distasteful. Then remove the row of spines. Taste tests described in the video show that virtually everyone preferred asian carp (poached or fried) over the other varieties such as tilapia. Here's another one narrated with a great accent. 

Rough spots will not shoot through guides as smoothly as unblemished line. This will have a negative impact on the distance you can cast. A rough line will experience more turbulence moving through the air. This will also have a negative effect on the distance, and possibly on accuracy of your cast. If the coating of a floating line gets damaged enough, it can permit water to soak the braided core. This can cause the floating line to sink - or at least not float as well. Aside from the obvious fact that it will no longer be floating, the line will also be more difficult to pick up off the water to cast. 

I would avoid swimming across if possible. For fording the stream, find a wide and shallow section. If you have a group of people, interlock arms and walk across together with the line of the group being parallel to the stream. This gives each person stability up/down stream, which is the direction you are more likely to fall due to the push of the water. To cross alone, use a long pole that you can stick into the ground downstream from you. You and the pole become a triangle such that you can lean on the pole to offset the downstream push of the water. Move only one of your feet or the pole at one time. That all said, sometimes you can't cross. Many years ago, I was on the North Cascades and had gotten dropped off at a trailhead. The plan was to hike over a mountain range and back to camp on the other side, something like 10-12 miles if I remember right. There was a sign near the trailhead saying that the "Panther Creek bridge was out". It was a nice summer day, so I figured I'll just get a bit wet. When I got to Panther Creek, I found it was a lot more than what we call a "creek" around here. It was a swift flowing small river, probably 5 feet deep or so in the middle and maybe 50 feet across. I tried to ford it, but it got too dangerous, and I could see once I got swept off my feet I'd be carried quite a ways downstream before I could eventually make it to one bank or the other and grab hold of something. It was a long walk back to camp along the road. As a side note, on the long hike back to camp along the road, there were several scenic turnouts. At one such turnout a crowd of people had gathered around a car. When I got closer, I could see they were all listening to the radio in that car, which had been turned up loudly for the purpose. I got there just in time to hear the voice of Richard Nixon say "is abhorrent to every instinct in my body". Yes, it was late afternoon (in Washington state) on 8 August 1974. 

Of course this also necessitates the implementation of the whole Sprit rig, but it might be just what you need. 

I would hesitate to do so. The keen wading sandals I've worn let in a fair amount of gravel. This gravel, when caught between the sandal and the neoprene bootie, will make mincemeat of the bootie - causing it to leak. Gravel is a concern even when using full-on wading boots. To combat this many waders have gaiters built in. Mine do not, but I purchased neoprene gaiters to help keep gravel out. That said, I have use an old pair of high-tops over my neoprene booties - with the gaiter. Works just fine as long as the traction is up to the job. 

There are lots more possibilities. Get a map and look. However, one thing you probably don't want to do is Franconia Ridge. There are some pretty waterfalls on the Falling Waters trail, but there are no good places to camp on top. Either it's above tree line or within a exclusion zone, pretty much all the way from Liberty to Garfield. This is also the most crowded backcountry area in the White Mountains because of the number of trails providing access from Franconia Notch, and the presence of Greenleaf Hut. If you're looking for a ambitious but certainly doable day hike, then this works better. One possibility is up Falling Waters, north along the ridge over Lincoln, to LaFayette, down to the hut, and back to the same parking lot via the Bridle Path. You get great views for quite a ways along Franconia Ridge, which is above treeline from Haystack to just above the hut on this route. If you do this, bring winter clothes in your pack. You won't need crampons in the summer, but a good rain/wind shell, wind pants, extra wool sweater to put under the rain shell, goggles, and gloves is NOT overdoing it. The weather can change there very quickly on short notice. I've started out in shorts and a T shirt from Liberty Springs in the morning, and was wearing full winter gear except for crampons by the time I got to LaFayette. At that time 20 mile/hour sleet was blowing in my face, and I was very glad to have goggles on. This was in August. Yes, it can do that, and you can't see it coming due to Kinsman Ridge on the other side of Franconia Notch.
