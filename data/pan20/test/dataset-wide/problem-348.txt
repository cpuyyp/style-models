Event Horizon Nothing lasts forever, including black holes, but they are zero maintenance and they are indestructible. We at Event Horizon TrapsÂ® guarantee they might get in, but they ain't getting out ! Your money back if we're wrong. So ("any level of technology") we can say a Kardashev level 2 culture might be able to construct custom black holes or more complex event horizon based "structures" which cannot be unlocked and can exist for arbitrarily long time frames. Even when they decay by Hawking radiation (which we'll assume exists), nothing is left behind (including nothing nearby as the end stages of evaporation will be an explosion !). 

If you want to stick with science, then first you need to correct a misconception or two. You seem to be thinking of heat or temperature as an intrinsic property of a material, but it's not. Whatever the apparent temperature you measure by e.g. touch, then that's the temperature. A material can have temperature gradients in it : one part hotter or colder than the rest, for example. But it can't appear to be one temperature and actually be another. What a material can have is low thermal conductivity. That means it can act as a buffer to the flow of heat. Heat will only transfer slowly within the material. But it will eventually transfer. An example would be the tiles used on the space shuttle. It's not quite as simple as a low thermal conductivity, but these tiles were designed to "soak up" heat and release it slowly. The aerogels mentioned in another answer ( by @akaioi ) are another example of a material designed to have low thermal conductivity. But it's low, and heat does flow. Also note that the thermal conductivity is temperature dependent. As the material heats up, it's thermal conductivity can increase (and of course it can suffer other structural issues). 

We already give out lots of involuntary signals about our emotions. Very few people can control them. It might make it easier to tell, but then would the changes in skin be consistent between different people ? It's only useful if e.g. everyone turns blue. It's actually problematic if the majority are affected in one way and a minority are affected differently. If the effects were not consistent from person to person, then it would simply complicated communication. It could even lead to discrimination or racism of different kinds. Perhaps I'd be discriminated against because I turn green when telling the truth instead of turning green when I'm lying, like the majority. Human biochemistry is complex, so I'd expect exceptions to the norm. I'd expect full body clothing to become popular. I've seen this in pro poker. Many players now try and wear dark glasses, and cover their faces and necks in various ways to minimize clues that people can pick up about whether they're nervous or faking nervousness or whatever. This might become a trend. But let's assume for a moment there are no differences from person to person : everyone is affected the same way consistently. Does that help us ? Probably not. Much of our social norms actually do operate on lying. At the very least the transitional generation that has not learned to "maneuver" in the new scenario would find it very difficult. For example, how do you deal with your boss when your skin says flat out you're angry as hell or lying and the boss and you are both socially adapted to living the lie that we're all on the same side, and egos are at stake ? How many marriages (happy ones) would survive not being able to get away with those little white lies (yes, I think you look great in that. No I don't think you're getting fat. Bald ? - not easy for a generation used to expecting the lie to get used to the truth, I think). And would it reduce crime ? Probably not. Many criminals are lousy liars anyway (ask a police officer), and it's not the lack of knowing they're lying that allows crime to continue, but the lack of evidence. And we'd still need evidence. Looking like you're lying would be no more useful as evidence than a signed confession without evidence. Would it make politics and business honest ? I have a feeling that it would not. There's a lot at stake and I suspect that the people driven to rise to the top would hardly feel a thing when they lie. I suspect you'd not see any reaction from their skin. But even if it did, there's a lot at stake financially and in terms of power and I think we'd see them learn to lie (it's a skill). And if lying gives an advantage, I'm afraid I'm cynical enough to think we'd find ways to allow it to continue being done. We already bend over backwards to reward people for lyings and deception in business : no one ever got a bonus for being an honest CEO and never mind the dividend. There's an old trick about lying : first you tell as much of the truth as you can, and when you lie you lie in the smallest way possible. That way, when you do have to tell a big lie, it's both easier to do and less likely to be considered as a lie. Which brings us to the last issue. Would we accept that someone is lying based on what we see happen their skin ? Lies are often accepted not because they're actually in any way convincing, but because they're what we (the one being lied to) want to believe. How many people have gotten away with "Honey, I didn't have sex with them, you've got to believe me", despite a truckload of evidence against them and a track record of lying ? We believe what we want to believe and we're really good at ignoring things that we want to on some level. We rationalize the irrational. We make excuses for other people. I don't think it would make as much difference as we'd initially think it might. Most likely outcome : we dress differently to enable us to continue lying. 

Short version : B will opt for "Part of A : the Buffer Zone". And sod the UN and everyone else. No one else will do anything. No country would want this annexed strip of land, anymore than you would like to grab a red hot poker by the wrong end. If it's more trouble than it's worth for country B, then it's more trouble than that for any other country. Any political activity by the UN and other super-governmental organizations to try and resolve the situation would consider the civil war regions a priority, not the essentially stable part of country A than B stole (annexed is such a long word for stole, don't you think ?). 

In practical terms this (and many related issues) is why ships would almost always have single species crews, or at most crews populated by closely compatible crews. It simply makes no sense to try and force incompatible crews together long term - it's asking for trouble. 

A technology that could build such a device would presumably build in a fail safe mechanism that would e.g. detect the forced disconnect and try and seal the artery in some way. It seems unlikely you'd design such a device to not be removable (by accident). So I'd expect some bleeding, but no major issue. Note that puncturing the radial artery is quite common for medical procedures.
