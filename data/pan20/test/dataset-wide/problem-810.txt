It's not that the neutrino detectors don't have a chance of detecting a neutrino, but that the neutrinos do not interact with matter (well hardly ever). If there are $6.5\times 10^{10}$ neutrinos per second per $cm^2$ and if the detector has an area of $10^{6} cm^2$, and it detects 1 neutrino per year, then 1 out of $2.05\times 10^{24}$ neutrinos interacts with the detector. $2.05\times 10^{24}$ pass through the detector unnoticed. 

It would sublimate. The frozen mass of water would decrease in size as the water converts from a solid to a gas (without becoming a liquid) and drifts away. 

If we assume the binary pair have equal masses, then by symmetry a star passing through their barycenter at right angles to their rotation plane will not change their symmetry. I did some simple simulations where a star with mass 0.1 flies through a binary in an originally circular orbit. The first case is with an interloper moving at speed 20. It passes through, losing a bit of momentum to the binary, that now moves slowly in the same direction. 

There is no problem with orbiting a star that moves very fast. Remember that space is mostly empty, so there is nothing like air resistance or friction that would tend to deform the orbit. Stars that become hypervelocity stars likely tend to lose their Oort clouds. They gain their velocity by passing very close to a massive body and getting a velocity increment, for example by having a secondary star or planet ripped away by tidal forces. That already doesn't bode well for the stability of any Oort cloud. Simulations show that planets tend to be ejected from hypervelocity systems unless they are very tightly bound, since they have lower mass and respond more strongly to the velocity changes. This suggests that the lightly bound and small bodies in the Oort cloud will be scattered - likely at even higher velocities. 

On the Near Earth Object Program web page from NASA, it lists about 80 objects that passes near the Earth over the next 4 months. Many of them pass within 0.01 AU, the closest one will pass on Oct 24 and be only 0.0038 AU (or 1.5 times the Earth Moon distance) away. From Wikipedia: 

Voyager is traveling at 17 km/s with respect to the sun. Since the sun is orbiting the galaxy, it is likely that Voyager will also orbit the galaxy for 5 billion years or so, until the collision with Andromeda happens. 

Black holes can orbit each other (we know this from the gravitational waves from their eventual mergers) and there is no particular reason against a small black hole passing through the ergosphere of a large black hole. The main problem is avoiding a merger. The the two-black hole spacetime has no analytic solution and numeric simulations are messy, but a merger will definitely happen if the event horizons overlap. In any case, a rotating black hole has an ergosphere with an equatorial radius of $2GM/c^2$ and event horizon somewhere between this and the limiting radius $GM/c^2$. If we use the extremal case, then we can presumably just barely fit in nearly an identical mass and rotation black hole in the ergosphere. More likely a much smaller black hole could fit in. The direction of rotation would matter for the dynamics, since counter-rotating black holes would tend to coalesce (see this page for a plot of the relevant radii and where the innermost stable circular orbits are). A single black hole passing through the ergoregion would not be able to perform the Penrose process, but we can imagine a binary black hole pair that is ripped apart by tidal forces and then presumably the remaining hole would be ejected with a lot of energy. So, yes, we could get fast small black holes this way. In practice this system would lose a lot of energy through gravitational waves, making it likely that the holes would coalesce anyway. The exact limits require numerical relativity simulations to estimate, and this one would be a tough one. (Note that the gravitational waves also carry away energy, up to 1/8 of the total mass of two equal-sized holes merging, but this energy is very hard to capture. Penrose did note in his classic paper that Misner was first in proposing black hole mining using a variant of this.) 

The moon orbits the Earth in roughly 29 days. So in 14 days, it would be on the other side of the Earth. 

Our sun will eventually become a white dwarf. A star 10 times it mass will become a neutron star. A star 100 times the mass of the sun will become a black hole. So if 100 stars came together into one mass, it would collapse into a black hole. It is currently believed that a super massive black hole (at least 1000 times the mass of our sun) is at the center of our galaxy and also in the Andromeda galaxy. This is where all the iron might be found from this region of space. 

The last humans in this scenario likely die of starvation and/or drought during a natural short-term climate fluctuation. The basic issue is that as the sun heats up there will be a gradual reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (due to plant life but also silicate weathering, which speeds up in warm environments). There may also be a reduction in volcanic outgassing, although I think the timeframe is too slow. This is bad for plants, since they will get less CO$_2$ to photosynthesise from, and it will reduce the climate stabilising feedback so temperatures will start going up as the sun increases in luminosity. Eventually we get to a runaway greenhouse stage where water vapour alone triggers overheating, but this is possibly long after the biosphere is mostly dead. The most complete model of this I have seen is this paper by Franck, Bounama, & von Bloh. They estimate complex multicellular life to go extinct in 0.8â€“1.2 Gyr. Note that this will happen long before the sun becomes even a subgiant. In any case, if this model is correct we should expect that slowly but surely the future humans would be forced to migrate to cool regions and would be especially limited by the dwindling biomass available. But beside this they will be subject to normal random climate fluctuations that sometimes create decade-long droughts or other misfortunes, and it is likely one of those that actually gets the last individuals. Of course, the scenario assumed makes some very strong assumptions. In order to remain recognisably humans over millions of years these humans would have to engage in deliberate genetic control, otherwise genetic drift will make them mutate into new species. It assumes that nobody does anything about the long-term trend. And so on. 

When the galaxies approach together, gravity will effect the orbits of the stars. Since momentum needs to be conserved, the orbit of most of the stars will be changed radically. The different orbits will hide the spiral arms. Now that I have thought more about it, it is very likely that a few stars will collide, maybe it will take a few billion years. 

It is estimated that the sun's core is about 1/5 of the radius of the sun (from Wikipedia). I know that the density of the plasma increases substantially the near the center, and that the volume of the core is 0.008 times the total volume. $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {4/3\pi (0.2)^3}{4/3\pi (1)^3}$$ $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {(0.008)}{(1)}$$ What is the mass of the core compared to the total mass? 

Brown dwarfs are heavier than Jupiter (jupiter has mass 0.000949 solar masses), although about the same size. Their compositions are fairly similar, with brown dwarfs depleted in deuterium if they are heavy enough (it is burned over a few million years after formation). Adams & Laughlin modelled the collisions of brown dwarfs, mainly to estimate whether two dwarfs could merge to make a star heavier than 0.075 solar masses that would begin hydrogen fusion properly. They found that this could happen, and not too much mass appears lost as they splatter into each other if it is a somewhat glancing collision. Obviously, a near glancing hit might just scatter some of their atmospheres but not stop them. Jupiter would likely behave the same. The result would be a heavier brown dwarf. It would be heated significantly by the energy of the merger, which in turn would make it expand to a larger size until it cooled down. Jupiter would also contribute deuterium so if the dwarf was heavy enough it would further heat up for a while. Given Jupiter's minimal mass compared to the 0.075 limit it is not likely it would be enough to turn the new object into a red dwarf. 

The only light you would see, would be from the stars outside the black hole. Any light that is generated inside the event horizon would be refracted towards the singularity. You wouldn't see the object in front of you since the light would not reach your eye. 

This simulation probably gives the best answer. Added: The simulation is a 2 1/2 min video of the creation of a large galaxy from interstellar dust by collecting smaller galaxies. The time span is probably in hundreds of millions of years. 

I agree that the crater needs to be lined, but you also have the problem of maintaining a satellite in stationary orbit above the crater. Nearly impossible unless the crater is on the equatorial plane. Also, a stationary satellite around the moon would be influenced by the Earth, so you would need to burn fuel to keep the satellite in position.
