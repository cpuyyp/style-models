There is strong evidence to indicate that in some (many?) cases, the cause can be developmental, i.e. a result of various effects while in the womb. To quote from Wikipedia to summarize the theory: 

- Source Garstecki's claim is based of studies on this very topic, many of which he was directly involved in. From Comparing two methods to measure preferred listening levels of personal listening devices 

No other states or countries such as Canada or the UK have mandated a similar warning. What, if any evidence led to California considering 4-methylimidazole used in the manufacture of sodas to have a risk of causing cancer? The AP news story mentions studies done on rats, although I can't find anything on Google Scholar. 

This belief seemed to spread in April 2011 via twitter. Due to Ryanair's reputation as being overly greedy at the cost of the consumer, I think many people have simply assumed that this claim was true. It does not appear that it has been looked into too conclusively, but the investigations that have been done indicate that the claim is not true. Popular travel blog tnooz investigated this, which has an unsourced quote from a Ryanair official denouncing the claim as untrue. tnooz refers to a company called Invisible Hand which make a browser addon of the same name which helps to find the lowest flights on airline websites. Invisble Hand tested this claim by running 52 flight searches in Firefox and Chrome over 2 days, with cookies being consistently cleaned from Chrome but not from Firefox. The conclusion they reached was: 

The hooks don't penetrate very deeply into the skin, although will dig deeper if attempting to forcibly remove the device. Given that the device is latex, the device could be cut into sections, which would allow sections to be removed, reducing overall pressure which would otherwise force other hooks in more deeply. Assistance would still be needed to remove the device, although given that the device does not penetrate below skin level I would not think a surgeon is specifically required. The claim about needing a surgeon and potential permanent damage seems like advertising and nothing more. It seems likely that the device could be removed without a surgeon or even by someone without a lot of medical training. In the worst case scenario, the device can probably be forcibly removed without permanent damage. The website gives no reference to explain how permanent damage could come about and given how the device works it seems unlikely. Given a few weeks/months of healing or years of jailtime, removing the device forcibly is probably going to be a pretty common approach. It should be noted that the device has attracted a lot of criticism: 

You mention VOC being more of an office building problem, but that's actually not at all true. There are PLENTY of sources for VOCs in a home - again, you just don't think of them as a 'source' of VOCs. Bernstein, 2008 includes a nifty table of sources for VOC indoor air pollution: 

For other produce which might be treated with an insoluble chemical compound, you can try using a vinegar wash. This study on potatoes indicates that washing removes most compounds, as does peeling and food cooking/preparation. Carbofuran is no longer permitted to be used on fruits in the US, nor be present on fruits imported to the US. It is also not permitted in the EU. Of course, there is a very simple manner in which you can guarantee no pesticide/fungicide/preservative contamination of your food: buy organic. Whenever I make cakes or pies which require lemon, lime or orange zest, I buy organic. Then I don't have to worry. So, given the short half-lives of these compounds on the fruits, it would be difficult (albeit not entirely impossible if someone ate 10 crates of orange zest) to be poisoned by the residue left on the zest. The same follows for any wax compound: it's a matter of the amount sprayed (which is regulated differently by country) and the amount of time it's left on the fruit. Some waxes (beeswax) are natural products. Edited to add: The following waxes are commonly used in citrus handling: 

Without getting into the blatant commercialism on the site, I'll concentrate on the 'detoxification' recommendation of: Coffee Enemas. These are most often touted as being either detoxifying (as in the Gerson Therapy), a preventative for cancer or a treatment for cancer. There is no evidence that coffee enemas are beneficial. Ernst, E. M.D., Ph.d., F.R.C.P. (Edin). Colonic Irrigation and the Theory of Autointoxication: A Triumph of Ignorance over Science. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology. 24(4):196-198, June 1997.

I have to go pick up my son from daycare, but I'll discuss the ozone portion shortly. ...shortly is about a week later! Sorry guys! Life intruded. Nothing on the Gerson page specifically mentions ozone therapy, at least not that I've seen. Anyone suggesting you inhale ozone is, quite simply, an idiot. They're also putting your health at risk. Ozone is a pollutant in the atmosphere. (It's vital in the stratosphere, but tropospheric and atmospheric O3 is a pollutant and detrimental to human health.) Ozone exposure has been long known to exacerbate asthma. See McConnell, et al Asthma in exercising children exposed to ozone: a cohort study Ozone in your indoor air will also react with any VVOC, VOC or SVOC - very volatile organic compound (formaldehyde, methanol, methane), volatile organic compound (benzene, limonene), or semi volatile organic compound (PAHs) - the same as it does when it creates photochemical smog outdoors. 

So, there is evidence that re-heating cooking oils can have a negative health impact. It is unclear to what extent the impact would be on humans at this stage. Given that the study experiments continuously heated the oil for an extended period, re-using cooking oil once or twice is probably OK. 

Personally I would not say that most tourists consider themselves more sophisticated in travel ability. In my experience that attitude seems restricted to people backpacking or taking extended (months to years) long trips, while most tourists tend to take very short trips: 

Since academia didn't exist at the onset of human culture, we can reduce the definition to "a calling requiring specialized knowledge". Even allowing for prostitution requiring specialized knowledge it would seem that hunting or perhaps farming is the worlds oldest profession. The earliest evidence for prostitution we have under any definition is 18th Century BC, according to Wikipedia (expanded on in Sklivvz's answer). By contrast, humans were hunting using specialized knowledge starting from some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago. To quote from Wikipedia:

The only evidence for the claim that the device must be removed by a medical professional comes from the device creator, on the website of the product. It seems like an important point, since the idea is that in having to have such a device removed the authorities would be alerted and the rapist caught. Testing how hard the device is to remove isn't something that has had a lot of time dedicated to it yet, perhaps in no small part due to a lack of volunteer test subjects. As to whether or not the device needs to be removed by a medical professional? Quoting from the Rape Axe FAQ: 

There are many examples of people claiming they need their morning cup of coffee in order to be able to function at their normal level: NIC blog: 

No. There is no evidence to suggest that water does have a memory, at least not anywhere near the length of time proponents of homeopathy claim that it does. The study by Ennis was interesting only because it was published in Nature. A main problem with both Ennis' and Benveniste's studies is that their starting premise is that water does have a memory. Not to mention the unfounded conclusions they draw from their observations. The results have so far been unable to be replicated. It would seem likely that if water did have a memory such a thing would be easily testable and reproducible. The BBC took a team of which James Randi was a member and tried to replicate the results reported by Ennis. They failed. Quoting from the transcript: 

Any coating with carnauba wax will not rinse off in water, nor will it wash off with vinegar. It is soluble in ether, but that's not a big help. Any coating with shellac will not rinse off in water. You will need to use an baking soda (alkaline compound) to remove it. The polyethylene emulsion will depend on the particular compound used. 

Yes, there are studies which show a correlation between methylmercury exposure and attention deficits. One of the 'cornerstone' mercury studies was performed in the Faroe Islands by Grandjean, et al 1999, (Methylmercury exposure biomarkers as indicators of neurotoxicity in children aged 7 years ) where they followed a cohort of 917 Faroese children from birth until the age of 7, which reported 

So yes, that lovely smell you smell in your new car is a bunch of chemicals you really don't want to be smelling. And, if you live where it's warm - you'll smell more of them. 

Is formaldehyde the sole source of the 'new car smell'? No. It's more than likely the combined smell of the VOC's (of which formaldehyde is one) emitting from the interior, as there's over a dozen VOC's which are present. Brown, Stephen K and Min Cheng, 2007. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in New Car Interiors They found that the amount of VOCs present is dependent upon the 'delivery time' of the car from the manufacturer. Those cars which didn't have a 'shelf life' at a dealership had the highest amounts of VOCs present. Those which had been on display outside had the lowest. The chemicals they recorded were: 

Your question seems to focus on food allergies, which isn't the whole allergy picture. Chemical allergies are indeed on the rise, as fragrance materials (of which there are over 6000 different types) are loaded into everything from our soaps to our cleaning agents. Food allergies are tricky things; I myself am allergic to mushrooms. You've never quite enjoyed life until you've been intubated while conscious, let me tell you. But there does appear to be a increasing trend in both the UK and the US of peanut allergies. EDIT to add: Studies suggest an increase in anaphylaxis, and from a study Burks describes the increase as follows: 

The act of shedding leaves is a response to an environmental pressure (dehydration). In the northern hemisphere trees 'recall' the nitrogen and carbon present in their leaves in the fall in preparation for winter, to prevent dehydration of the tree during the dry period(s). For your case in India, the 'dry season' is between March-May, and as a result the trees recall their C/N at that point.
