Here's a simplified answer. "About" the farthest thing we can see with the naked eye is the Andromeda galaxy at about 2 million light years. Therefore, I would say that you just have to be in a void with no galaxies closer than about 2 or 3 million light years. I could be wrong, but I'm thinking that this is most of the known universe. As far as future Earth goes, it won't be about distance, but about when the last star close enough to see "burns out, which will be a VERY long time from now. There may not even be an Earth then, if it is engulfed by the sun going red giant. 

Delta Pavonis has about the same mass as the sun so I would think that the evolutionary path would be about the same (the mass is given as O.991 M(Sun)/ not sure how we get this so accurately). It has been estimated to be about 6.6 to 6.9 Ga with a luminosity of 1.22 L(Sun). This all makes sense if you put it on the main sequence where we will be in a couple of billion years (after T(max) in about a billion years). The problem is that the surface temperature is only 5550K (spectral) and for this reason is thought to be in subgiant phase which isn't supposed to happen to us for about another 5.5 billion years. Delta Pav also has a very high metallicity [Fe/H] of +0.33 which also screams "subgiant". What am I missing?? (data from Wikipedia sources) 

It depends on the composition of the atmosphere. In a helium (or other light gas) atmosphere, your voice would have a higher pitch. If the gasses are heavier, your voice drops. The density is also a factor: on Mars, sounds can't be as loud as on Earth. Sound is transmitted as pressure differences, and the largest pressure difference you can get is that between the atmospheric pressure and a vacuum. The speed of sound also changes with the composition and pressure of the atmosphere. This would change the way you perceive the distance and direction of an object that makes a sound: we normally use the tiny differences in time between a sound reaching our left ear and our right ear. A different speed of sound screws up those time differences. 

For a lot of my uninformed life, I have doubted the existence of gravitons or even that gravity is an actual "force" (like electromagnetism). This is because my vision of general relativity was that mass curves space such that objects are still traveling in a "straight line" when being acted upon by "gravity", so that no "force" is needed. I know now that this is a naive view, but I'm not 100% sure why. I was thinking the other day that just the fact that gravity follows an inverse square law implies that it is a force carried by particles (falling off in flux intensity due to the geometry of 3D space). My question would be: Does the fact that gravity follows an inverse square law naturally fall out of general relativity equations or is it an assumption used when developing the equations? And, just now, I had the thought that other forces may curve space also (just in higher dimensions). 

No, "dark fluid" is not a synonym for dark matter. The Daily Mail article derives from a press release by the EPFL and an article in Science magazine, neither of which mention the word 'fluid'. We don't know what dark matter is yet. There are several theories. One of them compares dark matter to a fluid: 

The second critical parameter is the beam width. Beam width depends highly on frequency: beamwidth = wave length/dish diameter When you use several dishes in an interferometer, you can increase their effective accuracy and decrease their collective beam width. A bit more info on the mechanics of the Lovell telescope: 

OSIRIS-Rex has been spotted on its approach to Earth, at a distance of approximately 7 million miles (12 million kilometers) away, with a brightness of approximately 25th magnitude. The Large Binocular Telescope was used for this observation, this has a pair of 8.4-meter mirrors. 

This is almost identical to an unanswered question already asked, but I want to put it a different way. The announced LIGO event was from a localized source. I assume that gravitational waves from the Big Bang would come from "everywhere" like the CMB, so I don't see how LIGO or the next generation observatory (ie. eLISA) would detect this. One thing else I would like to know, if anyone is aware: I watched an hour long webcast on You Tube and the question I had during the whole time was asked just as the webcast went "off the air". My question is that, since this announcement is about five months after the detection and since it happened "right away", has anything else been detected over the last five months? (Has LIGO been continuously observing? I know that the upgrade is still in progress and sensitivity should get about three times better.) 

The easiest way is to look it up, e.g. here: $URL$ Because the moons' positions change, and they are too small to distinguish in a small telescope, there are no general rules. 

Some of those "far more difficult feats" (like detecting planets that orbit other stars) are done by "cheating": we (mostly) can't see those planets directly, but we can detect their presence by the effect it has on the light of its star. That's a technique we can't use for objects in the outer solar system. Here's another visualization, one that shows the rapid progress we've made in how much of the solar system we can detect. In 1980, we had identified about 8000 asteroids. By 2010, we'd found half a million. The red area in the graph above is shrinking steadily. Asteroid visualization 

Science fiction seems to depict the experience of traveling through wormholes (if possible of course) as seeing psychedelic colors or lines of light where stars once were (ie. 2001 or Contact). I wonder if theorists have any idea of what, if anything, the traveler would see. This question may be subjective, but I know that there are theories about what an observer would see if traveling near the speed of light. 

I know that models of ocean planets typically have deep liquid water that transitions into exotic forms of ice. What I am wondering is if it makes sense to have an "ocean floor" composed of debris from bombarding asteroids during the early formation stages? 

I think you're like me and need more of a layman's answer. If you want a good, easy to understand explanation of what happens look at "Formation and Evolution of the Solar System" in Wikipedia then click on 5.3 (The Sun and planetary environments). The sun will actually expand twice: Once when the core gets so hot from accelerated hydrogen fusion (as the sun's core gets hotter the hydrogen burns faster) that the hydrogen in the shell around the core starts to fuse (this hydrogen fusion in the shell is what pushes the outer layers out to about 1AU). Then after as long as about 2 billion years. The core reaches a critical density/temperature (due to the increased amount of helium) that the helium starts to fuse into carbon. At this point, there is a helium "flash" and the sun shrinks back down to about 11 times its original size. The helium in the core fuses into carbon for about 100 million years until the same sort of thing happens (except this time hydrogen and helium in the shell around the core start to fuse causing outer layers to expand again. It's after the helium starts getting used up (or "polluted" with carbon enough to stop the fusion process) and there is not enough mass to start carbon fusion that a planetary nebula is ejected and the star starts to "die". 

(emphasis mine). So they're not saying dark matter is exactly like a fluid, they're saying dark matter has some properties that are comparable to the behavior of fluids. 

Answer based on a misunderstanding of the question, left here because it contains some useful background on WISE. The pie-shaped patterns starting in 2010 are results of the WISE mission (see the video description). The radial pattern within those pie shapes is not explained by my answer. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a space telescope launched in 2009 to map the entire sky in infrared wavelengths. 

you can see the telescope is perpendicular to the solar panels, so it'll tend to look at objects perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, which causes the bright bands you see in the video. $URL$ 

I used to think that most terrestrial planet atmospheres were secondary (from out gassing). However, after reading this $URL$ and noticing that the ratio of CO2 to N2 is far higher on Venus than that just expected from out gassing, I have done a 180. I'm thinking that Earth has a primarily secondary atmosphere because of the Moon creating event and smaller planets like Mars just aren't massive enough to retain original nitrogen, etc. Would this cast a shadow on the idea of early extreme stellar activity ripping off atmospheres of close in planets? 

I have just been watching a podcast called "Deep Astronomy" and the discussion was about a super fast spinning black hole discovered with the NuSTAR space observatory. This black hole was modeled with high confidence to be spinning at about 99% of the maximum spin rate. They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is "c" (and how can a singularity have a "tangential velocity"?) They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a "naked black hole" that would defy the laws of physics (GR). Also, shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down. Could somebody clarify this whole "black hole spin thing" without getting too complicated?? 

As the other answers have said, it's a matter of distance. Not just directly (large distance = small gravitational effect), but also because large distance = long orbital period. If Planet 9's orbit is 10,000 years long, it has moved across a very small portion of its orbit over the past 100 years, so the force vector of its gravitational attraction has moved across a very small angle. That alone makes the wobble much harder to detect than the wobble caused by e.g. Mercury with its 3-month orbital period. Here's a graph that illustrates which objects we can see with current technology, and which are below the limits of current technology. 

So, servo motors and presumably, calibration are what enables this accuracy. The Lovell telescope has 2 elevation drive motors with gearboxes on each side of the dish. These can be driven so that one motor pulls the dish, and the dish drags along the second motor. This eliminates gear backlash in the system: the two gear trains are "wound up" in opposite directions. This means they can make adjustments without gear backlash interfering.

Looking at this article: $URL$ , from an answer in stack exchange by userLTK, there appears to be at least two kinds of "Manx" (tailless) comets. One would be a rocky body that was ejected into a high eccentricity orbit during the formation of the inner planets. Another would be an ice-rock object diverted from the Oort Cloud that has lost most of its ice during close approaches to the sun (a "dead" comet). I wonder how we could tell the difference. 

I'll be honest. I looked up Galactic Habitable Zone on Wikipedia. The idea was introduced in 1986 and expanded upon in the book "Rare Earth" by Brownlee and Ward. Essentially the idea is that in the bulge there is too much activity (supernovae, etc.) and in the halo of the galaxy there is not enough heavy elements (carbon, etc.) for life to exist. This was in reference to complex life "as we know it" (Check out another Peter Ward book entitled "Life As We Do Not Know It"). Stellar habitable zones are based on the presence of liquid water. This definition would greatly increase the theoretical "Galactic Habitable Zone". I think we need to look at a region and calculate all of the pluses and minuses of that specific region then keep our minds open.
