In the words of the Rolling Stones: Paint It Back. You may need to experiment to find something durable but it should be quite easy to find something suitable. 

The cage length is what determines the rear dérailleur’s total capacity. The total capacity equates to how much slack chain the dérailleur can handle. Sheldon calculates it as 

As darkcanuck mentions, make sure you check the chain for wear and when it gets outside of acceptable limits change it. If you don't then you'll end up having to change other components too. I left mine too long (much, much too long) and ended up having to buy a new cassette and chainrings. The rest of the drivetrain may survive for years but only if you look after the chain properly and and replace it when necessary. 

I have one of these: $URL$ (for some reason that site insists I look at in Mobile view on my phone, it won't let me view the full site, I'll fix the link later when I'm on my computer) With a bit of fiddling I can get 3 adult bikes on there. Depending on the bikes I sometimes have to alternate the direction they face and sometimes not. To preserve the paint from scratches you can buy foam pads to insert between the bikes, plus I've found that either wrapping the pedals in old teatowels or removing them completely can make life easier. You should be able to get two bikes on a two bike rack with a bit of manoeuvring (it may be quite straightforward), but if you can afford it a three bike rack might be easier to use and gives you more leeway in the future. I found that for peace of mind I needed to add two extra straps to the bottom of the rack to secure the bottoms of the bikes and stop the whole lot from bouncing away from the car when you hit a bump (this was probably unnecessary but it made me feel better). 

A quick search for "Bike Storage" on Instructables gives me somewhere in the region of a 100 results (not all of them are relevant obviously) which are listed here. You may get further with a different search. Something like the Bike Tree might be what you're looking for: 

Between them the two books tend to give me a thorough step by step breakdown of what needs to be done and what tools I might require, whilst the internet just pads this out (and can occasionally be either difficult to search or confusing with it's results). 

I have a HTC Hero which I charge using one of Ladyada's Minty Boosts (v2), when it gets caught short. This uses 2 AA batteries (which could very well be pre-charged rechargeables) to charge the phone (2 AAs give me between 20% and 30% of a full charge in about 30 minutes). I don't tend to charge using it while I'm riding, as it gets rather hot, and I'm not convinced my soldering is up to the job. On the internet there are various instructions to modify Minty Boosts to run off solar power but on Instructables there's also a modification to run this off a bike dynamo. 

The small jockey wheels on the derailleur can also seize up preventing it from functioning properly, you should if you're lucky be able to remove them and regrease them if needed. 

The indicator is now showing the gear above the one I'm actually in, so if like the picture it shows a 2 I would actually be in 1 (the smallest chainring), a 3 showing means I'm on the middle chainring and no indicator means I'm on the biggest chainring. I've tried searching for tutorials on overhauling the shifter in the hopes that these would include the gear indicator but all of the ones I've found seem to deal only with the actual shifter part of the array and not the indicator. Does anyone know if it is possible to fix the gear indicator? Can you point me towards (or give me a run through) of how to go about fixing it if it's possible to do so? Other than showing the wrong gear everything else about the shifter works fine. 

On my hybrid I have an 11 - 34 cassette on the back giving a difference of 23, and a 48-38-28 set of chainings on the front giving me a difference of 20. This means I need a rear dérailleur with a cage capable of dealing with a total capacity of 43. Sheldon's page about dérailleur selection is here: $URL$ There is also a capacity measurement given with dérailleurs which equates to the largest sprocket size it can cope with in terms of the number of teeth. 

I've just bought a second hand road bike which doesn't have Quick Release Skewers. Can I just buy a set of QR Skewers and fit them? Are they a standard size? Are there any gotchas waiting to bite me if I do change to them? Is there anything specific I need to look for in order to change to QR Skewers? 

In addition to all of the suggestions already, and slightly off-topic, if you're riding your bike in heavy rain and you're on skinny wheels and tyres be very careful when riding through puddles. Even apparently shallow puddles can conceal fairly deep potholes and a buckled wheel or being thrown off your bike into the path of oncoming traffic could put a serious dampener on your enjoyment of the ride or prevent you making it to work completely (if it's a commute). 

There's $URL$ which is linked to 4 magazines: Cycling Plus, Mountain Biking UK, Procycling and What Mountain Bike. As a result it carries various bike and gear reviews from the magazines as well as some which are only online (I think). As all of the magazines are UK based the site obviously has a British bias. 

The main problem with having no rear reflector is that if you are involved in an accident with a car at night and make a claim on the drivers insurance, then the insurers, being insurers, will probably seek to nullify the claim by proving that your bike was not adequately equipped to be on the road at night due to the lack of legally required reflectors. You're also supposed to have amber reflectors on both sides of the pedals too, which doesn't seem feasible on clipless pedals. 

When I'm turning left I put my left arm straight out. When I'm turning right I put my right arm straight out. Then I do the Hokey Cokey.....sorry got a bit carried away there. I vaguely remember from my Cycling Proficiency test that flapping your right arm up and down signals that you're stopping, but in the more than 30 years since I passed it I don't remember ever using it. 

I usually just ring my bell and say excuse me, then once I'm actually passing them I'll usually say thanks. I tend not to tell them which side due to the unpredictableness of the pedestrian and then just play it by ear depending which way they step. 

although I'm fairly sure I didn't pay anywhere near £30 for it. But I have had it for a few years now and it may be a completely inferior model to the one shown. I like it because it acts as a wicking layer and a windproof layer, getting rid of my sweat and stopping the lovely subarctic winds which whistle down from the West Pennine Moors from making it chill next to my skin (and that's in the summer). 

Transport Direct have a route planner which includes cycling routes and has some nice options (especially the choice between quietest, quickest and most recreational route). CycleGM have details of all cycle lanes and traffic free routes through Greater Manchester on their website, but the online map is not very user friendly. 

You might want to check the chains for "stretch" if they've been on the bikes for any length of time as this can cause the cause the chain to skip (as can worn sprockets resulting from running with a worn chain for too long. The easiest way is to get a ruler and measure 12 double links worth of chain. If the chain has "stretched" (in other words worn) it will measure more than 30cm (12 inches) and may also have damaged the sprockets on the rear cassette or chainring too. The degree of wear will indicate whether the chain needs replacing or the sprockets too. Sheldon Brown's site gives the following indicators: 

so it's likely they'll both fit. A search for the Topeak FX Mudguard on Google Shopping gives me various ones at less than £9 as does the Topeak RX Mudguard. This place allterraincycles.co.uk appears to have both the front and rear in stock and will charge you 2 quid less including delivery, than the ebay one you're looking at. 

I assume you've seen this Instructable: $URL$ on this, unfortunately it doesn't talk about waterproofing. You could use some sort of silicon sealant, or rubber sealant. Would a patch from a puncture repair kit and some glue (you might need different glue than with an inner tube) do the trick, if the patch isn't big enough air mattresses usually come with a bigger patch. Alternatively you could look for some sort of tape with which to tape over the washer. 

Disc brakes are definitely the way to go. The first time you pull the brakes in wet weather (and every subsequent time) be prepared for a high pitched squeal reminiscent of an articulated lorry stopping. You'll definitely be able to get pedestrian's to notice you! 

There are products like these: $URL$ which move your earbuds outside of your ear and cut down on wind noise. I remember seeing some specialist earbuds which appeared to be a hollow tube earlier this year, they were supposed to allow you to listen to your music and hear traffic noise but I can't seem to track them down on Google, if you can find them they might also be an option. I wouldn't dream of riding whilst listening to music if I couldn't hear the traffic noise, and as other posters have mentioned it might be useful to hear the noises from your bike too. EDIT: The BBC this morning were carrying a news item where a Road Safety organisation waa calling for a widespread campaign to inform the public of the dangers of walking/cycling whilst wearing earphones (there were two other suggestions for other campaigns too). As they were said to be a contributing factor in a large number of accidents. 

Are the holes on the inner surface of the inner tube as opposed to the outer surface. It could be that one of your spokes is slightly loose, when you sit on the bike this spoke may be pushing into the tube slightly and causing the punctures. Check the position of the holes and see if they're inside or outside, if they're outside then check for sharp objects pushing through the tyre as previously mentioned by someone else. 

Another suggestion I've heard is that you should invest in a leather saddle such as a Brooks, and it will over time mould itself to fit your sit bones. A Brooks B17 was the suggestion (if I recall correctly), as you can get one for about £50. 

If you've tried all of the charities and bike co-ops in your area and are still left with a pile of parts, you could try offering them (free or for a nominal charge) to the bike hackers over on the Atomic Zombie Forums (or somewhere similar). If they're parts then they'll probably be glad of them, if they're frames then they'll probably only take them if they're not aluminium. You can never have too many tools. Alternatively, depending on how much stuff you've got buy an arc welder and build your own trike or recumbent - plans here: Atomic Zombie Extreme Machines 

You could always try making your own. There are lots of different ideas for designs over at Instructables the one below uses the bracket off an old reflector plus a phone holder (ie for mounting your phone on a car dashboard) screwed to it. More details here. I particularly like the rubber bands for extra security. My main worry would be the rain though and the danger of getting the phone wet (but then I do live near Manchester in the UK). 

If you look at the various turbo trainers that are available, they should have some indication of what size of wheel they can accommodate in terms of the diameter. If you've got 26" wheels on your mountain bike, then that's the size the it'll need to be able to cope with. Mine just comes with a special Quick Release skewer to use with the trainer (you swap it back to the normal skewer when you want to use your bike as normal). 

One of the aspects of Cycling Advocacy is to make cycling more popular. My usual approach to this is to get work colleagues to volunteer to take part in a charity bike ride a few months from now (we usually do the Manchester to Blackpool Bike Ride in aid of The Christie which is about 60 miles long). Out of the various people who volunteer and do the bike ride each year, a number carry on cycling (if they hadn't already been keen cyclists), this was what got me back into cycling a few years ago, now. So my suggestion would be to try and get friends or colleagues to do something cycling related with a few months to prepare for it, and hope that as a result they will rediscover cycling and become once more converted to the Way of the Bike. 

If bikesandcode's suggestions aren't enough you could always paint your mudguard reflective like this: $URL$ Like this: 

On my hybrid (think Mountain bike style but with thinner wheels) I average about 12-14 mph around Bolton (lots of hills) when I go out at my in-laws (in Doncaster where it's fairly flat) I average 15-18mph. On a road bike you'll be faster still as it's lighter and built for speed. 

Check inside the rim at the point where the punctures occur. Is the rim tape intact? Does a spoke push through when weight is placed on the bike? One of my friends had a problem like this, and it turned out that when he sat on the bike his weight caused the end of a spoke to push through the rim and puncture his tyre. 

Although it's mostly geared towards chopping up existing (steel) frames and converting the resultant bits into either recumbents, trikes, quads, electric bikes or choppers, there's a fair bit of generally useful info at the Atomic Zombie site and in their forums. The same couple who run the Atomic Zombie site also have a couple of bike building books out: Bike, Scooter, and Chopper Projects for the Evil Genius Atomic Zombie's Bicycle Builder's Bonanza Some other books include: Bicycling Science Bicycle Design: The Search for the Perfect Machine (Richard's Cycle Books) Art of Wheelbuilding 

The equipment you are talking about is called a turbo trainer. In terms of weight loss I'm not sure which is best, spinning (pedalling quickly against low resistance) is good for cardiovascular stuff, whereas grinding along in a high gear or against a higher resistance is going to improve your strength and build muscle. My gut feeling (if you'll excuse the slight pun) is that spinning will help you drop weight, but that's just intuition not knowledge talking.
