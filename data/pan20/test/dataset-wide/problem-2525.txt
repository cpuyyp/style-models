The eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind are impermanent, subject to destruction, vanishing, subject to origination, subject to cessation. Forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tactile sensations, mind objects … Eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness… Eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact as condition, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant … that too is impermanent, subject to destruction, vanishing, subject to origination, subject to cessation. Seeing thus you experience revulsion towards the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, the mind; towards forms, sounds, odors, flavors, tactile sensations, mind objects; towards eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness; towards eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact; towards whatever feeling arises with eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. Experiencing revulsion you become dispassionate. What is impermanent is suffering. What is suffering is nonself. What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, the mind becomes dispassionate and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. Based on SN 35.39-43, 22.45 in Ven Bodhi's translation 

the answer is simple and it was offered in response to similar questions earlier you cannot tell truth, you stay silent maybe a white lie burdens with less black kamma than a malevolent or self-interested lie, but it's still a lie, so i see silence as the best strategy 

to the best of my familiarity with the Canon, outside of clear instructions for laity regarding 3 ways of skillful bodily action 

in my opinion nobody can help animals with regard to their kamma, they're simply to exhaust the kamma which caused their birth as an animal and bounce to the plane their remaining kamma allows them to i'm not sure why pets would differ in this respect from wild animals dhammic concept of kamma is ethical, only ethical intentions produce it, and since animals are incapable of having and committing ethically meaningful intentions and acts, because they don't control their urges and instincts, cannot judge them objectively and restrain or motivate themselves, they don't produce new kamma the concept is not dissimilar to exoneration from liability on the grounds of incompetency that's again my opinion 

Paticcasamuppadavibhanga sutta ( SN 12.2) i think ignorance covers nescience of the phenomenon of suffering and the way of escape from it 

because with a worldling justice is being served from a defiled mind, the intentions can't ever be completely pure and so justice will eventually not be just i think the most Buddhist advice would be to refrain from rendering justice as much as possible, the law of kamma will in due course take care of that anyway 

i think Wikipedia articles on the man and on the Dalit emancipation movement give some insight into his reasons $URL$ $URL$ they appear to be primarily socio-political rather than existential and spiritual 

i entertain three possible explanations of equanimity as brahmavihara: a) impartiality, i.e. directing the other three equally at everyone irrespective of their qualities - mine b) lack of involvement with and attachment to others - Laurence Khantipalo c) watching carefully and ready to act (in helping others) - suggested by some other person 

although to my knowledge this view isn't attested for anywhere, i think this custom has also an aspect of inculcating a sense of moderation, modesty and knowing one's limits in getting free rides the monastics obtain their meals for free as donations, just one meal is a great gift and act of generosity, because lay people aren't obliged to feed monastics expecting to be fed for free trice a day for instance would be impudent of monastics as it would put more strain on the lay community resources 

It is commonly known that the Buddha decided that asceticism does not lead to enlightenment, but less common is the reason why given. From Ajahn Brahm's book Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond, it appears as though the Buddha abandoned asceticism because eating well was necessary to pursue the jhānas and the Middle Way: 

--What the Buddha Taught. What else do people who have realized Nirvāṇa do besides become teachers? Can you cite examples? 

What enters the mind of a Buddha when left idle? Suppose a Buddha were confined to a hospital bed or prison cell. One cannot remain within the conditioned states of jhana indefinitely. If one is unconditionally content, even in states of pain, it would seem there is no need to reflect or contemplate anything. Can you cite specific examples from the Buddha's life? 

Furhermore, Buddhism asserts that the body is constituted by way of material elements, and that a person is made up of the five aggregates. And similarly, a materialist, scientific reductionist understanding posits (quote): 

If there is no self, no "mind" or "I" that can be found, then what does Buddhism call that faculty which exercises personal responsibility? 

I meditate for the purpose described by the Dalai Lama (in his book The Heart of Meditation: Discovering Innermost Awareness): 

Where in MN 36 do we find this reasoning? Is there general agreement in Buddhism that this is indeed why the Buddha decided to give up asceticism? 

The first draft of this question was partly motivated by the question, "is compassion real?", however, from reading One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism (Joseph Goldstein), my understanding is now that compassion is relative (not intrinsically real), i.e. as Joseph Goldstein puts it: 

Here the Buddha makes a clear distinction here between 'development of the body' and 'development of the mind', and from MN 119 

I think we can show that the Noble Truths talk about both craving and attachment. We don't have to read them as craving "instead of" attachment. First note that the Noble Truths (DN 22) describe the origination of stress as particular kind of craving, and this kind is 

What did the Buddha mean by 'development of the body' versus 'development of the mind'? Then, how does one develop the body? 

The world is full of ideas. The ideas themselves do not cause wrong view. The solution is not ignorance. Opening one's mind to them, or education, is the opposite of ignorance. The Mind and Life Institute is a living example of doing so by one of Buddhism's most advanced practitioners - the Dalai Lama. 

Are Buddhist monks allowed to have prescriptions, or would that be considered an attachment? Did the Buddha say anything of medicine? 

from MN 36 Maha-Saccaka Sutta translated by Thanissaro. Pleasant feeling (vedanā) is not limited to five senses, but can also be experienced by the mind. To understand the sutta, it seems important to understand what exactly is meant by development of the body. 

After 30-60 minutes I am calm and aware, but seeing no further benefit in sitting longer. I don't buy the idea that the Buddha's teachings were only available to the select few who can achieve special meditative states. Are there any teachers or traditions that teach a path that does not rely on long meditations that last for hours? (The closest I know of is the Insight Meditation Society, and while they don't appear to emphasize jhanas, they do hold meditation retreats.) 

Differences? It appears Wikipedia tells us that the difference between Buddhist and materialist views on no self lies in karma and rebirth: 

Is it be more accurate to say that the self as a feeling that there is a subject of experience "cannot be found" or "is not there in the first place."? Since, when an object is known, how do you deny there being someone who has done the knowing of the object? 

if one thinks of it human society is completely defiled with criminal activities being only one aspect, and doing almost any job, not just law enforcement and policing, and especially those requiring interaction with other people, involve activities, decisions and strategies incompatible with elements of the Buddhist ethics and ethics period in many cases the very performance of job duties run into moral dilemmas 

if by being a part-time monk we mean not being fully committed to spiritual practice, while observing Vinaya nonetheless, then i again believe it's possible to me it appears that a bhikkhu status is defined not necessarily by genuine and honest spiritual practice but by formal and mechanical observance of the Vinaya and even that may not be entirely flawless 

Bhikkhu sutta (SN 22.36) generally i agree that the dhammic idea and the concept of disidentification bear similarity the terms disjoined, fetterred, detached in this context i understand as meaning being dissociated from psychological phenomena, and from personal experience i can attest that physical pain is endured much easily when you don't associate with it, don't take it as your own and assume an observer and bystander attitude towards it instead 

expounded in the Cunda sutta (AN 10.176) in particular the Buddha was rarely categorical about dos and don'ts, being rather a proponent of analytic approach, whos apt expression is found in the Vajjiya sutta (AN 10.94) 

actually everything is in the suttas and for the purpose of the answer Buddhism i equate with Buddhadhamma, not sure what meaning the inquirer imparts it 

i think it depends on the attitude and the frame of mind a care to keep in mind the fact that it's a business of maintaining fitness of a frail and mortal bag of bones and impurities may negate the tendency of the attachment to body and self-association with it to become stronger, which such type of activity in my opinion is prone to foster but if one IS a Buddhist they must be able to skilfully counteract that tendency in any case the motive for going to gym for a Buddhist should not be improvement of bodily appearance but rather health considerations in the frame of mind along the lines of the attitude to eating recommended for monks in the suttas 

according to the commentary on Vinaya the Theravadin orthodox view on slavery is of acceptance as a fact of life assistance a slave in escape from the master without mitigating factors is regarded as theft, a grave, parajika, offense, which invariably results in the offender's expulsion with no right to re-join the Sangha in the remaining lifetime ("The Buddhist Monastic Code, Pt 1" by Ven Thanissaro Bhikkhu, p.70) 

human trafficking is not the same as slave employment or exploitation i think Dhammic view at this practice could be likened to the Dhammic view upon meat consumption: if a person wasn't provided as a slave specifically to another person, the slave buyer or owner doesn't incur fault i'm speaking from the point of view of a person accustomed to slavery as a norm, personally i don't advocate or justify it 

you may want to take a look at this list of suttas and Dhammapada verses dealing with anger, hatred, aggression and hostility just one example from Theragatha Brahma­datta 6.12 

the only motivation possible is the internal readiness to cultivate the mind and the virtue, understanding that this is what's the Noble Eightfold Path is about the motivation to follow the path proposed by the Buddha comes from the very understanding of the 4 Noble Truths at least at the intellectual level so if one does have desire to end suffering they'll follow the path which facilitates attainment of that goal, and strive for proper maintenance of mindfulness if such understanding and desire are not there, then there's no point in forcing oneself and looking for other types of motivators speaking of hunger, it's the same as forcing oneself to eat without being hungry or even have an appetite if one understands the concept of suffering but the understanding still doesn't engender enough will power to follow the Path, there's a good chance that the understanding isn't profound enough and so more reflection on suffering and its ubiquity is probably required here maranasati may come in handy to develop a certain degree of samvega Maranasati sutta 1 (AN 6.19) Maranasati sutta 2 (AN 6.20) in the Capala sutta (AN 7.58) the Buddha instructs Ven Moggallana on the strategies of dispelling drowsiness during meditation, which may be of help in cases of waning mindfulness in the Vitakkasanthana sutta (MN 20) the Buddha explains how to counteract unskillful mental states with appropriate attention in the Aggi sutta (SN 46.53) he explains what mental states are appropriate for development of certain factors of awakening
