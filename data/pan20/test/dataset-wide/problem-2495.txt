Most importantly, we should not forget the main purpose of training rules: to help one "curb the grosser forms of defilements" (Bro. Chan Khoon San): 

This is not how it works. You don't literally "escape impermanence", instead your perception of reality changes in such a way when impermanence no longer matters. Enlightenment is not becoming a Superman. It's more like getting able to see the true nature of "The Matrix". Again, this is not a literal change in how you see stuff, it is a fundamental change of one's mental framework and therefore of one's interpretation. 

The reason the breath is watched (as was explained by Trungpa Rinpoche) is because breath is the window onto the state of mind, or rather, the state of the entire mind-emotions-body continuum: 

There is no conflict, the dichotomy is false and is based on incorrect understanding. As Buddha said in Sedaka Sutta: 

Easy. Well, easy in theory :) -- you need to get fed up! You need to get really sick and tired of your conditions, so sick that you cannot live like that anymore. You are so fed up that you are either ready to die - or to change your habits. So that desire to get out leads to iron intent to change. 

Dirgha Agama Thanks to the reference contributed by ChrisW, I was able to find the following fragments: 

because this entails acting out of desire for pleasure, because this upsets, not gladdens, the minds of whoever conceive themselves as the owners, and because this involves the parasitic attitude of getting something for nothing. 

Systematically work to identify and let go of attachments to opinions and generalizations, especially ones that stir emotions. Meditate. Just take a moment to sit down and sit, no need for instructions. Read some Buddhist books and think about them. Try to see how they map to your day-to-day life. 

Yes, it's what you attend to, you are correct. Sometimes thinking about the future is useful though, as in forecasting results of your action before you do it. But generally speaking yes, one can make oneself miserable by focusing on the wrong things, or once can make oneself strong. The effort is the same, it's what you focus on. If you let your attention go to things that cause craving, your mind can get infected by desire. If you focus on the negative side of things, you will maintain yourself in wounded and miserable condition. If you focus on good things, you can learn to enter and stay in first jhana. 

Sankhara-khandha (samskara-skandha) is a functional group providing material for assembling of phenomena. It is made of imprints left by previous experiences, known as vasanas - elementary memories or associations. The canonical sayings about Sankhara include (the idiomatic translation is mine): 

I'm sure Sleeping Tiger meditation can help with this, if you can learn to tolerate the pain. The idea is to hold this very inconvenient posture for 20 minutes, while concentrating the mind on the lower abdominal breathing. While very painful for most people, it does miracles to one's ability to concentrate and follow through on things! 

It is said that beginner practitioners ("hinayana") only understand corelessness of beings (anatta), but still assume various stuff to be objectively/ontologically existing. This results in them erroneously reifying such concepts as the five skandhas, 12 nidanas, 4 noble truths, nirvana, and enlightenment. Advanced practitioners ("mahayana") clearly understand that all knowable phenomena without exception are contextually defined composites. Another classification scheme I like is the one used by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche: 

What's known as "Right View with tincture" (aka expedient Right View) is not similar to Scientific Fervor at all. What's known as "Right View without tincture" (or the resulting Right View) could be similar to Scientific Fervor in some ways and at odds with it in other ways. Summarizing/extrapolating e.g. MN 117, we can get the following components of the Right View with tincture: 

It's not thinking-about-the-future itself that makes us unhappy, it is attachment to a certain way we want the future to be, and fear of another way the future could end up being. The unhappiness is caused by our attachment to e.g. stability, comfort etc. First thing we learn in Buddhism is to give up our attachments to our preconceived notions of how things are "supposed to be". 

Alan Watts - Not a formal monk, but he has several philosophical discussions that complement the study of the dharma. Resources: 

As you can see, in all truth, I have no idea what I'm talking about. But here are a couple of links that may shed more light on this obscure topic: 

In fact, Buddhism is so radically practical (much more radically than other philosophies) that it does not shy away from using tricks, like the fear of hell etc. because they too are kusala, conducive to benefit. Such tricks are called upaya ("skilfull means"). This is similar to how parents use tricks to protect their very young children who don't yet understand reason. But just like upbringing the children is not limited to tricks, there is a lot more to Buddhism than upaya. What do we teach children? Proper behavior, Deep knowledge, and Hard work. Why do we teach them this? Because it will help them in their life. Similarly, in Buddhism, we don't just scare people with hell. We teach them how to control their mind. Why? Because it helps them with their life! When mind is untrained, it gets easily obsessed by ideas. When mind is obsessed by ideas, it gets inflamed with emotions. Getting inflamed with emotions, one does not know what's good / what's bad. Then one starts acting based on this confused understanding of good and bad. And then one hurts oneself and others! And vice versa, when mind is trained, it is not easily obsessed ==> not blinded with emotions ==> it clearly sees what's good / what's bad ==> and therefore it can act well. Very practical. That's why they say Buddhism is good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end. When naive people follow it as religion, without understanding why, it protects them from harm -- this is good in the beginning. When people practice it seriously, taming their mind, it helps them handle all kind of life problems and increases social harmony -- this is good in the middle. Finally, when they solve the problem of Life-and-Death and achieve Completion -- this is good in the end. And how do you tame the mind? First, by watching it continuously, every second of every minute of every hour, and identifying any sign of pathological clinging. Clinging to material possession, clinging to relationships and respect, clinging to comfort, well-being, stability, clinging to principles and ideals, clinging to fairness, clinging to skills, talents, intellect, success, control, clinging to plans for the future, clinging to spirituality, clinging to Buddhism, and even clinging to not-clinging! When you make anything all-important, you lose it and get very upset -- that's pathological clinging. As soon as you notice clinging, you must let go ASAP, otherwise it will get you in trouble. The feeling when you let go of clinging is like you are sobering up from liquor. Second, mind is tamed by watching it for any signs of ego-motivated behavior. Whenever you notice yourself doing something seemingly right, but secretly (even from yourself) showing off, or defending your fault, or retaliating -- this is ego-motivated behavior. As soon as you notice even a little flavor of that, you need to surrender your ego to the world, which is acting as your teacher at that moment. This feels scary, similar to skydiving. As you train like this very carefully, stalking yourself and keeping your mind free from even the smallest clinging or ego-motivated thought, within 5-10 years you will notice a huge positive difference in your life. This is basic training, this is how my teachers taught me -- as you see, it is very practical. Now, to address the last part of your question, about "fear of getting into sadness" -- yes, Buddhism very much depends on the fact that people don't want to be sad, that people are afraid of suffering. This is how Buddhism defines good and bad, or kusala and akusala: good is what leads to happiness, and bad is what leads to suffering. This basic difference serves as the gasoline for the engine of Buddha-Yana (vehicle of awakening). One thing that Buddha was strongly against is nihilistic philosophy that denies distinction between good and bad. So yes, Buddhism can be very useful to a modern practical society, but we need to go deeper, beyond the tricks of upaya and into the real practice of liberating the mind from pathological clinging and egoistic neuroses, and train it to not get obsessed with ideas and blinded with emotions, so it can clearly see what's good / what's bad for oneself and for everybody. 

Realms #21 and 22 is a reference to mindstates of non-buddhist practitioners succeeding in meditation. Even though they may achieve bliss (#21) or suspension of consciousness (#22) because of their Wrong View they are bound to fall back to the lower realms. Metaphorical illustrations like these help the practitioners of Buddhism understand the subtle differences between correct and incorrect practices at advanced stages of the path.
