Speaking as a Marxist historian, the question we should ask is not "which country exemplifies capitalism" as capitalism is a constantly changing phenomenaâ€”rather we should ask which country best exemplifies capitalism in particular historical moments, and (moreover) who considers the country to exemplify capitalism and why? For example: Holland is probably the premier example of mercantile capitalism prior to the French revolution. England was the typifying example of capitalism in the 19th century for Marx and Engels. It was also the typifying example for the Manchester School and The Economist. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Germany's advanced production techniques meant that it was held as an example of the second phase of the industrial revolution. Since the 1890s the United States has been pointed to as a pinnacle of capitalist achievement, particularly in its early and thorough-going implementation of Fordism-Taylorism. The Soviet Union was upheld by Cliff and others as an example of the highest stage of capitalism, capitalism encountering its own negation. Finally if we look at China's current capacity to accumulate surplus value, surely this indicates that China's state capitalist and private capitalist economies working in coordination exemplifies the contemporary ultimate in accumulation. Given that my background is firmly Marxist, and I view capitalism as a system for accumulation of surplus value in an expanded form, I have concentrated this list on societies which were successful at accumulating surplus value in an expanded form, and societies which engaged in innovative ways of accumulating. These societies expanded the number of useful things in life that were considered commodities, expanded wage labour, and increased the total pool of useful things and human wealth that operated as "value," ie as capitalised value or wage labour. Hopefully someone from a normative perspective can answer in terms of the moralism of "ideal" capitalism. 

"The State" is a theoretical concept in social science. It has two common definitions, "a body of armed men," and "the method of one class's political repression of all other classes." The definition being used in your world history text is the first definition. A strong state is one which then fulfills the core requirements of maintaining a body of armed men in its circumstances. Stronger states will maintain a body of armed men in a way which makes the dissolution of that capacity less likely. This isn't just numbers or quality, but also the soft power that results in population growth, legitimacy and capacity to mobilise, the ability to bind outlying semi-governed polities beneath a central or networked will. Less strong states will be susceptible to invasion, successful or unsuccessful revolution or revolt, mass resistance to basic policies (tax, land, family structure) or esoteric policies (customing of luxury goods, public nuisance, courtesy within a single class). Strong states possess the possibility to impose their will internally and externally, in the final instance by force. Weak states lack this capacity. Not all "weak states" are necessarily weak countries or nations. A state is not a country, nor a nation, nor a revolutionary class. French states during the great revolution were weak until Napoleon, with rapidly changing policy aims, and a comparatively disorganised military. New innovations in nationalism and non-state networks of power allowed the communities and community of France to enact decisions, despite the weak state. Similarly with these early United States. Using the second definition, not present in your textbook, a strong state is one that would ensure continued class rule by the socially dominant class. While this obviously has elements of defence of the state against external threats, states are quite willing to fold as long as the system of class rule is maintained (Franco-Prussian War, the English crown's possessions in France). Correspondingly, this second definition of a "strong state" places more emphasis on capacity for internal class repression, or repressive desublimation. This can mean cross-class alliances. A classic example would be the post-war welfare state / full-employment / low inflation nexus in capitalism. This reduced profit and increased the social strength of the working class, but also reduced working class militance. This kind of state extends outside of formal government, and into hegemonic apparatus and the workplace itself. 

Authorial ignorance. It doesn't test the scope of knowledge of the author Authorial context. Similar texts produced in the similar time. General source context. Survival rate. Did only controversial idiocy survive in the libraries. Did this survive monastery burning because it was being used to insulate a bamboo wall? Reception context at time of authoring. Did everyone know that "relocated to the East" meant burnt in an execution camp. Internal purposes. Documents written for internal consumption (beer barrel receipts) are often more trustworthy about what they lie about than documents written for external consumption (all our monks are sober, the broadsheet bill) Transmission of the text. Forgery, reinvention, copying, selection for survival Language of text. SMSes from protestors in London are not going to sound like, "I have found a great and not very well protected big screen television store here at grid ref follow." Internal consistency, is this actually a single text? Is it a text of texts, is it a chapbook, Fred's favourite quotes, a hypertext of biblical references? Modern presentation of the text, is this presented in an undergraduate or highschool textbook as illustrative? Why? Which sources were excluded? Is it actually representative, or atypical? 

No, and yes. Late in WWII there was a request from a faction of Polish Communists for a Polish SSR. This did not come to pass. Instead multiparty state formations were set up with two major gaps in the political spectrum: anti-democratic parties were excluded, and social democratic parties were forcibly merged into workers' parties controlled by the Communists. From 1944 through 1958 (more or less), the Soviet Union deeply coordinated policy with Warsaw Pact states. In fact, it is worth considering the Tito-Stalin split and the 1949 purges as a clear example of the limits of this moment of Soviet-Central European relations. Yugoslavia's involvement in Comecon planning collapsed overnight, and the Soviet Union prepared plans and conducted operations for [what would have been a fool-hearty] invasion of Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union had sleeper agents in fraternal parties, it had non-agents who were more Stalinist than Stalin, and fraternal parties were regularly purged along with civil society. 

For Mikoyan, at least some of these factors were viewed with great favour. For Lukacs (interview, published by Outlook as a pamphlet, consult National Library Australia) some of these were positive, some were unavoidable. For the main line in the Political Committee these were abominations as they threatened the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's exclusive rule. The changes threatened two things: 

This question is unanswerable: 1) Silver is not a useful measure on the scale required: money did not exist to purchase commodities for most of the desired time scale 2) Adequate wage/price series only become available in the mid 19th century, inadequate wage/price series only become available in the early 19th century 2a) Wage/price series are important because silver itself has a price, as discovered in the 19th century by a variety of political economics, Ricardo obviously, Marx gives a useful snapshot of the debate in Grundriesse's chapter on money. To establish some measure of stability, time series are constructed out of measures that appear to have some value over time: %GDP, GDP/capita, or "consumption bundles." Consumption bundles come down to wages through the relatively stable assumptions: workers consume their entire wages immediately or in deferred forms, the social expectations of waged consumption represent a social measure of "acceptable" living. Consumption bundles then give reference to prices in terms of a reflection on the socially accepted standard of living for people who worked for a living. This is fairly useful in that dietary habits don't actually change during crises (Hammond and Hammond's labourers series on the bread / oatmeal / potato consumption habits), which means that price rises in bread become apparent. Not useful in terms of dealing with fiat money, because again, our 19th century political economist friends identified that the paper money supply is a capital, not a domestic wage labourer, consumed commodity. 3) Bread was not bought for money for the vast majority of humanity through-out history, which gives a "no sensible answer" result 

I relate to economic history as a modern social historian, but reading Measuring Worth's discussion of the problems with post 1950 wage/price series ought to be illustrative, as should the history of the Australian C series index which is available on Australian Bureau of Statistics' website for the Australian CPI index. 

There are strong countervailing tendencies such as the requirement to preserve the commodity form (reaction, fascism, bastard capitalisms like the Soviet Union); or, the opportunities of primary accumulation through enslavement (Federici's Caliban and the Witch); or, the requirement to preserve the commodity form (industrial democracy, works councils). These effects don't occur at the national level either, but in terms of transnational structures of capital ("imperialism," "the metropole/the periphery"); though obviously capital has been provincial or national at different times. Any answer to this question will necessarily import a theoretical perspective. 

I'm looking at "The Good Old Days" The Holocaust as Seen by Its Perpetrators and Bystanders, and at the Police Battalion studies, and I'm still thinking functionalism is more explanatory than intentionalism. Ordinary Germans, including the vast majority of the Wehrmacht, shared a racialist politics and during the circumstances of the war shared a common attitude towards resolving the racial problems of Jews and eastern and southern Slavs. Hitler's involvement was not decisive, as the rate of spontaneous massacre and the mixed class background of the Police Battalion soldiers demonstrates. Expanded: The historiography of the holocaust emphasises two causative accounts (both explained in depth at wikipedia with adequate citations there). The first is "intentionalism," this broadly focuses on Hitler's unique culpability for the decisions behind the holocaust, or limits these decisions to the inner circle of the NSDAP leadership or the Wehrmacht. Much of the US case at Nuremberg was intentionalist in its attitude to the causes of war crime. Later scholarship evidenced the mass and widespread culpability of Wehrmacht soldiers, and in particular second line soldiers such at the soldiers of the Police Battalions. These soldiers were ordinary Germans. In the case of the Police Battalion studies, it was demonstrated that the class and occupational composition of these Battalions directly mirrored the class and occupational composition of Germany as a wholeâ€”they were representative males. In particular, they were older males who under the intentionalist schema of "brainwashed SS boys" should not have engaged in mass killings. But in the East, and in the West, and in the Southâ€”but, most particularly in the East and South (Soviet Union and Yugoslavia)â€”these ordinary men engaged quite willingly in voluntary Jew hunting and massacres of civilians. Evidence accumulated that Jew hunting and massacres were entirely voluntary, and that soldiers who showed no willingness to engage in massacres were allowed without punishment, scorn or humiliation to not engage in these activities. Jew hunting was discovered to be constructed as leisure by ordinary soldiers. This greatly strengthened the "functionalist" side of the argument, that the holocaust emerged out of functional requirements of the entire German war, that mass massacres and genocide were the ordinary business and outcome of war. Genocide studies has furthered these findings. Current work in genocide studies engages the individual "massacre" as the unit of analysis, rather than the entire genocide. In part this is done because of the understanding developed from the German studies of the importance of ordinary participants and their attitudes. While I primarily read genocide studies in the field of Soviet atrocities and attempts to analyse Soviet and Soviet-style atrocities as a singular whole, my understanding is that placing "Hitler" or "Nazism" as central to the holocaust is widely discredited; even where the unique contributions of Nazi ideology or organisational doctrine gave the holocaust distinctive colour. Historians rarely accept dichotomies without showing how they interpenetrate; but crude intentionalism is clearly discredited. Hitler was not directly responsible for the holocaust, except of course that he tolerated it, encouraged it, sought to order it, and perceived the German desire for it. (Here you should consider reading about the history of Einsatzgruppen A in the Baltic states, its composition, and its eventual failure to achieve its stated aims due to psychological wear and tear. Einsatzgruppen A was comprised of NSDAP ideologues with higher University degrees, who believed in the racial purification of Germany and its mission of Empire in the Eastâ€”and even they proved incapable of continuous intimate massacre despite their ardent beliefs in the NSDAP mission.) Soldiers did not have to be motivated by or for Hitler to engage in atrocities. Atrocities were a historical part of the German method of waging war. (Even as they were part of the Japanese, or British, or Australian, or Soviet ways of waging war.) German soldiers voluntarily and with eagerness began implementing the basic program of the holocaust, and would have done so in the Soviet Union even without widespread official encouragement and support from directly NSDAP motivated and controlled organisations such as the Einsatzgruppern. In particular, the commissar order and anti-partisan operations were conducted with gusto and enjoyment. Germans also broadly agreed with the racial categories the NSDAP used, largely because the NSDAP's ideology was a mirror of German racialism. German soldiers did not set out to kill six million Jews. They set out to punish Jews, Slavs and Communists as categories. The actual result of this was tens of millions of dead central and eastern europeans. Jews were especially singled out for special treatment in this schema, but the programme was the broad punishment including by collective death by massacre or starvation of Eastern and Southern Slavs generally, and specific cultural groups like Roma or Jews in particular. Even the formerly social democratic or communist German soldiers, such as in the police battalions, identified with the goal of punishing Jews and Slavs. Sometimes this punishment involved forced labour (conducted primarily as a form of ritualised humiliation with Jews, rather than for primarily economic gain). Sometimes this involved mass murder, industrial deportation of populations for a widely recognised final solution, or death marching prisoners with insufficient sources of food, clothing, shelter or medicine with a full awareness of the results. Most current work points to the capture of large numbers of Soviet POWS in the transition from sporadic massacre to systematic attempts to destroy entire population groups, a "functionalist" analysis. POW camps for Soviet soldiers were run with a mentality of causing large scale deaths. However, intentionalists can point to the NSDAP plans for the annihilation by starvation of all Jews and most Slavs West of the projected 1941 stop lines over the 1941-1942 winter. Indeed, the Wehrmacht's occupation planning attempted to implement just this. The targets of the holocaust, both in the minds of ordinary Germans, and in the planning of the NSDAP organs and organs that predated the NSDAP such as the junker dominated military synchronised in 1941. (Much of this comes out in Soviet evidence to Nuremberg which was always more functionalist). Finally the question of how could soldiers willingly and consistently execute thousands of people day in day out? They couldn't. Einsatzgruppen A broke down under the psychological stress of mass executions, even using Baltic Hiwis to do the nasty work. Jew hunting and anti-partisan massacres were highlights, rewards, in the boring life of rear area policing. For front line units seconded to anti-partisan or clearance operations, they provided a welcome relief and a source of leisure in a far lower intensity environment. 

Hypotheticals belong to what is known as speculative history or allohistory, sometimes as alternate history. To substantiate a hypothetical you need a theory of causation. "However, if the US had granted the Philippines independence back in 1901, would Japan still have felt the need to go to war?" This question asserts that the Empire of Japan went to war with the United States because of US control over the Philippines. Such a causal theory in actuality is demonstrably false. The immediate cause of the war was the presence of a culminating battle grand strategy in the Imperial Japanese Navy combined with the United States immediately hostile behaviour towards Japanese Imperialism in China and the colonies of France, The United Kingdom and Holland. The intermediate cause of the war between Japan and the United States was competing imperial and neo-imperial interests, mainly voiced over the division of China's economy. Particularly due to the Showa racialist ideology in Japan and the export of Christian liberal-democratic ideology in the United States. (A world-systems / Marxist Imperialist analysis of cause, fairly solid at this level of analysis). The final cause of the war was the Imperialist stage of capitalism, the development of neo-colonial economics in the United States involving loosely held colonies under nominal self-governance (or development to the same), and the racialist ideology of post-Restoration Japan and the increasing power of the networks of Trusts in the United States and their international imperial ambitions rooted in the Gilded Age. So no, changing the formal nature of US control over the Philippines in 1901 would not change the conflict of interests between the emerging Showa racialist ideology and US liberalist neo-colonialism. However, it may "butterfly" the specifics of war between Japan and the United States, particularly if Japanese and US imperialist interests can be united against some other force in the area, particularly if the Trusts of the United States gain an interest in seeing Japanese control over China.
