Let $V$ be an affine variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $D \subset V$ a Cartier divisor which is normal and has an isolated singularity at $p \in D$. Let $\mathcal{O}_V^*, \mathcal{O}_D^*$ be the sheaves of invertible functions on $V$ and $D$. Then I think that we have an exact sequence $0 \rightarrow K \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_V^* \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_D^* \rightarrow 0$. Question (Edited) Is there an affine open neighbourhood of $p \in V' \subset V$ such that $H^0(V', \mathcal{O}_{V'}^*) \rightarrow H^0(D', \mathcal{O}_{D'}^*)$ is surjective where $D':= D \cap V'$? That is, can we lift a surjection of stalks to that on some open neighbourhood? I think the Question is reduced to the following. Question' Is the cokernel of $H^0(V, \mathcal{O}_{V}^*) \rightarrow H^0(D, \mathcal{O}_{D}^*)$ finitely generated as an abelian group? 

Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ (or a normal complex space). I found the word "equivariant resolution" in several papers on singularity theory or deformation theory. I think that it means the birational proper morphism of complex spaces $f: Y \rightarrow X $ where $Y$ is a complex manifold such that $f_{\ast} \Theta_Y \simeq \Theta_X$ where $\Theta_X$ is the tangent sheaf, i.e. the dual of the Kahler differential sheaf on $X$ and $\Theta_Y$ is the tangent sheaf on $Y$. Question 1 Does that equivariant resolution always exist for an complex algebraic variety $X$? Question 2 Can $Y$ be taken as an smooth algebraic variety? If you know the reference, please let me know about it. In Wahl's paper on equisingular deformations, the preprint by Hironaka was cited but I couldn't find it. 

Let $X$ be a normal projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $D \subset X$ be a reduced ample Cartier divisor which is normal. Then we have a restriction homomorphism $r \colon {\rm Cl} X \rightarrow {\rm Cl} D$ and $r_{\mathbb{Q}} \colon {\rm Cl} X \otimes \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow {\rm Cl} D \otimes \mathbb{Q}$. Question Assume that $\dim X \ge 3$. Is $r_{\mathbb{Q}}$ injective? Actually, I can assume that $\dim X = 3$, $X$ and $D$ have only rational hypersurface singularities and $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X) = 0 = H^2(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$. 

Let $D,E \subset \mathbb{C}^3$ be prime divisors where $D$ is smooth and $E$ is not necessarily smooth. Assume that $D \cap E$ has SNC support and let $D \cap E = \bigcup \Gamma_i$ be a decomposition into irreducible components. (Added) Let $f_1 \colon X_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^3$ be a blow-up along a smooth curve $\Gamma_i$ and $\tilde{D}_1 \subset X_1$ be the strict transform of $D$. $f_1$ induces an isomorphism $g_1 \colon \tilde{D}_1 \rightarrow D$. There is a SNC curve $\bigcup \Gamma^1_i \subset \tilde{D}_1$. We next blow-up one of $\Gamma^1_i$. Question Is it possible to make the strict transforms of $D$ and $E$ disjoint by blowing-up smooth curves $\Gamma_i$ or its strict transforms on the strict transforms of $D$ several times? I know that the blow-up of $\mathbb{C}^3$ along the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_D + \mathcal{I}_E$ makes $D$ and $E$ disjoint. However I want the smooth centre blow-ups. (My thought which uses Karl Schwede's answer comment) Let $\pi:Y \rightarrow X$ be a principalization of $I_D + I_E$ as in Karl Schwede's answer. Let $Z \subset X$ be a finite set which is the union of the images of the smooth points centers. I think that $\pi^{-1}(X \setminus Z) \rightarrow X \setminus Z$ is the blow-ups of smooth curves $\Gamma_i \setminus Z$ or their strict transform curves on the strict transforms of $D$. Let $\pi': Y' \rightarrow X$ be a composite of blow-ups of the smooth curves $\Gamma_i$ or its strict transform inside strict transforms of $D$ which are in same order as $\pi$. That is, we can define $\pi'$ by forgetting smooth points centers and curve centers which are contained in the inverse image of smooth point centers. $\pi'$ is same as $\pi$ outside $Z$. Let $\tilde{D}', \tilde{E}' \subset Y'$ be the strict transforms of the original divisors $D, E \subset X$. If $\tilde{D}' \cap \tilde{E}' \neq \emptyset$, then $\tilde{D}' \cap \tilde{E}' \subset \pi'^{-1}(Z) \cap \bigcup \tilde{\Gamma}'_i$ and it is finite points. This is a contradiction since $\tilde{D}', \tilde{E}'$ are Cartier divisors on a smooth 3-fold $Y$. Hence $\tilde{D}' \cap \tilde{E} = \emptyset$. Sorry for the long sentence, but I think that the idea is simple. I just ignored centers which is concerned with 0-dimensional centers. Are there gaps in this argument? 

Let $X_1, X_2$ be two smooth complex manifold and $C_1 \subset X_1, C_2 \subset X_2$ be two smooth projective curves. Assume that $C_1 \simeq C_2$ as complex curves and their normal bundles are isomorphic. Q. Is it possible to take two analytic open neighbourhoods $U_1 \subset X_1$ and $U_2 \subset X_2$ of $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that there is an isomorphism of complex manifolds $U_1 \simeq U_2$ which sends $C_1$ to $C_2$? That is, are two complex germs $(U_1, C_1)$ and $(U_2, C_2)$ same? If not, is there some useful criterion? 

Let $X$ be a normal projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$ whose anticanonical divisor $-K_X$ is ample $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier. Assume that $X$ has only KLT singularities but not canonical. Question Is there an example of $X$ such that the anticanonical system $|{-}K_X|$ contains a normal element $D$? Or, if $D$ exists, is it always non-normal? By adjunction, $D$ is not canonical but Gorenstein. If $\dim X =2$, I think $D$ is non-normal by the adjunction reason since $D$ is singular then non-normal. I want to know the cases $\dim X \ge 3$ or $=3$ in particular. Sorry, it seems that $\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,n)$ is a typical example. I will perhaps close this question. 

Let $X \rightarrow Y$ be a birational projective morphism between smooth varieties over $\mathbb{C}$. I think that the exceptional locus $E \subset X$ of $f$ is codimension $1$. Assume that $\dim X = \dim Y =3$. Question Is $E$ normal crossing? If you know counterexample, please let me know. 

Let $X$ be a Calabi-yau 3-fold, that is, $X$ is a smooth projective 3-fold such that $K_X$ is trivial and $h^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X)=0$. Question Is it easy to find $X$ whose nef cone is not "rational", that is, the nef cone does not coincide with the convex hull of rational points on the nef boundary? 

Let $U= (f=0) \subset \mathbb{C}^3$ be an isolated hypersurface singularity of dimension $2$. Let $\mu: \tilde{U} \rightarrow U$ be its minimal resolution. Question Is there an example of $U$ such that the exceptional locus $E$ of $\mu$ is not normal crossing? 

Let $X$ be a normal projective variety which has only terminal singularities. Let $\Omega^1_X$ be the Kahler differential sheaf on $X$ and $\omega_X$ be the dualizing sheaf on $X$. For a coherent sheaf $F$ on $X$, let $F^{* *}$ be its double dual. Question Are ${\rm Ext}^2 ((\Omega^1_X)^{* *}, \mathcal{O}_X)$ and ${\rm Ext}^2 ((\Omega^1_X)^{* *} \otimes \omega_X, \omega_X) $ isomorphic? If $X$ is Gorenstein, they are isomorphic. I want to know the situation when $X$ is non-Gorenstein. 

Let $U$ be a smooth variety, $m >1$ be a positive integer and $D_{m,U} \in | {-}m K_U|$ be a smooth irreducible divisor. Let $\pi: V_m:= Spec \bigoplus_{i=0}^{m-1} \mathcal{O}_U(i K_U) \rightarrow U$ be a cyclic cover determined by $D_{m,U}$. Assume that $|-K_U|$ contains a smooth irreducible member $D_U$ and put $D_{V_m}:= \pi_m^{-1}(D_U)$. Consider the logarithmic differential sheaves $\Omega^1_{V_m}(\log D_{V_m})$ and $\Omega^1_U(\log D_U)$. Question 1 $\Omega^1_{V_m} (\log D_{V_m}) \simeq \pi_m^* \Omega^1_U(\log D_U)$ ? Question 2 Let $(\pi_m)_* \Omega^1_{V_m}(\log D_{V_m}) =: \bigoplus \mathcal{F}_i$ be the eigendecompposition with respect to the $\mathbb{Z}/ m\mathbb{Z}$-action where $\mathcal{F}_i$ is the sheaf of sections of eigenvalue $\zeta^i$ ($\zeta$ is the $m$-th primitive root of unity). Is $\mathcal{F}_1 \simeq \Omega^1_U (\log D_U)(-D_U)$? If it's not, can you describe $\mathcal{F}_i$ explicitly? I saw the book by Esnault-Viehweg. Are there other references on that topic? (add) I can see that Question 1 is wrong by the arguments in the Sándor Kovács' answer. 

Let $f \in \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ be a polynomial which defines an isolated singularity $0 \in D:= (f=0) \subset \mathbb{C}^3$. Assume that $\mathcal{D}:= (f+tx =0) \subset \mathbb{C}^3 \times \mathbb{C}$ defines a smoothing of $D$ over a small disk. Let $g \in \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ be a polynomial which has a zero of order $\ge 2$ at $0$. Question Let $\mathcal{D}' := (f+t(x+g)=0)$ be a deformation of $D$ induced by $x+g$. Is $\mathcal{D}'$ smoothing? 

Let $V$ be a complex manifold and $D \subset V$ a smooth divisor. Question 1 Is $H^i(V \setminus D, \mathbb{C}) \simeq \mathbb{H}^i ( V, \Omega^{\bullet}_V(\log D)) $ ? Question 2(Edited) Ok, 1 is true. Is it possible to define naturally a homomorphism $H^2(V \setminus D, \mathbb{C}) \rightarrow H^1(V, \Omega_V^1 (\log D))$? (In my case $V$ is of the form $U \setminus p $ where $U$ is a $3$-dimensional smooth Stein space and $D$ is of the form $\Delta \setminus p$ where $\Delta \subset U$ is a divosor with an isolated singularity at $p$. Then $H^1(V, \Omega_V^1 (\log D))$ is the set of 1st order deformations of the pair $(U, \Delta)$. Since $\Delta$ has only isolated singularities, this is finite dimensional.) I think it is true when $V$ is compact. How about non-compact case?
