Holmes specifically says that Watson "saw [...] the first exchanges", and Watson's first encounter with Milverton was within this story - at the beginning of the story, Watson hadn't even heard of him. If Holmes and Milverton had encountered each other before, then that meeting wouldn't have been "the first exchanges" between the pair, and Holmes wouldn't have made that statement. 

Most or all of Thomas Hardy's novels are set in the region of "Wessex", which (as defined by him) covers a vast swathe of England, as you can see from the map provided in this answer: 

He'd already realised, or is in the process of realising what the whole Old vs New Gods war is really all about, either while he was on the tree or even before. Given that the whole thing is a con job cooked up by Odin and Loki, Shadow must be wondering what his own place in all this is. It's unlikely that any of the plan is a coincidence, so the fact that Wednesday hired him, (apparently) an ordinary mortal human, and brought him into the world of gods, is probably less of an accident than it seemed. Perhaps he's already realised that Wednesday needed someone to die for him. Perhaps he's begun to wonder, "why me?" Given how deeply involved with the world of gods he's become in so short a time, it shouldn't really be a surprise that his involvement actually goes back much further. 

His answer to the first question supports what I said above (based on my memory of reading all the Redwall books) about lack of consistency: the size of the animals isn't usually all that relevant to the story, so you can imagine them however you want. (And when it is relevant, it's not always consistent, so thinking too hard about it will break your suspension of disbelief.) Relevant to the second part of the quote above, there's something else to take into account: what TV Tropes has dubbed Early Installment Weirdness. At the time of Redwall, the earliest published book in the series, a lot of what would later become established tropes of the Redwall universe were still in flux. Horses never appear in any of the later books; vehicles such as carts do, but the animals (regardless of species) always seem to fit into them in a comparable way to how humans do in reality, rather than an entire army of vermin fitting into a single cart. So it may be that this mention of a stag beetle's horns fitting nicely on a rat's helmet is something that would never have happened in later books. Generally, you should worry even less about inconsistencies in Redwall than in later books. ... but stag beetles are actually pretty big. However, all that aside, it's not too weird for a stag beetle's horns to be of noticeable size on the helmet of a rat. Stag beetles of the type found in Britain can be nearly 8cm long, while brown rats are around 20-25cm long, not counting their tails. Assuming that Cluny is an unusually large rat, and that the beetle he used was also unusually large (he'd want an impressive battle helm), it would be a little under one-third his size. Imagine a half-metre-long stag beetle compared to an average human man; that doesn't sound too unrealistic for using its horns as a helmet ornament. So your premise that "Beetles are generally... quite smaller than a rat" is incorrect. However, I'll stress again that all of this is way overkill for thinking about animal sizes in the Redwall series. Cf., for example, Urgan Nagru the Foxwolf, who was a fox wearing a wolf's skull on his head: 

On the recommendation of BESW, I recently read the short story "The City Born Great" by N.K. Jemisin. Set in New York, it's all about the 'birth' of a city, and the struggle of these cities against some vague 'Enemy'. The (unnamed) protagonist struggles to help New York to 'breathe' and be 'born', with the help of a man named Paulo, who apparently personifies the city of Sao Paulo. At the end of the story, the protagonist himself has taken on this adviser role in another city, and he now seems to personify New York. How does this personification process work? So many questions are raised - how did his role change from midwife to bearer of the city's soul? how did he become rich after the transformation? will he still have a normal human lifespan, and if so what happens to the city when he dies? - which, as far as I can tell, are left unanswered in the story. So my question is, first, is any of this actually answered somewhere that I've missed - and if not, why is so much left unanswered? What does it add to the story to not explain these things to us? 

You must also remember that many of these limericks are only recorded because nowadays, in the internet age, everything is. A dirty ditty of the 2010s is likely to end up somewhere on the internet to be laughed at; a dirty ditty of the 1950s might have been long lost, never written down in the first place, and exist only in the imperfect memories of people who were young back then. So the particular limerick that Eric Shipton or his expedition comrades remembered might not even exist in written form to be found - it could have been just something he remembered from the schoolyard. TL;DR: finding a specific limerick from 60+ years ago, based only on the information that it featured a lady called Jane who slept with a lot of men, is a nigh impossible task. Unless it happened to be a particularly well-known limerick like the young man from Quebec or the pelican whose beak holds more than his belli-can, but in this case it doesn't seem so. It's more likely to be just one of many obscure, half-forgotten ditties that have been invented by poets, authors, schoolboys, and toilet wall graffitiers for decades untold, few of which have stuck in cultural memory. By the way, I also found your article while researching this question :-) Sorry not to have been of more help! 

George RR Martin's fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire takes a lot of inspiration from real-world history: Hadrian's Wall becomes the Wall in the North, Yorkists and Lancastrians become Starks and Lannisters, and the French Foreign Legion (maybe?) becomes the Night's Watch. What about that other organisation of men who take oaths for life and swear to celibacy, the Kingsguard? Is the Kingsguard based on or inspired by any real-world organisation? Answers based on quotes from GRRM, compelling similarities, or any other good evidence will be welcomed. 

Unfortunately, Wikipedia provides no citation for this claim, and I haven't been able to find out any more information online (I tried searching for the author's name together with "tales for our children" and together with "schools"). How exactly was a book of short stories "use[d] in schools"? Were the stories educational in nature, was it a "cautionary tales" type collection, or were they simply studied in literature class, presumably together with more classical works? 

But the real town of Ephesus, whose spectacular ruins still exist to this day, actually lies several kilometres from the sea. Is this one of Shakespeare's geographical errors, akin to the coast of Bohemia in The Winter's Tale? Or was Ephesus really once a seaport which now lies further from the sea, like Sandwich in Kent? 

To understand this fully requires an understanding of one of the most tricky and esoteric parts of the English legal system: equity law, specifically as it applies to trusts. 

The quote marks around "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" suggests it's a direct quote, but surely Germany and America are also part of western society, and yet Snow apparently held them up as better examples than Britain in this respect. What was he really saying? Did "The Two Cultures" condemn Britain specifically, or the west in general? 

How I found this: after some failures at looking for answers on the internet using various different search terms, I finally discovered here a direct quote from Stevenson, which I could then paste into Google to find its source. 

Like all of Shakespeare's plays, his Julius Caesar is of course written and performed almost entirely in English. But there is one line of this particular play - perhaps the most famous - which is always reproduced in the original Latin: 

I suspect the real answer is that we don't know. The very fact that you've found different sources making different claims about what the initials stand for suggests that there is no 'canonical' answer. Apparently Gibbons never said explicitly what "ABS, LLR" stood for, and others have taken the interpretation of these initials into their own hands. It's even possible that she had no particular words in mind to fit these initials - that, essentially, there is no answer. If she did, surely she would have mentioned them either in the book itself or in some kind of supplementary materials? The initials already convey the idea of "fancy pointless acronyms" even without knowing what they stand for, and perhaps that's all they were intended to do.
