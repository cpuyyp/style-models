As the comments point out, if you're an atheist, then you presumably "believe" in physicalism/materialism/naturalism or some such ism, at least insofar as your remark "justified by the scientific method" is concerned. However, no such observationally-based scientific enterprise has yet accounted for "why there's something rather than nothing". Or in other words, no "theory of everything" yet. So you can't exactly "believe" in any of these ism's, because in all of them "belief" means a demonstrated correspondence between experimental/observational evidence and a theoretical explanatory model. (That's called a "partially interpreted formal system", as elaborated by Max Jammer in his book, The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics.) So the most you can believe=guess is that over the course of time, some such model will be forthcoming. But, until it is forthcoming, you must admit you could be wrong. So the only firmly defensible atheist position is that you're an agnostic who's guessing that the overwhelming likelihood is that some experimentally confirmable explanation of "why there's something rather than nothing" will indeed eventually be forthcoming. Religious people have a much simpler position because "belief" just means faith. Nothing else necessary. And as Joseph Campbell humorously put it (somewhere in his book, The Power of Myth), "If you could prove the existence of God, what would be the value of Faith?" 

I'd basically agree with your position/argument, but wouldn't totally dismiss (maybe 99% dismiss rather than 100%:) the alternatives. Firstly, regarding ... 

Check out Edward G. Robinson's character in the movie Soylent Green (just google that for lots more info), particularly this scene $URL$ where, exactly like you suggest, he voluntarily dies to help mitigate global overcrowding. (And I'd guess you'd find the entire movie pretty interesting and entertaining, though I'm not googling a free viewing of the whole thing online. Harvey Weinstein would've particularly liked the part where rental apartment accoutrements typically included gorgeous live-in concubines, but maybe that's off-topic here:) Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about it. When the time comes, natural selection will see to it that in a world without sufficient resources to support its then-current population, only the fittest will survive. And "fit" may indeed include, as you suggest, those willing to shoot others. But one thing's for sure -- "fit" won't ever include those willing to shoot themselves. P.S. For those who already know the answer... should I spoil it and tell the op what "soylent green" actually is? That oughta provide yet another interesting (if yechy/macabre) ethical question:) 

Like @Alexis's comment says, you're improperly reading way too much into complex analysis, i.e., your interpretation's beyond unwarranted -- it's "not even wrong". Both here and in your preceding identical post Is the Universe real or complex? For example, Electricity&Magnetism textbooks universally describe electromagnetic phenomena using complex analysis, e.g., $URL$ where all those exp{-iwt}'s are complex. You wanna make some paranormal interpretation about the real/complex parts of electromagnetic waves? Or would that be beyond absurdly ridiculous? (And I've got a question: Who upvoted this question?) 

Google pseudorandom number generator, e.g., $URL$ Everything you say is pretty much right, but also pretty much trite. It's all been well-known and well-understood for a long time. 

How about considering the converse (or would it be "inverse"?) question, how to convince you that this world already existed even before you were born. If it didn't already exist, how'd you get here? So, this answer to your converse question seems pretty compelling. But we'd ideally now like to interpret the converse of this answer as the hopefully-equally-compelling answer to your original question. But what's that converse answer??? Seems to sound something like, if the world doesn't still exist after you die, how can you be dead? That is, "nothingness" can't contain any dead people (or even the idea of once-alive-but-now-dead people). And this doesn't sound quite so compelling. Maybe you can work on it. 

Meant as a comment, but too long: my background is physics, not math, per se, and I think you're conflating "physics" and "reality". Physics >>is<< a mostly-mathematical axiomatic model of observable physical behavior (of observable reality). As Jammer puts it (and explains in more detail) in $URL$ physical theory is "a partially interpreted formal system". What you're questioning is whether or not "all of reality" (whatever that is) can be axiomatized (in more or less the way physics is axiomatized). I suppose you're right that would be the limiting case (limiting goal) of physical theorizing, but nobody claims to know whether or not that's achievable (that the limit exists, so to speak). Okay, I suppose some people would claim it's definitely achievable, maybe even some well-known physicists, but read Jammer and others for a more thoughtful view. 

Certainly in this case, not acting is itself an action. It takes no great physical effort to pull the lever. Your only choice is the mental decision whether or not to pull it. So that choice isn't acting or not acting; it's one action versus another action. You can't "not act"; either way you're "acting". Consider a related problem, as follows. The train is barrelling down the tracks, but in such a way so that all six people will be killed. And your lever is in a "neutral" position such that all six will indeed die. But it has two alternative non-neutral positions you can push it to: one where five will die, and the other where one will die. Any question here??? Clearly, the only ethical choice is for you to "kill one". But do nothing and he dies anyway. So you're not really "killing one"; your three choices are "save five" or "save one" or do nothing and "save nobody". Likewise, the original problem just boils down to "save five" or "save one". The "initial condition" that the lever happens to be in the "save one" position just isn't relevant to your ethical decision. Forget about the initial position. Just decide: do you want to save five or do you want to save one? 

I think your point is better made by a more extreme example. Suppose you have a group of ten suspects, among whom nine are definitely completely innocent, while the tenth is definitely guilty. Guilty of what?... of placing a nuclear device somewhere in the center of New York City, that's going to detonate in 60minutes, instantly killing ~one million people, unless you find and defuse it first. This is kind of like the trolley problem, $URL$   With only 60minutes till detonation, there's no time to dilly-dally playing nice. Your only "ethical" choice is to torture the heck out of all ten suspects, to save the million innocents. Of course, the "limousine liberals" will then castigate you for your blatant civil rights (and legal, etc) violations. But how would a more even-keeled history have judged you for letting a million innocent people vaporize in flames? The "ethics" here is just a numbers game, but weighted numbers. That is, you want to minimize the number of people harmed times a weight characterizing the harm they each suffer. When there's no way to achieve "zero", then you just have to make the hard-but-best choice. Your sexual assault example leaves some wiggle room to argue both the numbers and the weights, which is why I suggested a more black-and-white example. 

So, presumably, the same "selfishness threshhold" that might permit you to proceed with Scenario 1, might simultaneously inhibit you from proceeding with Scenario 2 where the risk is so much greater (assuming people value their lives more than their data:). Everbody's selfish to some extent. The only question is the "extent", i.e., how much risk you'll expose others to in furtherance of your own benefit. We've tried to quantify that somewhat by introducing a "selfishness threshhold". While it's far from a perfect measure, just saying (as per your quesion) "I'm a very selfish person", without any further characterization/information, is pretty much meaningless. 

Besides a quantum theory of gravity, etc, as mentioned by @JoWehler, consider the first half-or-so of the 1800's, where we had more-or-less separate theories of electricty and magnetism. That worked fine for inventing the telegraph and similar stuff, and maybe you might have thought "why would we want to unify them [electricty&magnetism]?" But then Maxwell came along in the 1860's and did exactly that (adding a new "displacement current" equation to conserve charge). And then, voila, strange and wonderfgul things emerged that had never before been imagined. For example, by combining the equations for electricity and magnetism, an entirely new equation emerged, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves. Moreover, it predicted the speed of those waves, sqrt(1/mu*epsilon), simply from measurable electronic properties of material (including the vacuum). And that turned out to be exactly the same as the already-measured speed of light, whereby light was finally understood to be an electromagnetic wave. That would never have happened without unifying electricity and magnetism, and we'd never have invented radio, television, etc. Who knows what strange and wonderful new things will emerge from further unification? Quantum electrodynamics has already succeeded in unifying Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and quantum mechanics. And that's indeed revealed wonderful new insights, although nobody's invented a "stargate" or any such thing as an outgrowth of that. Not yet, anyway. And pretty much ditto for the standard model (aka quarks and such stuff), leaving gravity the only not-yet-unified fundamental force. Whether or not unifying them all opens the door to a vast new technological regime of astounding gadgets remains to be seen. But astounding new insights are an absolute certainty. 

Physical systems, more precisely the state of a physical system, is also defined "in terms of what is true about it". In this case, the "true statements" are yes/no propositions that can be operationally tested by constructible apparatus (very much a logical-positivist-like approach, but arising from strictly physical considerations). Then, measuring the yes/no-outcomes for a maximal set of consistent propositions completely determines the measured system's state. Here, "consistent" means simultaneously measurable, i.e., no measurement disturbs the already-determined outcome of any other. And "maximal" means that any additional measurement necessarily distrurbs one or more already-determined outcomes. And, in fact, there's no other way to define a physical system's state. So, not only "can you define...", but you've got no choice "but to define...". Edit... ... too-long-for-a-comment answer to @Gordon's comment below The remarks above are just a standard result. It's typically derived as a quantum result since classical propositions are always consistent (also called "compatible"). But the same idea holds for everyday measurements of macroscopic systems, as follows. Firstly, as I parenthetically remarked above vis-a-vis logical positivism, particularly the verifiability theory of meaning, a proposition is associated with the procedure or apparatus used to verify/measure it. And then the general idea here is that whenever two or more propositions are compatible, you can construct a single apparatus that simultaneously measures them both (or them all). You can see that exactly stated in $URL$ (just above the commutator, Eq.6.25). I'm not sure why Isham calls that "trivially compatible" (I'm not sure how they'd commute otherwise). So let's just overlook that wrinkle (unless somebody can followup with a counterexample). The ultimate upshot of this is that any observable can be decomposed into a maximal set of yes/no-propositions (which are just observables with exactly two possible outcomes/eigenvalues). And that's precisely stated and derived somewhere in Chapter 5 or Chapter 6 of $URL$ But I'm not immediately finding it in my printed copy, which I studied carefully some years (or decades) ago. And google seems reluctant to display entire pages, anyway (though I did notice an easy-to-find pirated pdf you can download, but won't explicitly give out the url). Perhaps the easiest-to-follow discussion comprises the first six pages (right, just six) of $URL$ at which point Schwinger concludes "...the symbol of this compound measurement is...[math elided]...which then describes a complete measurement, such that the system possesses definite values for the maximum number of attributes; any attempt to determine the value of still another independent physical quantity will produce uncontrollable changes in one or more of the previously assigned values." (he didn't seem to have much use for periods) Anyway, the above quote's from pages 5-6 (and you might likely want to read through page 12), but google also seems reluctant to display entire pages of this book, and I'm not seeing any pdf's. Schwinger's subsequent $URL$ develops that discussion much more formally, and is a correspondingly harder read, but google seems willing to display pages. Finally, re Boltzmann, no. These are complete measurements determining pure states, not density matrices determining canonical ensembles. That wouldn't really address the OP's question regarding "things" (I'm taking his "something" to explicitly mean thing rather than ensemble). Whatever philosophical argument you want to have about the definition of "thing", a pure state is as close to "thing" as you're going to physically get. 

No, "contrary conclusions" needn't be "wrong in some way". The simplest example is perhaps modal logics, where the statement "it is raining" may be true for some places while not others, or true for the same place at some times and not others. But that doesn't involve any deduction, per se. In those cases, the choice of appropriate logic typically involves your universe of discourse. For example, a typical classical rule of inference would be,   A==>B     A==>C -------------------------       A==>B&C Now, at first glance you'd perhaps think that might be tautologically true in all universes of discourse. But consider the "vending machine universe" where, say, you can buy a Coke for one dollar, which we'll write 1$==>Coke. And you can also buy a candy bar for one dollar, 1$==>Candy. But now it's wrong to infer that 1$==>Coke&Candy because the dollar gets used up. Slightly more formally, the process of proving the conclusion "uses up" (or "discharges" in the terminology of linear logic) the premises. Constructive logics (substructural logics in general) typically have somewhat different rules of inference than classical logic, often leading to different provable conclusions from the same premises. But that doesn't mean either is "right" or "wrong". 

is indeed correct. The decomposition of reality into "objects" (more technically, aka "subsystems") is more in your mind than you might naively be tempted to think. Coincidentally, just in the last few days, a pretty deep physical and mathematical analysis was published in $URL$ Note the first few sentences of the abstract, "Dividing the world into subsystems is an important component of the scientific method. The choice of subsystems, however, is not defined a priori. Typically, it is dictated by our experimental capabilities, and, in general, different agents may have different capabilities." He (G.Chiribella) goes on (in Section 2) to formally define those "agents", whereby you could interpret yourself (your mind perceiving transformations accomplished by actions of your body and of any equipment you've constructed) as such an "agent". You'll need some math background to follow his development, but (in my opinion) it'll be well worth the effort if you're really interested in this kind of stuff (and I'm pretty sure it has some very significant on-topic insights for this forum).
