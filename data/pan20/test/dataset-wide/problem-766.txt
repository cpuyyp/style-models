Because scientists are now certain that dark matter exists but the exact nature of it is still being investigated. Its extremely important to understand dark matter if we hope to further our knowledge of the universe. Dark matter makes up such a significant part of the total mass of the universe that it must be accounted for in simulations and models of galaxies and other large scale structures in space. Money spent on dark matter research is certainly NOT wasted. 

The file you had linked as 'Detailed NEO Data' lists all the orbital parameters needed to determine the position of the object as a function of time. It lists these parameters for the objects orbiting the earth. This should be just what you need. They are located at bottom of file. There are routines to convert the orbit in orbital parameters to cartesian coordinates. This may be easier to use. You can google on orbital parameters conversion to find these routines. I think I have a copy in Fortran but not many people use Fortran now. 

Earth didn't get here before GW's. GW's have been around since the early universe. We have just recently developed the technology to detect the large gravitational waves associated with very massive disruptions in the fabric of space-time. We also know that our sun is not a 1st generation star, so much of the matter used to create our sun and planets came from a much earlier super-nova explosion. 

You have to remember that the alignment for an eclipse is a very rare situation. It's not as simple as the occurrence of a new moon. The planet and the moon have to align just so in relation to the sun for an eclipse to occur. Sorry, no numbers here but just trying to emphasize that several factors have to occur between 2 fast moving bodies. 

Amazon has solar film sheets if that's what you're looking for. It is sold by Amazon for Thousand Oaks Optical. Amazon sometimes has next day or 2 days delivery. 

Yes. There is a chance of one or more solar flares or CME's occurring during the eclipse and these would be noticeable during totality. There are actually two NASA jets equipped with telescopes and high-speed cameras to film the Corona and any such event. The plane will track the eclipse throughout its duration. 

The gravitational is radial only. That means if you tried a different shape then you would have regions, like hills, where a change in the angle would experience a much less attraction towards the center. This region would, over time, be attracted to a different angle with a greater force of attraction. Or spherical. This results in a spherical-like shape. 

Globular clusters vary in size quite a bit. They contain from a few hundred thousand to over a million stars. Probably best way to determine size is to measure its extent across the sky by telescope and then calculate that distance in km. One could also model the size by assuming the number of stars, the average size of the stars, and the spacing based on this size. One could build a globular cluster of 300,000 stars or so and determine the approximate size. You ask if 120-150 ly is the average diameter of such globular clusters. I'm confused by exactly what you mean but you have sampled a small range of sizes considering globular clusters can be well over 300 ly in diameter. 

Wikipedia has a nice table located here, and here. Maybe of further use is the list of references associated with these tables. There is also a nice illustration depicting the rotational axes of other planets shown here. 

We have seen galaxies around 13 billion years old. Since these galaxies formed so early in the history of the known universe, are there observables about these galaxies that are apparently different from much younger galaxies. I suppose all current physics laws had condensed out by then but was just curious about the formation and 'aging' of such old galaxies. 

It would look as shown below. And yes it would resemble a globular cluster except the stars move differently. Elliptical galaxies have an approximately ellipsoidal shape. Globular clusters are often associated with galaxies. The Milkey Way contains over 150 identified globular clusters. Shown below are globular clusters. 

No it wouldn't make a difference unless you moved it near another star or body. If it was moved such that something was close enough to exert significant gravitational attraction it would have an effect on our solar system. 

As I understood tidal heating, it comes from tidal force acting upon a body as it spins, distorting it; the wave of distortion travels along the surface (along with apparent travel of the other body on the sky) and continued friction as the matter is strained into the traveling wave is the source of tidal heating. Now, if the two bodies are in a tidal lock, the distortion remains constant - it doesn't move. There's no new work done as the bodies remain immobile relative to each other. The tidal heating should be a flat zero. Meanwhile, Io has immense volcanic activity attributed to tidal heating - despite it being tidally locked to Jupiter. While it still heats Jupiter, dragging its own tidal wave around it, Jupiter shouldn't contribute any heat to Io as its distortion remains constant over time, a stable equilibrium. Is that just residual heat from times when Io was spinning or am I missing something? 

The closest thing I could find that would cover more than innermost piece of corona is for sigma binaries. As if solar corona outer reaches were a taboo not to be spoken of, the graphs for it are always cut off way before its peak, never mind fade region. src 

Just to add to TidalWave's answer - something that is easier to simply imagine, the trivial "why". What we call Temperature on thermodynamic level is Speed on atomic level. Saying the medium has a high temperature is equivalent to saying particles of that medium move awfully fast. Well, they must be moving fast. They must be moving faster than the escape speed of the galaxies, or the ones ejected from galaxies wouldn't escape them and the primordial would get captured by the galaxies instead. Being so sparse they collide extremely rarely too - so whatever slowdowns resulting from collisions (expending energy e.g. as photons) simply almost never happens. In short, you're getting particles that were fast (hot) enough to get (and remain) there at all, and had no opportunity to cool down. 

Actually, there exist one "alternate biology" which is fully plausible even if its early origins would be Earth-like: Silicon based, artificial intelligence, robotic physiology, electrical power, proliferation through fully automated manufacturing processes. It's unlikely to produce any detectable chemical signature (at least distinguishable from half of the natural celestial bodies out there), but we are fairly sure its electromagnetic spectrum - radio waves signature - would be quite specific. Well, The SETI project is on it. 

Obviously I wouldn't get very far with high zoom images, as the field of vision would shift away long before I'd get enough light in for a good photo, but obtaining a photo of a fair section of the sky from a relatively wide angle lens should be doable. Is such approach used or even viable? Is there such software "out there" already or would I need to write my own from scratch? 

I'm sure it's a function of atmospheric entry angle, meteorite mass (and possibly composition/density), and its velocity, but what function is it? Above all, how does it depend on velocity? Will the slower meteors impact more often (less kinetic energy to dissipate) or the fast ones (less time spent in the atmosphere = less time to melt and evaporate all the way through)? 

Other sources I found also give the density either as percentage of mass of the universe, or just as mass density like above, $kg/m^3$ or similar. In about all other applications and contexts of usage of energy density, I'd find MJ/L, or other units of energy per volume. Why is energy of density given as mass per volume, and how do I convert it to more familiar units? Using $E=mc^2$ ? 

Generally, these will be low orbit satellites. They are visible when still lit by the sun (visible over the horizon from behind the edge of Earth at their altitude) and they disappear when the enter Earth shadow ("night") and are no longer highlit by the sun. Obviously, that happens only during evening and dawn - in the middle of the night they are in full shadow. 

If I understand correctly, all the current exoplanet search is based on planets transitioning the distant star. If the plane of ecliptic of that star happens to be perpendicular to line of sight from Earth to that star - or sufficiently inclined, so that orbits of all its planets as seen from Earth "circle" the star without ever transitioning it - does that mean we're completely unable to detect them?
