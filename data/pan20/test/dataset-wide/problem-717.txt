I have a pair of Kinetix Pro wheels on my Dahon folder. The front wheel has developed a wobble, so I got out my spoke key to fix it and.... there are no spoke nipples next to the rim. (The slight bulge you can see in the picture is due to the butting of the spoke, it's not a spoke nipple). 

There's not much to add to R. Chung's fantastic answer, but here's some evidence as to why higher cadences are desirable at higher power outputs. Essentially, producing high power at lower cadences requires greater recruitment of fast-twitch fibres, which has been found to deplete glycogen stores in the legs more rapidly. As the glycogen levels drop, the muscle contractions become less forceful, requiring greater muscle recruitment and hence oxygen consumption, plus there will be less glycogen available at later stages over a long ride. Conversely, the higher cadences recruit more slow-twitch fibres, and this was associated with higher levels of fat oxidation and less glycogen depletion. To complicate things further, this study also shows that whilst slower (60-70rpm) cadences tend to minimise oxygen consumption, higher (80-90rpm) cadences minimised neuromuscular fatigue. So in reality the optimal cadence would be based on a combination of power output, ride duration, rider fitness/fatigue and more! 

You should pick up a copy of Allen Lim's cook book "The Feed Zone" the introduction explains a fair amount about exercise physiology. While on endurance pace rides don't eat anything for about the first 1.5 hours, this will train your body to efficiently burn fat. As others have said your body is burning fat in an effort like this, get your body use to that and you'll be surprised how long you can ride without needing to eat. 

It could be that either the star fangled nut itself is spinning or the inserted threads in the nut are spinning. If you take off the front wheel and look up the steerer tube can you see the nut? Is it spinning? It it is spinning just stick a long screw driver up there to hold it in place while you take out the top cap bolt. You can hammer in a new star fangled nut on top of the old broken one. 

Presumably it's possible to true them from the inside of the rim, but if possible I'd rather not rip off the rim tape only to find out that I don't have the right tool - so if anyone knows what I need, I would be very grateful. 

You will need to make sure there is enough frame clearance to fit them. So to answer your question - you don't have to! 

Ok so I presume your tyres are 700x40C. First of all, that pressure sounds high - is it recommended or max pressure? I am sure you could decrease it a fair bit, although if you decrease it excessively you run the risk of pinch puntures. If you do want to change your tyres, 700c road rims and 29" MTB rims are the same diameter, so you can use, for example, a 29x2.0" tyre - if your rim is a suitable width - see the table at the bottom of this page for recommended rim/tyre width combinations EDIT: As armb has quite rightly pointed out, you will also need to check for sufficient frame clearance if fitting wider tyres - and remember you'll need to allow some space for mud accumulation if riding off-road 

Go to $URL$ and click on the "Explore" link. Type in the region that you're interested in, and you'll see bike routes that others have ridden on. It's a great way to find new routes and there's very detailed GPS data (and elevation profiles!) available for each one of those routes. Here's an example of routes that I found for my vacation in Seaside, OR earlier this year. 

Most exercise bikes don't simulate the same riding position that you have on your road bike. If your goal is to improve your performance on your road bike, you'll either need a specialized exercise bike that lets you get in the same position, or you'll need to use your road bike. There really is no substitute for getting miles in using the same position as when you're riding "for real". 

It stopped my bike really quickly and I wound up flying over the handlebars, and earned a trip to the local ER where they spent an hour scrubbing the road out of my face, arms and shoulder. So what tips and tricks do you folks have for recovering quickly (and without scarring) from road rash? 

Like somone else has said (I can't comment yet so I have to post as a new response) a common practice to loosen stiff links is to wiggle the chain back and forth around the stiff link, as shown with the red arrows. Also, putting some Triflow on the pin before you drive it back in will happy in the future. Really you should be using new chain pins or powerlinks. 

I got a Niterider Lumina 700 for about $100 on Amazon. It's plenty bright for commuting (most of the time I don't even use the high setting) on unlit roads, it throws a pretty wide beam, and the light is very white. It's rechargeable through USB which is awesome, so I charge it up at work when I see the indication that it's getting low. 

It depends on the type of hub, but most commonly you'll need a 15mm and 17mm cone wrench. A picture of the hub would be helpful. 

Another important criteria is where the climb is placed. If you put an otherwise cat 1 climb at the end of a mountain stage with an uphill finish, it becomes an HC climb. 

Others have done a good job on the pedals; I'll focus on the shoes. I like riding with mountain biking shoes since you can walk around easily with them. You never know when you'll need to walk around; today at work work I wound up using them all day long because I forgot I brought my shoes home the other day while driving. That would have totally sucked if I had been using my road shoes. Spend a bit of time in an empty parking lot getting used to clipping in and out. Twisting your foot is really pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it. I ride the Shimano SH-M086L shoes: 

I have over 2000 miles on this combination this year alone and love it. Bought them both at Performance Bike and spent < $100 total. 

Just a note about tire width, UCI use to allow 35mm width tires, they recently (in the last few years) decreased that to 33mm. Odds are this won't have any influence on the races you are doing, but 34mm use to be a very popular cross size for racing. Now there are leftover 34mm cross tires on sale lots of places because they can't be used in UCI races. 

What I think you are saying is there is dead slack in the cable when you pull the brake lever. If this is the case, you could be correct about the issue being with the cable itself. You can try putting Triflow (or some other light lube) into the housing by having it run down the cable, this will make any cable assembly feel better. Another source of the issue could be the caliper itself. Try putting some Triflow (or other light lube) on the pivot points of the caliber and work the caliper through its range of motion with your hands. THIS IS WHAT SOLVED THE SAME PROBLEM ON MY ULTEGRA CALIPER
