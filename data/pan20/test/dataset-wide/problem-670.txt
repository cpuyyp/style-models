and so on..... Even adding weight to a wheel rim in order to improve aerodynamics is a good trade off. However don't get sucked into thinking that the performance improvement will turn you into a racing star. The performance improvement is incremental, not revolutionary, and other factors are important when training or rolling around town. While reducing a wheel rim's mass does give you very slight advantage during accelerations (it has no impact on steady state riding), improving the wheel's aerodynamics is by far more important. A heavier but more aero wheel will still accelerate faster (or require less power to accelerate at the same rate), and it will attain higher speeds (or require less power to sustain any given speed). This is also true even when climbing, except when the climb gets very steep (how steep depends on your individual power, mass and aero properties). Here is a blog post with more detailed example of the small impact to performance of adding mass to your wheel's rims, and how that extra mass is worth it if it results in better aerodynamics, even for the hardest acceleration scenario there is on a bike, a standing start: The sum of the parts II 

It's fairly simple; to stop effectively, you need to apply the two controls in a different manner. When you start braking, you have a given amount of weight on the front and rear wheels. As you apply the brakes, the deceleration shifts weight from the rear wheels to the front wheels, which gives more traction at the front, and less traction at the rear. More traction at the front means that you can apply the brakes more there, less traction at the rear means that you need to reduce the power on the rear brake. When I used to teach motorcycle safety, we would say "progressive squeeze on the front brake, light to lighter pressure on the rear". 

Genetics Amount of training Type of training (if you train only for long periods, your ability to work hard at a high intensity will be low, for example). Recent training history (if you've trained a lot, you will have accumulated fatigue) Recent stress history Recent health or sickness Current mental state 

Tubular tires are very common in cyclecross; their construction and the way they mount to the rim make it possible to run a lower tire pressure. 

One should check local laws as well, as it is illegal to motor pace on many public roads. I would never contemplate taking a group for a motor pace run. That's just looking for an accident. A good derny driver is like gold and they are rare. 

Yes, typically you will obtain an improvement in speed by adding clip-on aero bars to your bike. How much extra speed is dependent on many variables though (mostly how it changes your aerodynamics) but a couple of km/h faster is certainly possible. One of the several compromises of adding aero bars to a road bike versus having a dedicated time trial bike is that the clip-on bars are set up fairly high when clamped onto the tops of the road bike bars. They also take up space where you might wish to rest your hands at times and of course unlike a TT bike you need to move hand position to access gear shifters. It's not a big deal if the road is of a very consistent gradient, but will become a bit of a pain if the road is a little more variable. Another factor to consider with such bars is how they affect your saddle position as sometimes it helps to bring the saddle forward a little when stretched out more on bar extensions. Be careful with the clamps and be sure not to over tighten and damage the handlebars, but also don't have them too loose so that they slip when you are riding / go over bumps! If you do try them then take some time to practice riding with them and stay safe! Edit: Since the OP wants some specifics, I'll provide an example. I did some analysis of my own TT performance over a course I raced twice in 2009. It turns out the wind and air density were very similar on both days which meant a direct comparison was reasonably possible. I use various analysis methods to account for variations in environmental conditions, power output and pacing (some of which are derivatives of original work of R. Chung). The first race I rode on my standard road race bike, the second on a borrowed TT bike and using the same clothing and helmet for each ride. I accounted for differences in pacing and power (only 1W difference) and calculated the difference in coefficient of drag area (CdA) which is the primary measure of an object's "aeroness". My CdA reduced from 0.334m^2 on the road bike to 0.286m^2 on the borrowed TT bike, a 14% reduction. Now a 14% reduction in CdA does not mean a 14% improvement in speed. In this case it meant an improvement of 3% in speed or a little over 1km/h. Keep in mind that this wasn't a totally flat course, so on flat ground that would equate to a speed gain of ~1.9km/h. Had I simply added TT bars to my road bike, the speed gains on flat road would have been less. Here is the link detailing the impromptu assessment and data: $URL$ Now these things are individual, so YMMV, and what sort of speed gain is possible for anyone depends a lot on the aero characteristics of the starting position, the ending position and what if any power change is experienced when riding with the TT bars (often riders experience a loss of power when riding in a more aggressively tucked or stretched out position). Further edit: Here's some more sample data, this time showing the difference in CdA for four continental professional riders between their road bike (hands in the drops) and their TT bike. Again it's not clip on aero bars, however it's a good example of the variance in aero improvement between riders when position changes from road position to TT position: 

You might consider working on your cadence range; if you are able to spin up to 120-130 RPM, you will have a larger range and won't need to shift as often. One-legged drills and pure cadence drills can work well for this. 

Well, the simple answer is that aerobars aren't very helpful unless you are riding at reasonable speed (say, >18MPH or so), but most people who ride at that speed would prefer to ride in a paceline, which gives more benefit than aerobars. Aerobars are unsafe in pacelines because riders cannot maneuver as well as being on the drop bars. 

Is the cleat tight on the shoe? If it can rotate at all, you won't be able to clip out. Are you rotating your foot outwards to unclip? When I first got my clipless I tried to rotate in, and that doesn't work too well. 

For a given person at a given point in time, it is possible to determine what you are asking experimentally; for example, a runner can, over time, figure out their speed for different time periods. 

Just to add another reference / data point, this image is from an aerodynamics course presentation by Bert Blocken of Eindhoven University of Technology. In it he references wind tunnel test results of a rider in three different positions and provides data for the bike + rider, and the rider alone: 

Now keep in mind these are averages for the samples used in each study and individual variation exists, so the impact to any individual will be in this range but could be more or less. The physics impact Now of course from a performance perspective, you lose power output as altitude increases, however there is a performance gain as the lower air density means you can travel at a higher speed for the same power output (and aerodynamics). The physics is fairly straightforward and unlike the physiological impact it applies equally to everyone. As an example I examined the influence of altitude on the physics of cyclingâ€™s world hour record, and showed how the reduction in air density as altitude increases means one can travel faster for the same power output, or put another way, the power demand reduces at any given speed as altitude increases. That resulted in this chart, which shows the relationship in power to aerodynamic drag ratio (W/m^2) and altitude for speeds ranging from 47km/h up to Chris Boardman's 56.375km/h record. 

You don't mention where you get your calories burn/hour rate, but 800 cal/hour is a very fast ride. 800 cal/hour would be around 220 watts, and that's a lot for 6 hours. When you are riding, some of your energy is coming from carbohydrate metabolism, and some is coming from fat metabolism. The ratio between the two depends upon how hard you are riding, your personal fitness level, what kind of training you have done, and your genetics. If you are riding at your limit, you are burning a lot of carbs, if you are just spinning along, you aren't burning that many. On a 6-hour ride, a decent guess at your ratio is something like 75% fat / 25% carbs. You don't have to try to replace the fat when you ride since we all have stored fat, so you merely need to replace the carbs. If you were burning 800 cal/hour, that would mean that you would need to replace around 200 calories of carbs/hour. You don't need sugar to replace carbohydrates; any simple or complex carb will work, assuming that you tolerate it well. What somebody can tolerate depends a lot on their genetics and effort level; if you are riding hard, you might have to try a few things to find something that works. 

The optimisation of speed for a given course profile, environmental conditions and rider's physiological capability is a multi-variable optimisation problem. Factors include: 

When you properly consider all of these factors, and it's possible to quite effectively model them, then you'll realise the fastest times for a given distance on courses that begin and end at the same location will always be for flat routes with very low or no wind conditions. Alternatively you could just investigate time trial results from decades of competitions are see what sort of courses provide the fastest speeds. The fastest rides will inevitably be from flat courses with some form of reduction in air resistance, either due to traffic flowing in the same direction as the rider, and/or because they are at altitude. Hillier courses do not feature in the history books as providing the fastest speeds. Then of course the world hour record is set on a velodrome which is of course a short loop providing a never ending flat circuit. 

In this case the bicycle used in these tests had a separately measured CdA of 0.077m^2. For the positions and rider tested this represents approximately one-quarter to one-third of the total aerodynamic drag of the bike + rider. Obviously the relative proportion of aero drag for each of the bike and rider will vary depending on the rider's position, morphology, clothing and helmet choices, as well as the bicycle set up and equipment (frame, wheels, bars, cabling etc). Just looking at the images of the positions tested, that rider has quite some aerodynamics gains to be made with improved positioning, which will push the proportion of the bike's CdA to total CdA higher again. This is the study abstract (2010) for reference: $URL$ 

There are lots of different field tests approaches. I've been using the Carmichael one (two 9-minute full out TTs with a cooldown between them). 

You can work on a pedal stroke that applies pressure for a larger portion of the rotation of the pedals. That will reduce the peak force that is causing the wheel to lift. 

Hand-shift the bike onto a big cog on the rear by pressing on the derailleur as you spin the pedals. Tie the cable around the front cable stay on the downtube. Adjust as necessary to get the bike to hold a gear. 

Carbon fiber is strong. Really strong. The kinds of loads that your frame sees when you hit a pothole is far bigger than what you would get sitting on the bike. 

MTBR.com does a big review of lights every year; here is the one for 2015. They have a ton of useful information. 

You will not lose climbing strength if you work on your cadence; they are two different aspects of riding. My recommendation to increase cadence range is the following: 1) On a slight incline, choose a gear that is medium effort. 2) Over 30 seconds, increase your cadence until you are at your maximum smooth cadence (no bouncing). If your effort is too light, you need a higher gear; if it's too hard, you need a lower gear. 3) Hold for 30 seconds 4) Slow your cadence down for 30 seconds. Repeat three times. Do this once a week. This is primarily a neuromuscular exercise, so you don't need to do this too much. 

The power-speed curve of trainers are subject to variations during a ride and from ride to ride depending on various factors including: 

Workout quality is determined by the power output you can sustain through the course of your effort(s), and if the power is lower than it might be because of a lack of crank inertial load, then the training stimulus will be less. Keep in mind that the most important adaptations are metabolic, not neural. Changes to pedalling action has not been shown to convert to improved power output, except for the specific situation being trained. It's common for people to find riding on low inertia trainers (e.g. cheap magnetic resistance units) unable to generate the same power as when riding a high(er) inertia trainer. The crank inertial load doesn't need to be as high as that experienced in typical outdoor riding, just sufficient to avoid that awful draggy sensation. There are quite a number of published studies about varying crank length and chainring shape. The balance of evidence on these is that on average, such interventions neither harm nor enhance your sustainable or maximal power output. As a general rule of thumb, if you find using a trainer results in a power output 10+% less than you would ordinarily be capable of, then I'd suggest looking at making changes to your trainer set up. That may or may not include increasing the crank inertial load but often means paying attention to other factors such as having adequate cooling (very important) and use of motivational aids. 

The difference between 28 and 30 is only about 8%. If you climbed a hill at 70 RPM on a 28, you would only be riding at 75% on a 30, and your force would only go down a little bit. 

Your options to reduce the force on your knees are to reduce bike + rider weight or get lower gearing. If you have a standard road bike cassette, there are climbing cassettes that will reduce the gearing slightly (around 10% or so). Is it dangerous to your knees? Well, that depends on your personal physiology, how much force you are pushing, how much to you have trained for this, and how well your bike fits you. If you can do this without your knees hurting, you are probably fine. You might also consider standing up; this changes the mechanics a bit and mixes things up. When you stand up, make sure you slow down or you will spike your heart rate. Welcome to the steeps! 

I've run Rubino Pros for a few years. They aren't the lightest or fastest tire around, but they last very well and are pretty flat proof for my area (Seattle).
