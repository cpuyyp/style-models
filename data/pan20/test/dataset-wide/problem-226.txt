My mother knew she had a terminal prognosis and a projected lifespan measured in months if not weeks, but of course the question wasn't: 

Assuming the EMP from nuclear war doesn't fry all electronics (it won't unless specially designed EMP weapons were used) and you can cobble together power with solar or crank generation, radio is the best bet. Most people are dead so the survivors can go pick through everyone else's stuff. Even if only one in ten thousand homes housed an amateur radio enthusiast, they've got huge antennas so they're not hard to spot. Getting the power converted to 110AC is probably the biggest problem. The easiest thing would be cobbling together scavenged solar. Panels are plentiful but they generate dc, so you need a transformer and some know how. One cool idea I've seen is using a washing machine motor. You flip the wires on the motor, turn the drum into a water wheel (or hamster wheel) and it generates power. Keep in mind that radio is broadcast so anyone can listen in. And a mobile receiver can be used to triangulate the source of a transmission. 

yes you can have something like that. they are called superseasons We have them on Pluto. Also here. It's basically what you describe; you have seasons within seasons, like a "cold winter" and a "hot summer" etc. Both tilt and distance affect seasons on Pluto. I think it's going to be hard for you to have something like that for a planet in the goldilock zone; its orbit would have to be extremely elliptical (something unusual for an inner planet). But maybe you can have the same effect with a different solution. Change your planet into a moon! If your planet is a gas giant moon its axial tilt can cause the "miniseasons" that last maybe 1 month, and then either the distance from the star or the seasons (determined by the axial tilt) of the gas giant can be the "superseasons" 

I would say almost any animal. smaller animals are "less susceptible" to gravity changes since being smaller they have a lower volume/surface ratio, so with a 0.72 g they would barely notice. water dwelling animals would also barely notice since they live inside water where buoyancy almost negate their weight. bigger animals would indeed notice and with time they would be subject to some changes. However an adult elephant that weights 7000 Kg on Earth would be about 5000 Kg on Terra; not a very big difference. They are going to be ok. 

You could no more bootstrap an ecosystem by sending a vial of DNA than you could bootstrap a robotic civilization by sending a printout of the blueprints of a computer. You need something capable of creating life. Luckily life is really good at self-replication. A vial of bacteria might do the trick but you'd need to be sure of a hospitable environment (a planet in the goldilocks zone with liquid water, a magnetosphere and an atmosphere) and a lot could go wrong. Your fridge and your stove are basically bacteria killing machines and they operate on a scale dwarfed by the conditions of space. You might need to put some thought into the process but a single automated mission could probably bootstrap an ecosystem. This could be replicated on a vast number of planets. Of course Faster Than Light travel is impossible given our current understanding of physics, so visiting any of these places would be impossible, also it would take thousands of years for the missions to get where they're going and billions of years to bootstrap interesting ecosystems so I'm not sure what's in it for you. 

(the map is here to show just how much 'borderland' you'd have to defend with a country the size of France circe 1740) Now the neighbouring kings are starting to take notice of this upstart. After all, he was just a warlord before, now he controls a country! Spain and Portugal to the south, Switzerland to the south-east, and some almost inconsequential lands to the north-east (who cares about them anyway?!) Here's where things start to get dicey. Because other countries (other kings) have taken notice, they will decide they don't like you on principle alone. After all, how can a mere warlord dare think he can just invade their sovereign state! Let's not even get started on the mentality of the age about only nobility being allowed to reign as king. So you have enemies on all sides (trying to conquer the world will do that to you), and you don't even know yet what the other countries further away think (your telepath isn't onmipotent, after all). Let's say you decide you want to take out Spain and Portugal first -- it removes the plausible enemies to the south. So you send your telepath down with a sizable army, but Spain decides to send word via the sea route to Sicily (the king has a cousin there), and the Papal State of Rome (you know, the funny guys with hats that can deny you Divine providence if you don't ask for their permission to invade Spain first?) Now word gets out that your telepath is down south, so England and Switzerland decide they don't want to be next and start a preemptive attack. After all, what kind of warlord-turned-king doesn't tell his army what the grand scheme is? The trope of the evil mastermind telling his master plan is there for a reason, and it wasn't because of authors and playwrights. How long do you think one warlord can keep this up, if he relies only on the powers of his telepath? And how long before the enemies he creates decide that taking out said telepath is in their best interest? It's pretty much onbegonnen werk (an impossible task) to try take over a world that is filled with people just as ambitious as you are. 

This person is kinda of a show-off. He wants to build a nuclear weapon simply to impress everyone because he's a smartass. He means no harm, fissile and explosive components are replaced with inert materials so the contraption is completely safe. He just wants to show that he can do it. Can he do it? In the sense "Is it legal for someone to build a safe but possibly functioning atomic device in their backyard? What could be the consequences?" I expect him to receive some phone calls at the very least. (Asking for a friend of a friend) 

There's a person. This individual doesn't have and ID, or a birth certificate, nor any document of any kind. They are not recorded as ever being citizen of any country. They possess knowledge and wisdom as any adult but have no memory of their past. They may be able to perform a job but do not possess any degree or experience. What is the fastest way for them to get an ID in a modern country (first world)? Do they go for immigration? Or is it easier to forge one with the help of criminals? Does any of this differ if they are minor of age? 

If you look like a sex kitten I'll underestimate you giving you the chance to tear my throat out. If you're hot a lot of the blood rushes out of my thinking equipment into... other equipment. Rendering me stupid and predictable. If I'm looking at your tits I'm not looking at the point of your sword, allowing you to thrust said point though my eye. As I'm winding up for the killing strike I might take a moment to peek up your skirt granting you the half second you need to put an armored boot on my throat. (which is also kinda hot, by the way) Oh and I think the Kurds are sending women into combat because ISIS thinks if you get killed by a woman you don't go to whatever magical warrior heaven they all want. Don't quote me on that, I heard it on the internet. These are all stupid reasons though. You gotta cover up or people will poke holes in your skin. 

TL;DR. One person doesn't turn the tides of war. Not even a warlord and his telepath. I think we need to define 'the whole world' first. So let's assume we're talking about Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa (given this is the middle ages you're talking about). Then we need to assume the limitations of the telepath. Let's say she can pick up the thoughts of say ten people simultaneously within 50 km of her current location (and frankly I think I'm being generous here). Now, let's look at our Vlad's resources. I'll ignore initial numbers, because he could 'recruit' from acquired villages and cities as he goes. I'll assume his forces can produce enough food to sustain a healthy diet, given their high calorie output (they are soldiers fighting a war, after all). And I'll even assume his forces can procure enough resources to arm and armour his forces properly. In other words, my analysis will be based on an ideal state of affairs on Vlad's side. I feel it can be reasonably inferred that our warlord (heck, I like calling him Vlad now) can take over a country. Let's be fair and say he takes over... France (the French love conquering anyway). So Vlad starts his conquest in France. He's high king of the Gauls, and they are quite proud of it! 

The problem here is your use of the word soul. Nobody knows what it means to exist as a soul. We know what it means to exist as a body. That would certainly be ending. We also know what it means to exist as a mind. "I think therefore I am." Therefore if I am thinking I am. Can the scientist think while inside the machine? If not it would be meaningless to say he or she was in there. Are the components of the computer available for use? E.G. when transcoding the consciousness were provisions made so the consciousness could actively control the machinery of the computer? Can the consciousness see and hear and communicate, travel to other computers (if not it's locked into a perpetual hell of thinking but no outside stimulus. Given that computers are super fast the perceived time would greatly exceed real time)? You might be tempted to say they can't move around, but remember that copying digital data is trivial --again think of it as a mind transcoded to a computer rather than a soul. I think we're assuming that no provision has been made for a simulated life, so you've got whatever already exists on computers and that's it. There's no sensation of body, no simulation of emotion (though these are certainly possible they'd have to be set up ahead of time.) Basically all you get is interacting with the computer in all the ways that have already been set up. Maybe online gaming would still work about the same way, but it wouldn't be immersive. You'd simply see the game in third person just like a regular user. Would existing without a body be good or bad? Emotions are probably almost entirely chemically derived (again, you might be able to fake emotions inside a computer, but this alone could be the work of a lifetime of hardware and system design) so you might end up with a pure reasoning creature with memory of emotion but no real way to feel anymore. You might be terrified by the choices made out of pure reason. The person would be incapable of suffering though. The worst it could get would be the abstract thought. This sucks. And maybe the decision that existence has nothing to recommend it over not existence at which point the computer person quietly executed the command 

(above is a series of orbits. description is most similar to orbit D) The question is then, within these constraints, how do I figure out how long each 'season' is? And would the planet's speed be constant throughout its journey around the sun? EDIT: The parent star is exactly like our sun. Same age, size, and composition. The planet I am talking about has the same composition as Earth, and the same atmosphere. as for the orbit. I figure that the star is in the centre of Focal Point 1. With the closest approach being 0.49 AU and the furthest distance being 3.2 AU (if wikipedia is correct about our sun's Circumstellar Habitable Zone being between 0.5 and 3 AU. If not, please tell me and I'll correct this.) As for the planet, it has the same axial tilt as Earth, and the same wobble. Sorry if this is a bit boring to those that can do the actual math involved, but my focus is more on psychology, sociology, and biology. This is slightly above my paygrade. As a bonus question. How long would the surface be uninhabitable during the two closest approaches? Are we talking just the period the planet is in the 'too hot zone'? I could imagine it would become unbearably hot well outside the 'too hot zone', making the dual summers too much for the populous to bear. 

Is there a reliable and, at least, relatively safe way to keep a person unconscious for a period of at least a year(more would be better)? It doesn't really matter whether the individual is comatose or just "sleeping". I just need a way to keep a person unconscious for a year or more without causing any substantial physical damage to them. I'm not an expert so I don't know if using anesthetics for a long time is dangerous or how to avoid other issues like bedsore and stuff. 

Imagine a SupraWorld being built around a gas giant like Jupiter. To have a 1g gravity on the surface the resulting SupraWorld would have to be less than twice the radius of the giant (my calculation; could be wrong). I have unobtanium but it only provides impossible structural resistance and nothing else. My civilization will start by placing a large hexagonal flat surface (where the colonists live) with very large walls to prevent the atmosphere from escaping. More will come; eventually all the hexagons will join in a ring (the walls remove periodically as two hexes join) and eventually they will "close" as a sphere(the finished SupraWorld). How do I prevent the single "hexes" from falling into the planet? My idea was to have them at the top of a huge "tower", with the colony at one end and a large near vacuum spheroid or whatever at the other end, floating into the gas giant's metallic hydrogen ocean. Gyroscopes would stabilize the structure preventing it from flipping. How credible is that? 

Flash based ancestor Imagine that it's possible to encode someone's memories and personality and store them in a flash chip. Perhaps like the flash card of a camera. Initially this is invented as a way to prevent death. Everyone has a backup device installed when their craniums stop growing. It has tendrils reaching into the brain and is making a constant copy. Upon a person's death the flash card is removed and stored for safekeeping. After the first generation of this, perhaps someone makes a machine with two slots. One for the constant copy and a second for the companion. New generation rolls around, one of the stored flashcards is given to a youngster, youngster installs flashcard and has access to a lifetime of memory and experience. A second companion with limited duration could be enabled by hot swapping the companion chips. (remove the old chip, but don't flush it from working memory, load a new chip, share computing resources) This would naturally tax the computing equipment and would not be safe for extended periods. Machinery starts to overheat and can cause permanent failure of the equipment (I'm sure you'll want to throw some brain damage in there too just to keep things interesting). Ancestor to ancestor communication happens over a mesh wireless network. Two things are required here. Technology to store a memories and personality, the ability to then run that copy on a machine that can communicate with the natural-born personality. (All this could actually be feasible in a hundred years given the way technology is expanding) You are a hologram If you don't like the aesthetic of physical storage and tiny computers you could possibly use the notion that personality can be expressed as a holographic image atop the computing machinery we call the brain. The natural personality is strongly expressed, but a copy made of a dead ancestor could be overlaid overtop. It would be an light image like a photocopy, transparent and less forceful than the host, but overlaid atop same machinery as the host. A holographic reader could be used postmortem to capture the last state of a person who has died. Faint glimmers of the past companions might persist, but the copy of a copy would be faint. (otherwise you'd be getting persistent racial memory which is not what you asked for) Multiple imprints could possibly exist simultaneously but could lead to all sorts of problems (bleed-through, missing parts, strange and random mixtures of the personalities --up to you ;-) Genetic memory How does a hunting dog know how to point? How does a newborn foal stand up and walk? There must be some component of behavior which is informed by genetics. Imagine a brilliant geneticist unlocks this secret and expands it. Imagine further that he or she invents a way to read all memories into a form which can then be passed on to another. I'd want this to be a destructive process or it gets out of hand quickly (you drink a potion on your deathbed, it blasts through your brain turning it to goo, encoding memories and personality traits as it goes. Your essence ends up stored in a vial.) The mechanism for delivery would be challenging. Perhaps a specially tailored virus painstakingly designed to splice the new memories in without destroying the old. Not sure how you'd cram a second one in there temporarily.
