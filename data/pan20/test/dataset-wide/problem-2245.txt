I think part of what is missing in your question and the answer by flawr is core body temperature. When you first get cold your body automatically shunts blood away from the surface of your skin to decrease heat loss. As you get colder your core body temperature falls (you could think of it like the cold sinking in, but that is not literally true). When you stand next to the fire, your outer skin starts to warm, but your core temperature does not respond as quickly. Most of your nerves for temperature are in your skin, not in your muscles and insides. When your skin gets to a certain temperature, your body responds by pushing more blood to the surface, trying to keep you from overheating. You step away from the fire and your skin is still warm and flushed with blood, you will likely have increased heat loss until your blood vessels in your skin shunt the blood back to your core. In much the same way that a fire in a fireplace (as opposed to an airtight stove) can result in a net heat loss to the house, a short heating next to a hot fire on a cold day can result in a net heat loss to your body. There are of course many variables, but if you are feeling colder, you probably are. Edit Per request in comments I looked for research specific to the scenario I described. I have included several references to the basic principals of heat exchange related to blood at the skin level. I did not find anything specific to net heat loss OR gain from a short warming near the fire. I have experienced this perceived colder after a brief warming, and while I believe my hypothesis above is realistic, it seems to be untested under scientific conditions. References 

In the bellies of critters... Seriously, anything living in the area is going to know where the wild strawberries grow and will have made a habit of eating them when they get ripe. They grow close to the ground, so unlike black berries and other high bush berries, every critter can easily get to them birds, mice, etc. I used to frequent a grassy area with wild strawberries, and I probably saw 200+ green ones for every red one. It will only be by luck that you will get to them before the local wildlife. 

I would expect there is an inverse relationship between the train schedules reliability and alternative options for through the area. You need to be able to get to a point of safety, between your first awareness of the train and it reaching your position in the tunnel. Lastly, get a guide. Someone who is familiar with the tunnel will know where the safety points are. In the event of train entering the tunnel, they will know which one is the best option. 

Generators, fuel cells, solar panels and other power supplies tend to be sold with Watts as the energy value. Some of my electrical devices list amps, how do I convert amps to watts? 

There is canoe trail, in the interior lagoons of Presque Isle State Park PA. No gas engines are allowed, travel is bidirectional, like a bike path most travelers make a two way trip on the same path. While I was paddling there this summer, I noticed that the water plants a few feet under the surface all pointed in the same direction, indicating a current. This was consistent for multiple visits this summer. The current is nearly insignificant from a paddling perspective but it does impact the plant life. The canoe trail is indicated in the map below by a red line. As I recall the current was flowing from west to east (left to right). These lagoons are interconnected, on a peninsula, communicating with sheltered bays, inside of a sheltered bay. There are no elevated locations that might be the source of artesian wells. What causes the current in the interior lagoons of Presque Isle State Park PA? 

Assuming a quantity of dry fuel exist to build a fire, could I use a 'Flameless ration heater' to safely ignite a fire for cooking and heating? 

I didn't find exact number but the population seems to be more then 2 million birds with a life expectancy of 10 to 24 year that gives an average life span of 17 years or 6,205 days. 2 million birds divided by 6,205 days = 322 birds dying each day. It is not at all surprising that there is a dead Canadian goose on lake, in fact there are hundreds of new ones every day. 

My rule of thumb is, if you have to ask if something is still safe to use, the answer is always no. We all try to minimize risk and maximize cost/benefit. When I was younger and had less disposable income, my self answer to 'safe vs cost' questions was often more heavily weighted towards cost. You can make these decisions multiple times and save lots of money, but the cost of that one time that safety should have been more heavily weighted, far exceeds all the money you saved in the earlier choices. We each make and have to live with our own decisions. The follow-up question you need to ask yourself, is can I live with the cost of being wrong about this choice? 

Trees can be injured by trauma, same as a person. An occasional euphemism is to say someone died of lead poisoning when shot and this may be what is meant by phrase quoted in another answer "Few of these trees survive today, though. Historians say most literally died from lead poisoning." There is no doubt that lead in animal carcass is harmful for scavengers. (Not strongly related to points above but worthy of mention) 

I have noticed a few people are using blue light bulbs for the front porch and/or walk way. The light is not very bright and does not cast what I would call sufficient lighting. On some streets half the illuminated evening porch lights are blue. Why might people choose a blue light, to light outdoor areas in the evening? 

I found several references to using Vaseline in plumbing applications. Vaseline is brand name for Petroleum jelly it has been used and is FDA approved for health and skin use. Currently I think; In a high volume water system like home plumbing, either is fine. With Vaseline being less expensive it maybe preferred. Probably comes down to personal choice. In a low volume water system like a self contained RV water storage system. Either should be safe, but the Teflon seems to have a slight edge, making the higher cost worth while. 

Most products require 24-48 hours of dry time. Some also recommend multiple coats, with some time (i.e. 4 hours) between coats. 

Looking for a solutions to plug the existing drain hole without replacing the entire bailer unit. Preference is an easily removable plug but would consider one that requires tools to screw in and out. Size info I found this post about the DePersia Bailer Trouble is most of today’s plumbing fittings have tapered thread (NPT - \ / ) and the bailer is a straight thread 1-5/16 long, 7/8x14tpi ( | | ) – not a match. 

The most important thing above is training and experience. The best place to get that is volunteering with your local fire department or rescue organization. You don't say where you live, but if you are rural enough to go fishing, where the bypass road is a 5 hour trip, you should be rural enough that the majority of fire/rescue has available volunteer positions that will get you the training and experience you need to keep yourself and your friends alive when an emergency occurs. 

The two answers suggesting the purchase of gaiters seem like a great idea. The same effect can be gained with socks. Either cut the elastic off of a pair of socks that are worn out. Or just roll down the tops of long socks over the cuff of you boot/shoe. If you don't own or wear long socks, and you know someone who wears nylons, ask them to give you any old nylons with runs in them. You can cut them into gaiters of you own. 

Inverted Braille Heat the point of a nail or scribe and make small indentations in the thick plastic (lid?), using Braille characters. Color the indented dot with a permanent marker, as the mark is indented the marker will tend not to wear off. With a little practice you will be able to read them in the dark as well. Normally only a single letter will be required per spice. S for Salt P for Pepper 

From my experience fighting wildland fires, the number of clearing tools and the number of people in the group are usually the same. If you need more tools than you have people to operate, you need more people. Wildland fire fighting is mostly about building fire breaks (trails) faster then the fire is moving. Each tool has a place in the line, the person operating that tool may change but the tool, keeps its position (for the most part). In your example the machete would be first, the ax second. Some work is more exhausting then other work, so the person operating the tool may change, but the machete is always going to be making room for the ax operator to follow and have room to swing the ax.
