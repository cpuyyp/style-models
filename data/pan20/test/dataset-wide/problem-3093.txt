The absolutely excellent author is Fernan Braudel. I am afraid, I don't know about the quality of translation of his "Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Centuries", 3 vols. (1979) English translation by Siân Reynolds. The first volume is all about how they lived what ate, what put on, how and why travelled, and everything. This book was also translated to Russian. Sometimes you can find very interesting information on the thematical historical books. History of prostitition, of woman, of family and so on. 

For more than thousand of years the Middle Asia and some neighbouring regions got profits from the Silk Way from China to Europe. It worked practically until Vasco Da Gama. As for longevity of the source of free money, interesting people and ideas, I think, it was the record. As for gold/silver rushes, they brought inflation, too, and were not so useful. The industry appearing around them was scarce. Manaus cauchuc rush was, I think, the most sad case - when an industry appeared... and disappeared before eyes of one generation. The most radical example, with the greatest difference with and without the resource, I think, was Nauru - where the whole island/state was digged off. California was an interesting example, where one rush (gold) switched to another, more soft one (whales). 

It was well known that Himmler was not a thinker. "Himmler's brain is called Heydrich". In strategic matters he simply used the opinion of several officers of his staff. Before 1943 - that of Heydrich. I have read that Himmler considered the annihilation of three millions of Soviet captives at the first 4 months of the German-Sovied war as an error. Because most of them were ready to work and many to fight on the German side. Himmler was heartless, but pragmatic. And being not pragmatic he( or Heydrich at his shoulder), obviously, considered not German. That was his utmost "rebellion" against Hitler. He did annihilate them, but considered it as ineffective solution. So, it is absolutely unimportant what opinion did or did not have Himmler. He always only did what was ordered. He was a very good organizer and organized what was said to him. To work out some strategic opinion - you are welcome, he organized a good staff and expert groups. To waste millions of people? - you are welcome, he organized camps and staff them with people of other sort. It was important what Speer or Goering thought - for they argued with Hitler. Goering even said: "In Luftwaffe(Airforces) it is me who decides, who is Jew and who is not." Speer had sabotaged some Hitler's orders. Even opinion of some people in lower positions, such as Heydrich or even Guderian, had value, for they stood for their ideas and they proposed them. But Himmler or Goebbels simply silently did what was ordered or said or merely wished by Hitler. Some expert group in SS made some memorandum - why not? 

In 16th century Polish hussars were heavy cavalry, they were what knights became. In 17-18th centuries hussars were light cavalry. How and why did the change happen? Wiki mentions the change, but says nothing about the reasons. It was not that all cavalry became light. Notice, that both heavy and light cavalry continued to exist during all time of 16-19th centuries. But the Hussars and only they changed their armor, weapons and role so dramatically. And yes, the Hungarian hussars of 15th century were not heavy, but medium cavalry, but that was BEFORE the period mentioned. 

It is common knowledge that uphill attack for cavalry is a bad idea. As usual, the common knowledge is incorrect. According to Cavalry Operations In The Ancient Greek World, the uphill cavalry attack could be very effective. So, if the cavalry attacked, the Confederates would have done better. The other question is - was it really possible to send cavalry in attack? Would they obey to that order? 

There are two kinds of good generals: Tacticians and Strategists. McClellan was mediocre as the first, but really good as the second. He knew that merely saving the army is enough for winning the war. Maybe, he was not so genious as Kutuzov to win a war by a single maneuvre, but ... his target was not to be genious, but to win the war with the least losses, right? And his understanding of the fact made him the best. Really, there were no war or economic reason for the North for winning the war ASAP. It was the South who needed the fast actions. So, for soldiers it was enough not to be fools to like that general. Any non-suicidic soldier should simply love that general. We see here that the problem of the North was that it was not much democratic these times. And the profits of several polititians weighed more than interests of millions. And America as a whole had paid really crazily high price in lifes and hartred and divided country as a result. But somebody made his profit on that. It is interesting, how the history could turn if McClellan did what he was advised - took over the power in the North. Long and quiet war, with slow strangling of the South? Peaceful reconciliation with southern states voluntary returning back one after another? Peaceful and COMMON solution of the common problems after the war? It is interesting, how would the USA look out at the end of 19th Cent.? 

After the Mazdak revolution in Persia in 6th cent(with slogan: slaves, ground and women must belong to everybody), the population was practically annihilated, so Arabians came almost to the empty place later. After the 184—204 riot in China there remained about 7 out of 50 millions of population. After French revolutions of 1789-1871 the France became a country much more convinient to the simple people. And as for victims, there were not more than tens of thousands of them - incomparable to about 7 millions od the Russian revolution(with civil war), for example. According to the theory of ethnogenesis of Gumilev, ethnics have several kinds of turmoils. 

It happened in different countries and it was different, of course. In the Czech Republic there were four stages of gaining the former German estates. At start practically anyone could move in and claim a house or a farm, often throwing off or killing the previous owners. In more lucrative places that way was stopped by bureaucracy almost at once. On the contrary, many mountain villages were never populated and died off. All estates were counted, confiscated and sold off or given. As for real estates, they were given temporary. Later (from 46) they have got these estates as owners, not users. The speed of changes differed greatly - in some places they already got estates as owners, and in neighbouring places confiscation merely started. Taking estates from somebody else was very pleasant experience and sometimes it was repeated on the same plot or farm or factory. The next owner had better connections and thrown off the previous one. The documents and law ceased to mean anything. Administrative or military resource or personal arms meant much more. Sometimes even the President couldn't help. People, who, got these estates, could not correctly use them. They only misused them or sold off. Mostly these estates were destroyed. Of course, that socialistic behaviour helped greatly to the winning of Communists in the 1948 elections. The socialistic state, that appeared, at start used the German estate as a level for gaining influence. At the end, the estates were taken from them (not usual houses though) and joined in kolchoz or nationalized. Here you can read the thorough analysis about processes in one former German region.
