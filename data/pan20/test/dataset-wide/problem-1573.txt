Do a little thought experiment. Imagine you're a virus wanting to infect as many people as possible. Your victims will also become horribly disfigured, ill, and probably die as a result of being infected. Would you want your victims to become contagious before or after they become symptomatic? That's how evolution works :) It's also why e.g. Ebola doesn't spread very far geographically. Victims tend to get so seriously ill so rapidly after infection they have little time to infect enough others and to travel widely. Most infections therefore will be in the immediate vicinity of the initial victim, often his or her caregivers who may get infected by accidents or carelessness while handling the victim or his remains. HIV otoh has a very long period during which the carrier is contagious but not symptomatic, which has allowed it to spread worldwide over a relatively short period of time despite having an infection vector which makes it harder for it to actually infect another victim (direct blood contact is required, rather than merely being for example coughed on). 

Of course other materials may be used to try to fool people into believing they're holding a diamond. Wikipedia mentions that 

From these, it looks to me like risk factors exist indeed but the number of serious complications has dropped over the years and can be further reduced through careful screening of patients and the use of qualified staff (both of which may not always happen under economic pressure). As the same factors are mentioned seemingly independently by many sources (including practioners) we can assume that they're at least viable risks (even if for each the risk may be very low). 

The benefits of methadone (and similar) being handed out to heroine addicts is that those addicts may now stop buying heroine, reducing both their own need to commit crimes to feed their addiction and the potential market for heroin dealers (thus possibly removing those from the streets as well). Even were it just as bad for the addict as is heroine medically, the public safety implications alone would be worth it, the financial benefits from reduced crime are a major bonus too (and the initial reason the methadone programs were started in Europe). Being medically controlled however, methadone is also less likely to be taken in overdose or polluted form, thus reducing medical risk for the addict (of course some of them might still use heroine or other drugs on the side unless the methadone is given in a clinical setting with the addict as an in-patient with no possible access to other sources of drugs). 

Ergo, I can only conclude that there is no reason to assume that having open cans in the fridge as storage containers would cause any adverse effects on your health, as long as the same precautions are taken as with any other food container. Any effects that might ensue would be no different from having the sealed can in there.

Lead crystal products have been used to hold liquids for thousands of years. The "safety" rules listed at the bottom make some sense, as they would prevent the liquid from sitting inside the lead container for prolonged periods, thus minimising any lead leeching into the liquid from the crystal. Whether they are necessary to prevent dangerous exposure is another question, but I doubt it (unless you're going to have that brandy sitting in that decanter for several years before serving it, maybe, in which case I'd indeed replace it with coloured water for show and only put in the actual brandy shortly before the guests arrive you're going to serve). Do keep in mind that the "safe exposure levels" published by agencies like the FDA are orders of magnitude lower (and deliberately so) than actual dangerous levels. So even if they have a limit of 15 micrograms per liter, you would not see ill effects in all but the most vulnerable until you reach probably several milligrams per liter, a dose at which point the drink would have a distinct metalic taste and you'd throw it away because it tasted so bad after just a sip, a dose also that's extremely unlikely to ever be reached from a lead crystal container in normal use. 

That said, it seems logical to assume that having a worn out shoe with damaged support structures and sole will yield to a higher chance of injury than a fresh one (IF they were properly fitted in the first place of course). 

Certainly during the initial years the rate of problems (leading to deterioration of the patient or at least lack of success) was high. But from what I've hear it's improved over time. $URL$ mentions similar problem rates for various complications of 10-20% (with references to printed studies). $URL$ otoh mentions only half a percent failure rate, which is either far more recent, doesn't include all things the other article includes, or both. $URL$ lists, without sources or risk factors, the complications that can occur. $URL$ mentions 41.5% of patients in one study had trouble driving after LASIK (but doesn't tell whether the respondents were competent drivers before :) ). Here's a surgeon performing the procedure talking about his own experience as a practitioner (on his website where he sells it): $URL$ mentions the risks, but no percentages. 

Of course this doesn't cover artificial diamonds per se, which I think you're referring to. Those can indeed have different properties from "real" diamonds $URL$ 

is typical of the types of things that get mentioned (without the actual massive doses required of course) in popular press to "show" that things are dangerous. If you need to feed a mouse 11.500 teaspoons of Splenda a day to create a condition that might lead to cancer, the amount for humans would be millions of teaspoons a day. Even the worst sweettooth isn't going to eat that much of the stuff :) 

In the past lead solder was used to seal the cans, which did lead to poisoning as lead of course is rather toxic (which was not well understood at the time): 

(If the former Soviet Union really had banned microwave ovens in 1976, Western propagandists would have discussed the matter endlessly in the 1980s and late 1970s. They didn't. Similarly, Soviet propagandists would have scored the U.S. for promoting a dangerous device. They didn't.) $URL$ asserts that the claim may related to the fact that microwave ovens were simply not available in the USSR for economic reasons, turned by conspiracy theorists into a non-existent ban. 

Apart from the mumbo jumbo, any sap flow during or right before harvesting the trees would have no effect on the instrument once completed. It'd have to be decades of that different sap flow to have any influence on the structure of the wood. Sap flows only directly under the bark the wood used in instrument construction is wood from beneath that layer. $URL$ see here for how a tree trunk is laid out internally, including where the sap actually flows. It's only a very thin layer right under the bark. Here's Bob Taylor (Taylor guitars, one of the best) talking about wood: $URL$ Notice in the first video that the wood as delivered to the factory has the bark stripped already, thus the area where the sap would flow most is gone. $URL$ Remember though that to make a guitar the wood has to be dry, all the saps are effectively removed over a period of time before the wood is cut (and then again, usually, after it's roughly cut and before the final milling to ensure the final piece isn't going to warp. So even if the sap flow we in any way affecting the tree during the full moon and if that sap were present in the wood that's used to make a guitar (rather than in the capilaries just under the bark), that sap would not be present in the finished instrument except a small amount in the form of resins left over after the sap dries out.
