This one is interesting. You need to genuinely answer the question, "why do I care?" Is overhearing the conversation a waste of your subordinates time? Then tell Joe you'd like to move this conversation to a different place to avoid wasting their time. Is overhearing the conversation going to confuse your subordinates? Then definitely tell him you'd like to move the conversation to avoid confusion. Are you worried that others will get the wrong idea about you? Try to relax and realize you can't control other people's feelings toward you. Maybe he's wrong. Maybe he's right and you should change. Maybe he's right but changing would be too costly at this point. Learn what you can. 

and of course you've realized that sometimes that "passion" plays out in unproductive ways. I understand why the scenarios you've given feel like personal attacks, but in many of these cases the solution is to not engage. Make this your mantra: Discussion is healthy, spreading knowledge is great, but you don't owe Joe an explanation. 

As many others have said, no one will care whether you eat the company's catered lunch or bring your own lunch from home. But there's more to it than that. Based on your statements: 

There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. It depends on you, and it depends on the company culture. Don't muddy the issue with talking about macronutrients, or almost-vegetarianism, or food morals, or bringing your lunch from home sometimes--no one is going to have issues or questions about that. Figure out what the company's expectations are, decide how often you'll want to leave, decide how important your lunchtime breaks are, and try to gauge whether you and the company will be a good fit. 

Assuming you are still interested in the position, then I think you should email the manager, but not to say "thank you" for preparing to speak with you. Instead, you should email him/her and say that you are sorry that you didn't get a chance to talk to him/her during the phone interview. Express your interest in the position, and make an offer to set up another phone interview with him. As the hiring manager, he/she would surely like to get to know a person who will potentially join his/her team. Obviously he/she will find out about you by speaking to the person who conducted the phone interview, but nothing beats talking to you directly. I think offering to speak with him/her in another phone interview will impress him/her with your initiative and indicate that you really are interested in the position. 

I've never heard of this situation before. Since you will be rescinding your acceptance, it wouldn't hurt for you to ask them for the reason, but you may not receive a truthful answer. The only thing I can think of is that right after giving you the offer, the company found another candidate for the position who indicated they would accept a salary 10% lower than yours. The company decided to lower your offer by 10%, knowing that if you decline, then they will just hire the other person. Whether or not it's ethical, be grateful that they decided to reduce your salary before you quit your current job. Imagine how you would feel if you quit your current job, got settled in with this company, and then they gave you a pay cut. 

Joe is expressing his frustration that he won't have the deliverable. Maybe he's even correct. Maybe the head of the company made a dumb decision. But if Joe is owed an explanation, it won't come from you; it will come from the company head. 

It sounds like you're in proximity to a somewhat toxic situation, you're pretty low on the totem pole, and your boss(es) don't particularly care about this problem. You also say you don't want drama. How can I distance myself from these people while maintaining professionalism? You don't have to. Your other coworkers aren't going to automatically lump you in with the clique. They probably already know all about the obnoxious behavior. As long as you don't join in their conversations or go to lunch with them, they won't see you as part of that subculture. Even if, you started associating with them throughout some portion of your first 5 months but have since stopped, your adult, professional coworkers won't hold it against you. They understand that you were still figuring things out. You don't have to give anyone an obvious cold shoulder nor any other elaborate theatrics. If a clique member sends you a nasty IM or makes a rude comment, simply respond noncommittally and don't pursue the conversation further. The clique members will stop making overtures, meanwhile no one who's watching will care. 

It's your boss's job to decide what priorities are and when to cut losses. Sometimes the right thing to do is to discard completed work and shift directions. You might gently conclude that you either have a performance problem (too much waste due to thrashing requirements) or a communication/morale problem (the in-the-trenches programmers don't understand why their effort is being wasted/ignored). 

Be soft on the person, but hard on the issue. It's always a good idea to treat him as kindly as you would treat somebody you don't know at all. And it seems you are not so familiar with him to call him a friend, so there seems no place for complete honesty. So confirming to him that you trust in your team that his concern will not get swept under the rug seems like a good idea. Avoid any impression that you will take care of the matter personally, beyond checking that his ticket will be scheduled correctly. If you offer any priviledges, you might raise in him the suspicion that other people get elevated privileges too, which eventually could escalate the situation. After all, let's not forget that this is all well on the way towards a corrupt transaction. Maybe he's trying to trade personal relations or even coercion in exchange with privileges. People may try that because they don't understand that resources are limited. However they will usually understand pretty quickly when their own effort is futile and costs them more than they expect as a return. By staying friendly and professional you can also avoid any sign of you having figured out their unfair game, and keeps them from scheming intrigues, which people of that kind will sometimes do in response to disappointment. 

Let's suppose the following (which is why I prefer to work alone): the reason why you are putting emphasis on working alone is that you have made the experience that you are very talented in separating extensive tasks into smaller tasks the execution of which requires a minimum of information interchange between the sub-tasks. This would qualify you for a technical project management position because, contrary to what people think, the whole is not more than the sum of its parts. Having to distribute complicated work among several employees is always a challenging task in its own right. If you require people to communicate, they usually will - on average - communicate much less than you have expected them to, and even less than the task requires. But even if they communicate sufficiently, communication means doing more work than if only one person could do the whole job. So building a team is hard work and yet almost always impacts performance of the team compared to the sum of the performances of the individual employees. So if this is the reason why you prefer to work alone and if you probably would like to be assigned technical project management responsibility, then you could write something like 

Absolutely you should send in another application for the new job listing. It is perfectly normal for someone to send in multiple job applications to a company, if that company has multiple jobs that the person is interested in. There is nothing desperate about that. The hiring manager probably receives a lot of applications for each job listing, so he probably won't even remember that you applied for the previous position. You don't need to mention that you already applied for the other position. 

Employment applications can ask for a variety of things of interest to the company that wouldn't be on a resume. These can include the following: 

It's no problem to make your own business card. There are plenty of companies that don't even issue business cards for their full-time permanent employees. You need a way to give your contact information to people you meet at these seminars and events, and the business card is the easiest way to do so. I think it'd be a good idea to put your employer's name and your title on the business card, that way people know you're employed and that information could help them to remember who you were when they look at your card. You can also include your company's phone number and your work email address, but since you say you're a temporary employee, it'd be a better idea to include your personal phone number and email address. That way people can still contact you after you leave your current employer. EDIT: Your manager doesn't have a problem with you attending those events that he forwards to you (otherwise he wouldn't forward them to you), and it wouldn't hurt to ask him if the company can make some business cards for you since you would like to attend those events. Also you can have two sets of cards if you prefer (one business and one personal), but only give one of those cards to anyone you meet, otherwise they might be confused about how they should contact you.
