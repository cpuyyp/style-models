There's no certain answer to this question, as the various realizations of /r/ in OE/ME (and in early Germanic languages generally) are far from straightforwardly clear. A good recent article by Piotr Gąsiorowski, arguing that /r/ was already highly variable in OE, can be found here. 

Your question seems to assume that languages are the way they are because of conscious design by speakers. This isn't true -- speakers don't have the option to "make [the language] simpler" or "make it easier for learning". Sure, it's true that getting rid of irregular inflections like am-are-is would make English easier to learn, but no one's in a position to decree this. Kids learn the language as it exists, and deliberately changing your basic grammar as an adult is very hard. Languages aren't planned, they're the outcome of long, unconscious processes of evolution. This means that the answer to your "why" question has to be looked for in these historical processes (e.g. grammaticalization, as others have pointed out), rather than in the field of conscious human choices ("why bother", etc.). Consider also that, by definition, there's no language that's too hard to learn. (If there were, it wouldn't survive, at least not in that form.) The complexity of inflections and the like is difficult mainly for adult second-language learners, not for child first-language learners. The human mind is capable of astonishing feats of grammatical calculation: English inflections are a piece of cake compared with the morphology of many other languages (take a look at Georgian or Mohawk sometime!). And most (not all) of this complexity is informative, adding meanings (e.g. number, tense etc.) that could otherwise not be expressed as succinctly. So the question can be put the opposite way: given the highly developed human ability to manipulate complex morphology for informative purposes, why not use this capacity to its full potential? 

As jlawler says in his comment, what's really going on is that [s] has become [h] in certain positions. This is a pretty common type of sound change, which falls under the rubric of "debuccalization". Phonetically, what happens in this type of change is basically that the articulation becomes laxer, in that (in this case) the near-closure at the alveolar ridge which is needed to produce an [s] sound is no longer being made, and all that's left in a puff of air, i.e. [h]. That's the "how"; as for the "why", that's a more difficult question, as is usually the case in linguistics generally and with sound changes specifically. Seeing that this kind of change occurs fairly often in unrelated languages (see the Wiki page for a similar example from Ancient Greek), it seems to be simply an articulatory tendency that some languages show and others not -- why is anyone's guess. I'm no Romance historical linguist, but French influence doesn't seem impossible in this particular case: the French were colonizing the Caribbean at about the same time that they were losing syllable-final consonants, and if French [s]-loss went through an [h] stage, it's possible that that remained as a substrate influence in Caribbean Spanish. But you could imagine other language-contact scenarios, e.g. possible influence from indigenous languages that lacked an [s] sound. In any case, though, a language-contact explanation isn't really needed here, since this is a common enough type of change that it could have happened on its own without any outside influence. 

The sense "bind" gives a noun for a thing you bind with, i.e. a "thong" or "strap"; this in turn comes to mean "whip" because a whip and a thong are similar things; and on this is based a verb meaning "to whip". The prefix ex- in Latin doesn't always literally refer to "motion out" -- in some compounds, as presumably here, it can mean something like "thoroughly". 

Choice of tense, other than the perfect. Romance languages often use their imperfective past tense for narrative background and their perfective past tense (e.g. French passé composé or Spanish simple past) for narrative foreground. Suzanne Fleischmann wrote an excellent book about this. Main vs. subordinate clauses. There's a tendency for narrative foreground events to be expressed in main clauses, and for background material to be expressed in subordinate clauses. This isn't absolute, but it's a pretty strong correlation in many languages. 

Syllable-initial vowels are disallowed; all syllables must begin with a consonant. There is no glottal stop phoneme. 

How well-accepted are these conjectured borrowings? Are there other examples of proposed IE-to-Uralic loans with similarly basic meanings? If these really are loanwords, under what kind of sociolinguistic scenario could such borrowing have taken place, and is such a scenario (presumably involving a high degree of prolonged contact and intermixture) plausible or supported by any evidence? Alternatively, of course, some believe that IE and Uralic are genetically related, in which case these words could be cognates rather than borrowings. The IE-Uralic relationship is an open question, but accepting the possibility for the sake of argument, is there anything about these words that would rule out their being cognates (e.g. relative chronology)? 

Probably not, at least not provably so. Since Arabic and Germanic aren't related (certainly not at a time depth shallower than the development of agriculture), the words can't be cognate. Could one be a borrowing from the other? Well, English plough has no clear cognates outside of West Germanic, while Arabic falaḥa has cognates in other Semitic languages (e.g. Hebrew p-l-ḥ "to divide, cut asunder"). If there was borrowing, then, it would have to have been either from a Semitic language into West Germanic, or from a West Germanic language into Proto-Semitic. The latter is impossible because Proto-Semitic predates West Germanic by milennia. The former isn't strictly impossible, but these aren't language groups that are known ever to have been in contact, so it is unlikely. One could hypothesize that borrowing occurred through some intermediary language, but that would be highly conjectural and completely unprovable. 

Latin and Greek, just like English, are Indo-European languages: they're descended from an ancestor language called Proto-Indo-European (PIE), which we know relatively little about because it was spoken before the invention of writing. Many Latin and Greek words can be traced back to PIE, though others cannot (sometimes because they're borrowings from other languages, sometimes because their etymology is unknown). Of course, your question can be taken a step further back -- where did Proto-Indo-European come from? The answer to that is that, although many people have speculated, no one really knows, because there isn't enough evidence to work with. (Btw, many or most common English words do not come from Latin and Greek, but directly from Proto-Indo-European.)

Latin has a pretty large class of nouns like these, which are actually called abundantia in the grammatical tradition. They're second-declension nouns which occur as both masculine and neuter, with no difference in meaning. Examples: baculum/baculus 'staff', cingulum/cingulus 'belt', collum/collus 'neck', pileus/pileum 'cap', vallus/vallum 'palisade'. Additionally there are third-declension nouns with two different stems, with identical meanings, e.g. femur 'thigh', stem femor- or femin-; iecur 'liver', stem iecor- or iecinor-. Or the meanings can be slightly different: pecus, pecor- 'herd of cattle' vs. pecus, pecud- 'single head of cattle'. Ancient Greek also has some nouns with multiple stems, e.g. oneiros 'dream', stem oneiro- or oneirat-. 

This isn't an example of antonymy, but of accidental similarity. The Latin prefix sub- could be assimilated into sur- before an r. This is not the same as French sur 'over', which is from Latin super. 

There's a lot of variation. In my experience, many Indo-Europeanists will (try to) pronounce the voiced aspirates as breathy voiced consonants (possibly thanks to having studied Sanskrit, as jlawler points out). A bigger problem is the laryngeals, since the phonetic values of those are far from clear. Some people just pronounce them all as [h] and then specify "...with h₁" or whatever; others try to give each of them whatever phonetic value they think is likely. I've never heard anyone try to pronounce a distinction between the plain and palatalized velars. Those are the main trouble spots I can think of; vowels are easy because PIE had a small and simple vowel inventory (/a e i o u/ at most). ETA: as other users point out, some linguists see reconstructed forms as basically an algebraic shorthand for correspondence sets, and are reluctant to treat them as representing sounds with specific phonetic content. To some extent this issue is orthogonal to your question if what you're asking is "How do linguists pronounce PIE words when discussing them with other linguists?" rather than "How was PIE pronounced?", because whatever your views on the status of reconstructions, you still need a way of talking about the forms. (If what you're asking is "How was PIE pronounced?", that's a whole other question.) The Indo-Europeanists I've known mostly happen not to be of the purist school, so I don't know how purists approach this practical question. 

The loss of intervocalic s is one of the defining features of Proto-Greek: that is, it occurred before the earliest attested Greek and is common to all the Greek dialects. It is thought to have gone through an [h] stage, which seems to be attested in Mycenaean. Intervocalic [s]'s in Greek have several different sources, e.g.: 

I don't have a source for this at hand, but I would assume that the -anus suffix originated in a-stems: that is, the original suffix was -nus, but added to an a-stem it was -a-nus. This -anus would then have spread by analogy to nouns that aren't a-stems, too. This is a common type of process; for a close parallel cf. the Greek feminine suffix -ssa, which originally arose by the addition of *-ya to t- and k-stems (e.g. *melit-ya > melissa "bee", *Phoinik-ya > Phoinissa "Phoenician woman"), but then became productive with all kinds of nouns (e.g. basilissa "queen"). 

You're interpreting Gordon correctly: these masculines had two variants of the gen. sg. form. The same goes for i-stem masculines: see section 87 (p. 265), "Alternation between -ar and -s in the gen. sg. was due to partial assimilation to the a-stem declension." 

There's lots of work on the semantics of the English perfect constructions. A recentish (2002) paper by Kiparsky which could get you started is here. 

That said, Modern Hebrew syntax is very heavily affected by European languages, so it arguably doesn't count as a "non-European language". The fact that many European languages have this double function of if is, I think, due to areal diffusion rather than inheritance: Latin doesn't have this feature, but its Romance daughters do. 

There are many such languages. Examples include Turkic languages (as kiyoshigaang's answer mentions), Uralic languages (such as Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian), spoken Mandarin and Cantonese, and doubtless many others. Languages which lack grammatical gender generally will usually lack gendered third-person pronouns specifically (although there are exceptions to this, such as English). 

The Etruscans had several names in antiquity: the Greeks called them Tyrsenoi or Tyrrhenoi, the Roman Tusci or Etrusci (and their country Etruria). All these names seem to be related, ultimately coming from a root Turs- (or maybe Trus-). (The Etruscans themselves seem to have used a completely different name, Rasenna or Rasna.) Thus Turs- plus the Greek ethnonymic suffix -en- gives Tyrsenoi (or Tyrrhenoi with the regular change -rs- > -ss-). In Latin, Turs-ci would give Tusci. With metathesis, Turs- becomes Trus-, and this seems to underlie E-trus-ci and E-trur-ia (from E-trus-ia with regular rhotacism). But why the E- in these last two forms? Adding prothetic e- before a consonant cluster is, of course, something that many languages do, but Latin doesn't. Latin has no problem with words beginning tr-, so there's no reason to add an initial e-. The only hypothesis I can think of is that the Romans got this name through some other, unknown language which didn't allow initial consonant clusters, and the e- is due to that language. This is probably an unanswerable question, but has anyone speculated about this initial e-? 

As for /f/, it results from lenition of initial /p/; and likewise /h/ from initial /k/, but only before back vowels. Of course, these regular sound changes might themselves be ascribable to language contact in some way, since all the new sounds are ones that occur in neighboring Indo-European languages. 

(A superficially similar variant of 3 is grammatical: "I told you, eat that pizza!" - but here the imperative clause is not subordinate.) But there's no obvious reason why this should be so. Pragmatically, an imperative is usually paraphrasable by a declarative, e.g. "I order you to Verb" or "You must Verb", and such declaratives are subordinatable like any others. Indeed, Ancient Greek allows subordinate imperatives to a limited extent (examples from Smyth's Greek Grammar, p. 411): 

Enualios or Enyalius (Ἐνυάλιος) is, in Homer and other Greek authors, either an epithet of the war god Ares or else the name of a separate god, the son of Ares and brother or partner of Enyo (whose name seems to come from his). The name appears as early as Mycenaean, where it seems to refer to a separate god. What is the source of his name? Chantraine says "no etymology, probably pre-Greek", but the name looks like a well-formed Greek prepositional compound: en-ualios would be "the one in the hualos". This word ὕαλος has several meanings: it later comes to mean "glass", but earlier on seems to have referred to some kind of crystalline stone, possibly alabaster, but also possibly to amber; and Hesychius gives an additional gloss equating it with βόρβορος "mire, mud, filth". None of these gives a clear meaning for the name, though: "the one in the crystal/stone/amber/mire" are not particularly obvious names for a war god. Are there any good theories out there about the etymology of this name? 

There are in fact numerous Irish words beginning p-. These, as far as I can tell, are mostly loanwords. Why the p in these words but not in clann? Do the loanwords in p date from a later period, and if so when did Irish acquire a p and begin to retain p in loanwords? Why the specific change to c? Other than being voiceless stops, the two sounds are not particularly close; one might have expected the p to be lost completely, or maybe to be borrowed as b. A possible factor is that there are numerous cognate sets where Irish c corresponds to Welsh p (from PIE * kw), e.g. cethair : pedwar 'four'. If speakers were aware of these correspondences, this could explain the choice of p. Is there any evidence that this might have been the case?
