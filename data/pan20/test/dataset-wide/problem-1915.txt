You appear to be part of the "open concept" plus "collaborate constantly and vocally", that seems to be somewhat the fad these days. Since the manager already indicated that such "collaboration" is necessary, it appears that the programmers are mostly doing what they are expected to do. But not all knowledge workers like to collaborate so loudly, and it appears that all this noise doesn't work well for the marketing department. So your initial approach should not be to the programmers themselves, nor their manager. Instead, you should approach your manager, and explain how the noise makes it difficult for you in marketing to get your job done. This is a task best handled by upper management. They are in a position to balance the needs of the departments within the context of the physical layout. They may choose to move the programmers or move the marketers to more remote spots, erect sound barriers/cubicles, or come up with some other solution. Of course, they may also respond with "suck it up" (hopefully in more tactful words). If that's the case, you'll be faced with the typical solutions many of us attempt in noisy work environments - work at home more, use headphones, work different hours, occupy a conference room, etc. You could also choose to nicely ask the programmers if they could collaborate more quietly, or move their more boisterous and vocal collaborations into a conference room. It's a tough situation, but not at all unusual, as many companies these days have decided that "open concept" is the way to be. Whether their motivation is truly "collaboration" or "less expensive" is debatable. 

It's an interesting idea. I could see the gamification elements inherent in the Stackexchange model encouraging more employees to contribute questions and answers. But I'd worry about moderation. And I'd worry about popular-but-incorrect answers leading to lots of confusion. If you could get a stackexchange clone to use, it would certainly be worth a pilot project at least. (BTW - lots of other solutions allow for a Question and Answer format, and full-text search, if those are your main attributes of interest.) 

It would not hurt a candidate anywhere I have ever worked. For software engineers that I have hired, a CS degree at any level would be sufficient. Holding an additional unrelated degree would in no way detract from that. Clearly there are many other job requirements and usually relevant experience is high on the list. But a Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering would not be a negative for me as a hiring manager. 

Maybe. Probably more of a chance that your prior experience isn't relevant enough to elevate you beyond entry-level status. 

There are other approaches, although I wouldn't recommend them. You could choose to take a passive-aggressive approach and spend the bulk of your time writing code, leaving no time for the process. Then complain "I don't have time" when you are inevitably asked to deal with process tasks. That would let you do the fun parts of your job for a while and avoid the tedious parts. Eventually, of course, it would catch up with you and result in lower performance appraisals and perhaps dismissal. You could choose to appeal to a higher authority and go over the head of your boss. Present your case as to why the new process should not apply to you to management. It's highly unlikely that upper management would agree that nobody else has your skills (or ever will) and thus the new process doesn't apply to you. Likely you will become labeled as high-maintenance or simply dismissed. It's possible you could conform for now and wait it out in the hopes that the new processes will eventually be deemed to cumbersome. That could take some time and might never happen. In the end we all need to decide if the processes required in our company are something we want to adhere to or not. And if not, it might be time to move on. In your case it sounds like you enjoyed the semi-cowboy life, don't like a heavy process-oriented shop, and might be better off finding a shop that is more suitable to your preferences. I can empathize with that feeling - I've been there and done that on more than one occasion. 

All sorts of companies in the US do this. Perhaps more startups than established companies, but some of both. It's common for software developers and other software engineering workers. Some companies offer equity to everyone. 

One definition of ultimatum is "a final demand or statement of terms, the rejection of which will result in retaliation or a breakdown in relations." There's no way to deliver an "If you don't... then I am going to leave" message that isn't an ultimatum. If you are serious, it is indeed an ultimatum (perhaps a friendly one). If you aren't serious, it's just an idle threat. You already asked for a transfer to a different team, and were told that it was in the works, but not imminent. If you can't wait, then you are right to seek another job. If you really think they don't understand the depth of your concern, and believe that your boss might hasten your transfer if he knew, then you need to be clearer in your communication. You could up the ante by saying something like "I understand this transfer will happen eventually. But this is really important to me, and I don't think I can wait that long." This is still a subtle ultimatum. Only you can decide if your boss will be amenable to further discussion, if you can wait until the promised transfer happens, or if this is a lost cause. For me, I wouldn't threaten to quit until I already had an offer in hand. Your mileage may vary. 

It might be different in the nursing profession, but in places where I have worked, it's pretty much a tossup when a woman takes a maternity leave if she will ever actually return. It's never a surprise when they don't. Usually, it's because the mother never actually planned to resume work after the leave was complete. But I know of one other occasion where the mother found a new job waiting for her after her maternity leave and thus never returned. I've also had people take a 1-month vacation (back to their home country), give a notice within their vacation time, then never return. Maternity leave, paternity leave, leave for other reasons - it happens. In the software world, while it might cause bad feelings, it wouldn't cause a blacklist. 

It's hard to say. Some companies and interviewers tend to be optimistic and might feel that they match all of your criteria, and thus would have a chance to earn your employment for a long term. Other companies would conclude that you have a laundry list of job requirements that wouldn't stay satisfied for long. But one question that will surely be asked - If you are very clear about what would get you to stick around, why haven't you picked such a company in your past four attempts? Four short term jobs in a row can come across as a pattern of someone who will never be satisfied for long. I understand your points about financial instability and toxic and dysfunctional work culture. But your points about expanding your skillset, taking on a major project, and more prestigious organization - those don't seem to match any of your "what it would take for me to stay" requirements at all. You need to be able to answer "Why will this time be any different than the past four?" I'm not sure your script does that. 

Yes, of course. I help friends write and format their resumes all the time. Nobody knows or cares who wrote or formatted your CV/resume. They only care that it accurately reflects you, your background, and your career. I can't imagine that an interviewer would ask about a nice resume. But if they did, saying "Well, I had a friend who is really good at it give me a hand." is a perfectly acceptable answer. 

I always have weekly one-on-one meetings with individuals on my team. I do this for new employees as well as for employees that have been around for many years. For me, it's a way to better connect with them individually, to make sure they are getting what they need to succeed, to hear what they want to say that isn't appropriate in a group setting, and to talk about how they are doing. For newer employees, my focus may be more on how they are acclimating, adjusting, and coming up to speed. But that's normal for someone new, and nothing to worry about. If one-on-ones are common in your company/department, then you certainly shouldn't be worried about yours. If one-on-ones are common for new employees in your company/department, then you certainly shouldn't be worried about yours. If one-on-ones are the exception, then don't worry. During your next one-on-one ask for feedback. You'll likely find you are worrying unnecessarily. Or, you'll find out what you need to do to stop worrying. 

So just meet tomorrow and discuss it with an open mind. You have your opinion that you can present. You also need to hear and understand your supervisor's opinion. Then, you need to go along with what your supervisor directs you to do. It's not important which language you will be much happier using. Your task here is to explain the benefits you see (productivity, sufficient security, etc) and then do your best to implement the task as you are required to do so. 

"Unacceptable" is for the company (CEO, owners, etc) to decide. There is no number or timeline at which it is absolutely necessary to have HR, if ever. But absent an HR person, you still need to find someone else you can confide in, to express whatever confidential concerns you might have, and see if any action is taken or not. In small companies, that might be your manager, or someone else in authority. Perhaps an office manager, or C-level executive or such. Check around. Ask friends and co-workers. There is almost always someone to talk to - even if they don't carry the term "HR" in their title.
