They would reject the idea (or at least the relevance of such an idea) that there are facts that are, in principle, unknowable. Talk of inaccessible Kantian "things-in-themselves", or the Nietzschean "True World" that is forever hidden behind the veil of phenomena is considered to be useless, merely idle chat. By contrast, utilitarianism is a moral philosophy. It holds that the utility of a particular action in providing the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure to sentient beings is both necessary and sufficient to establish its moral worth. It aims to measure the morality of an action, rather than merely assess its normative truth value. The conclusion of a utilitarian calculus is that the action is good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. Pragmatists do not render the same type of judgment; it is not meant to guide moral evaluation or moral decision-making. The line probably begins to blur as you get into neo-pragmatism, those contemporary thinkers whose work has been widely held to be "pragmatist", like Jürgen Habermas, Hilary Putnam (although, "pragmatically"-speaking, it's awfully hard to nail down what his position actually is), etc. Some of them have drawn moral conclusions from pragmatist rationale. But in general, the distinction is still one of a moral-ethical system, as compared to a normative truth-based system. 

That comes from an article entitled "Hume, Reid and Skepticism", written by Floyd Centore. The full cite, as best I can tell, is as follows: 

Is it possible to use empirical evidence to build a case that reincarnation really happens? (Note 1: This is separate from the question "can belief in reincarnation be justified in general?" See: Ought we only form beliefs based on sufficient empirical evidence?) (Note 2: This question was partially borrowed from a deleted Skeptics.SE question by njfife. My answer will be copied from there) 

None of these alternative explanations actually falsify the claim "The soul survives death, reincarnates sometimes on Earth, and retains at least some of its memories, and we can confirm this and rule out cold reading through carefully controlled interviews." They just tell us we haven't truly tested it yet. But alas, that tells us that we need additional auxiliary hypotheses which reduce the explanatory power of the survival hypothesis so much that there's no particular reason to accept it as an explanation of Stevenson's data over any of the other hypotheses. In particular the living psi hypothesis would seem to cover any anomalous data that could possibly be claimed to support the survival hypothesis. So according to Michael Sudduth's book, the argument that "the soul survives death" necessarily has no explanatory power, regardless of the more specific data it is meant to analyze, or the specific test meant to prove or disprove it. There is no way to state it in a way that becomes scientifically valuable. Sudduth concludes that the survival hypothesis is not a scientific hypothesis, meaning that it can't be evaluated empirically. This is the problem with much of parapsychology: experiments may suggest to a reader that something weird is going on, but it's hard to turn "something weird" into a scientific hypothesis, especially when it's an anomaly that is not systematically reproducible and varies its nature widely between experiments. Such deficiencies reduce the explanatory power of any hypothesis significantly. 

Assuming time has the following characteristics? I don't really agree with any of the characteristics there. What does it mean to say the present is fictional? To me those characteristics are fairly characteristic of metaphysical assertions which transgress the boundaries of sense. I think the river analogy is the most common one. Wittgenstein had some great things to say in his Blue and Brown books about how the analogies people make with time cause a lot of the philosophical muddles people get into. When people see an analogy, they tend to ask questions that don't make sense. E.g. there is a certain analogy between time and a river. That is all well and good, but it runs into problems when people carry the analogy too far (like Augustine did with his puzzlement about time). If one imagines a log flowing down a river, while we stand on the bank, we can imagine saying the log is now downstream, now in front of us, now upstream. That kind of analogy is used to describe events in time. One can ask meaningfully "the log has gone away, I wonder where it is now". But to carry this idea over into the analogy with time is the misstep in thinking. It causes one to ask questions like " oh, I wonder where the past has gone, and whether it exists" 

What do you mean by "know" and "feel"? I'm sure you've happily used the word " know" in places where you weren't talking about things you were feeling directly. Do you doubt that your friend's feet are sore after a marathon, just because you can't feel their pain? It kind of sounds like the idea of sense-data to me that was popular around Russell's time. Like " I can't be sure that I am really looking at a football at the moment, but I can be sure that I am perceiving the sense data which looks like one" (like seeing these various colours in my visual field). Thus I should, to be correct, in future, say "I see the sense data of a car" instead of "I see a car". To me, it's just a useless change in notation, where the phrase " I see the sense data appearing to be X" will take on the role of " I see X". 

To me, it seems the professor's primary point was that her choice to break the law would put her family at "risk" or otherwise inconvenience them. Frankly, an Objectivist would not care about this, and would certainly not let it dictate their morality. Furthermore, an Objectivist would reject such a law as immoral. In "What is Capitalism?", Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, Ayn Rand writes (emphasis added): 

None of the answers you're going to get to this question will be satisfying. Nor will any of them be correct. I could tell you that "postmodernist" thought is generally characterized by a "rejection of objective Truth", and a strong suspicion towards "totalizing meta-narratives", but that probably wouldn't tell you very much. And it wouldn't be strictly accurate, either. I could tell you that it argues that many of the things which we take for granted are merely "social constructions", not merely figments of our imagination, but things that we as a society have indeed created for ourselves. I could say that it aims to expose and destroy oppressive systems of classification, particularly those that emphasize sharp divisions between groups—gender, race, culture, etc. But one of those things might give you the idea that it's somehow "pluralism", which is so completely wrong that I'm not even sure where to begin. The reality is that "postmodernism" is not something that you can define, at least not as applied to philosophy. There were hardly any notable philosophers who accepted the label of "post-modernist", and many of those who are often considered to be anchors of the tradition actually strictly rejected the label. Part of the problem, of course, is highlighted by Jon Ericson's answer: thinking that is typically associated with the "postmodern" camp seeks to reject things like labels and totalizing meta-narratives. They wouldn't be too keen on allying themselves with any particular camp, or labeling their unique brand of thought as "postmodernist". There is a notable tendency among these thinkers to resist the homogenization and categorization that such labeling implies. About the only thing you can accurately say about "postmodernism" is that it's characterized by a rejection of modernism, the pseudo-scientific mentality of progressive objectivity established in the Enlightenment. Truly, one could argue that without the Enlightenment and the resulting movement that has become known as "modernism", there could never be such thing as "post-modernism". But whether that's actually a useful definition or merely a linguistic tautology is debatable. And even if you accept that definition, a couple of problems still remain. First, it's extremely difficult to define something in terms of what it is not. Several notable "postmodernist" thinkers have taken up this very notion, albeit in quite different contexts. As merely one example, consider Jacques Lacan and his notion of the "lack". Second, several of those who are apparently "postmodernist" thinkers have actually accepted "modernist" notions to varying degrees. Jürgen Habermas in particular is very much a "modernist", and he doesn't even reject the notions of "universality" and "Truth" that seem to characterize the thought of most other "postmodernists". It's hard to say whether "postmodernity" actually seeks to replace modernity, to render it obsolete, or whether it merely allied with it, continuing and reinvigorating the modernist project. Many, many, many "postmodernist" scholars vehemently disagree with one another. Somehow, this camp has grown to contain post-Marxists, feminists, deconstructionists, anarchists, post-Freudian psychoanalysts, and everything else outside and in between. Many people use it as a label of denigration, or at least a nicer way of saying "those people", the "different" ones, the ones "we" don't agree with. You see this in an unfortunate amount of academic literature, and in an even more unfortunate amount of colloquial rhetoric. See, for example, Paul Hartman's "What is 'Postmodernism'?" or the infamous Postmodernism Generator (refresh repeatedly for a real thrill!). In a truly postmodern sense, its accuracy lies in its appalling inaccuracy. So yes, of course it has a fuzzy definition, and of course the Wikipedia article seems to characterize it in terms of what it is not. There's not much else that it can do. In fact, reading the Wikipedia article now, it strikes me as possibly one of the best attempts to clarify and define the movement that I've ever seen. And I've read a whole lot of so-called "postmodernist" literature. Beyond that, the paragraph you mention concluding that postmodernism has influenced many other cultural fields is an important one. "Postmodernism" is not limited in scope to philosophy. In fact, when applied to other disciplines, an even more complicated web begins to emerge. From architecture to art to music, and dozens of other disciplines in between, "postmodernism" takes on very important meanings. Wikipedia links to a host of articles on "postmodern x", where x represents some particular artistic discipline. Again, what most of them have in common is the rejection of "modernism" "Postmodernists" would tell you that you're really asking the wrong question. Rather than trying to put a label on their critical project, to attempt to unite and thereby destabilize it from without, you should join in on the project and become part of the movement. If "postmodernism" implies anything at all, it implies problematization, the refusal to tacitly accept anything as objectively true, as objectively real, as objectively valuable. That doesn't, of course, mean that it embraces skepticism. That doesn't mean that it necessarily rejects all notions of objective truth. But it does mean that the goal is to problematize everything, to attempt to see everything from a different light, to root out problems at their source, to emphasize connections that haven't been previously observed or noted, to engage in relations with other cultures, values, practices, and systems of thought. It's a critical project, one in which nothing is taken as absolute, including the idea that nothing is an absolute. 

In a certain sense you're right - you eventually have to resort to faith of a certain kind in something you can't prove. Although that's not limited to ethics, you could say that about any area. I don't think there is a good answer to the question in terms of rational reasons. Do you think intuition is good enough? I don't feel I need to have a rational reason to think I shouldn't kill, ie it's not just the threat of incarceration or the disapproval of others that stops me. It's just one of the things I don't do. Eventually you will reach rock bottom when trying to look for justifications 

I'm not saying any of these arguments are true - they obviously don't convince me - but it's the kind of thing you hear. Most people also bring up some version of " it's natural, therefore there's nothing wrong with it" which is obviously fallacious. 

It tastes really good. I can't deny that. A lot of people get so much enjoyment out of it, it's hard for them to imagine a life without it. They feel they'd be giving up too much enjoyment to stop. People think animals are not worthy of protection - ie they either do not have interests, or they pale in comparison to a human's interest in eating meat. Some people doubt animal minds even exist, or deny that they can legitimately suffer. People might decide to get free range meat, "ethically sourced", as they believe that that means the chicken/pig etc had a great life before being killed in an instant without suffering. They might feel that the deal an animal gets is fair - without the farmer, those animals would live a terrible life in the wild with predators preying on them all the time. The farmer can offer them guaranteed safety for a certain length of time, and then, when the time comes, stun them and kill them without them even realizing. 

Children like making up stories and sometimes hit on several real facts about other people through totally random chance. Children can access the memories of relatives of a deceased person through some unknown mechanism. (Living psi) Memories drift around in the ether at death and sometimes fall into other people's heads totally independent of the question of survival of the soul. (René Guénon's "psychic residues") Stevenson was systematically deceived by his interpreters, or for some other reason didn't see what he thought he saw. (Cartesian demon) Regardless of what country you're in, for some reason -- pursuit of fame, confirmation of community beliefs, etc. -- people have a strong inclination to fake reincarnation-like incidents. 

The term "conspiracy theory" was invented by Karl Popper as a way to describe Marxist theories of history as a collusion of the bourgeoise class against the working class. So, as far as I can tell, someone actually arguing after Popper would say Marxists are actually seeing the world in a similar way to people who claim that climate change is a hoax, vaccines are poisonous, historical world leaders are reptilian, etc. by placing the motives of large groups of people in an "open society" under suspicion. From my perspective, regardless of value judgments about conspiracy theory, the entire "hermeneutics of suspicion" fits the category. Nietzsche's historical thesis is largely a conspiracy theory about the nature of Christianity, and many popular writers have interpreted it as such. Alex Jones claiming that "there's a war on for your mind" is being very legitimately Freudian. However, when I went to read the academic literature on this, I found that this view is in a distinct minority. Placing, say, governments, doctors, or environmentalists under suspicion is considered a "conspiracy theory," but Marx, Nietzsche and Freud are not generally claimed to be "conspiracy theorists." There are only a few sources that make such a claim, and they appear to be on the fringes of academic philosophy. I was unable to find any critical literature examining the difference between the hermeneutics of suspicion and conspiracy theory. I would appreciate any book recommendations, no matter how heavy. 

The justification that an argument is true because it is "too strange to be made up" definitely sounds like an appeal to the credibility of the speaker. It sounds to me like you're saying "regardless of whether or not you think I'm a liar, I couldn't  have possibly  made this  one up!" It's not a particularly strong or convincing argument, mind you, but I think it is clearly an appeal to the ethos of the speaker rather than an appeal to the inherent logic of the argument or an attempt to invoke strong emotions on the part of the listener. 

No, humanism does not, in any way, necessitate relativism. They are completely different philosophies. In fact, I'm not sure that I can even imagine a way in which humanism would imply relativism. One thing to get straight at the outset is a definition of "humanism". There are at least two major ideologies that typically fall under the umbrella of humanism. First is secular humanism, which is probably the one you're thinking of when you talk about "humanism". Secular humanism tends to justify action in terms of human reason, ethics, and justice. And in doing so, it naturally denounces religious dogma, superstition, and other things that could be considered "pseudo-science". However, it does not prescribe a particular code or system of ethics, and many philosophers who fall into the "humanist" camp have strongly believed in universal moral standards, exactly the opposite of relativism. A few examples of such thinkers might be: Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. Certainly, secular humanism can be seen as incompatible with a strong religious faith, on which basis you may take objection to it, but it certainly is not incompatible with objectivism (with a little O), the idea that there is a universal system of ethics accessible to all. Another common branch of humanism is religious humanism, which actually attempts to integrate humanism with religious ideals. Religious humanism is fairly straight-forward: it places the focus on the human being, affirming the individual dignity and worth of all people, just like the name naïvely implies. Certainly this could be compatible with religious teachings. Søren Kierkegaard is a famous "Christian Existential Humanist". Beyond these two specific disciplines, you'll also see "humanism" applied generically to any philosophy that places the primary focus on human beings, as opposed to society at large or organized religion. But again, the idea that different cultures have different ideas about morality and ethical principles, and that those ideals are equally as valid as any other culture's ideals, is not implied by this line of thinking. Neither is the relativist tenant that there is no absolute truth or validity. In fact, a humanist could argue that human intuition, reason, and moral virtue are themselves absolute truths! 

This is a quote that is probably easily misunderstood. He goes quite in depth about this in the Blue and Brown books. Wittgenstein was trying to sort out the muddle he thought was present in the way people thought about thinking. He was trying to argue against essentialism when it comes to meaning. A lot of people previously were trying to identify the common essence to all the thinks we call "thoughts" or "thinking", or any other words for that matter (truth, justice and so on). Philosophers looking at writing might have said something like : "When I write, I deliberately put the pen on the page, I think about what to say, and then move my hand to write what I had thought of" Wittgenstein then moves to disagree that when you write you are always "thinking" in the way people assume. He says that there are many different things that could be happening when you write, depending on the situation. You could be signing your name, which doesn't involve any reflection, you could be writing a mathematic proof, where each line you think about in great depth. You could be hesitating while trying to sign a contract, you could be transcribing notes from a blackboard to a copy, you could simply start writing random words. There are a host of different things we call writing, and we forget about this when we assume there is this peculiar presence of a "thought" every time we write. This is partly what he is referring to in his comment - that many times when we write and speak, we do so instinctively, or we do so without picturing anything in our mind.
