In the mathematical theory of communication, which is an enterprise of engineering mostly electronic, noise reduction, detection and correction of errors, robustness (to use your word) under conditions of noise, all these are very important, maybe even the most important issue in the human designing of engineering artifacts (codes) to facilitate machine communication. But, for whatever reason, all that very important research, while discussed philosophically by intellectuals in an informal manner, never really had a discipline transfer to linguists. There is surely some research into confusion of phonemes and other phenomena within particular languages, but I don't know of much into comparing different languages. This sounds similar to comparisons of language length: the size of a text that has been translated into a number of languages, and which is the shortest and which the longest. There may well be succinct and, likewise, verbose human languages but the experiment to do so will be difficult because of the bias and artifice involved in both human composition of narratives and in the translation process. Average document length is actually one possible technical metric for comparing coding mechanisms so this is not just an analogy but also one very narrow example of what you are looking for. So to your first question, no, I don't think there is any established technical literature (or much of it) that experimentally compares spoken language and content transfer under noisy circumstances. I could easily be wrong; it's just that linguistics, despite being a natural science, is not as interested in experimental methods as say psychology. To your second question, very informally I would guess that it all depends on under what context you're comparing robustness. If you are comparing yelling but/sell commands in a noisy stock market environment, one could experimentally determine which language is more accurate, but still allow that there may actually be either 1) No significant difference, or 2) a statistically significant difference that in the long run has little substantial effect. I think there are too many social variables to account for before saying that one human language is more accurate under noise than another. 

DR & MRS VANDERTRAMP are verbs that deal with state, movement, and direction. They are also used intransitively (without a direct object; e.g., Je suis sorti., 'I went out.'). You can see the difference notably when you consider that if some of these same verbs are used transitively or ditransitively, then « être » is no longer the copula. Instead, those verbs then take « avoir » as their copula (e.g., J'ai sorti les poubelles, 'I took out the trash.'). Consider the following: 

If you look at Altaic languages (e.g., Korean, Japanese, etc.) you will find that they have highly developed semantic features that may possibly be applied. In Korean you can find features such as +/- action, +/- abstract, +/- count, etc. The list goes on in Altaic languages, so these may be a good place to look when considering different types of semantic features. In English, while we do not necessarily have as overt of a semantic feature bundle system, it is not entirely unheard of in the language. Consider the three transitive verbs 'sit' (e.g., The clock sits on the desk), 'lie' (e.g, The watch lies on the desk), 'stand'(e.g., The vase stands on the desk). The types of items which can 'sit' might be classified as -animate, +compact (or some designation of the sort). Consider bowls, telephones, etc. The types of items which can 'lie' might be classified as -animate, + flat. Consider sheets of paper, rulers, shirts, etc.. The types of items which can 'stand' might be classified as -animate, +tall. Consider chairs, tables, lamps, etc. The idea is that we refer semantically interpret these items in the same manner that we interpret phonological features, which is to say we do it more or less unconsciously. 

John McWhorter recently explained some. I'll add to that that here. English has a number of features that, while not absolutely unique to English, just rare in the world, the collection of them is unique to English: 

When studying a particular language, phonology is mostly all that matters. Comparison between languages brings out the phonetics. Catalan has one nasal phoneme (doesn't distinguish m,n, and ng, even though they are pronounced as such in different contexts). And English doesn't distinguish some things that make semantic differences in other languages. 

they found that there was one phoneme, F (the unvoiced labio-dental fricative) that was correlated with a cultural use of cultivating grain. Many cultures are hunter-gatherer, many others are pastoral and yet others stay in one place and grow crops. The hypothesis is that those cultures that grow crops have a certain way of cooking and eating grains and that somehow (I can't remember their details) that is conducive to having labiodentals where the other ways of cooking eating do not. Of course this was statistical and not strictly determinative. But there was some correlation (I don't know how strong). 

There is a common language learner question for English (both native and non-native speakers) to wonder what kind of subject-verb number agreement to have when a sentence is complex. For example, students always wonder which verb to have in the following: 

Despite the superficial analogies, both at the large scale descriptive level (languages tend to bunch together in a tree-like fashion) and at the very theoretical level ('information' transfer over a 'noisy' channel), the mechanisms of language change are radically different from speciation. 

But as figurative meanings don't even need phonetic changes to help them become figurative, I wonder if there are similar figurative uses of the word or phrase corresponding to 'literal' in other languages. Is there any evidence that the corresponding terms for 'literal' in non-English languages have similar figurative uses? 

First, mixed languages, pidgins, and creoles are all different things, so you should beware using the term "mixed language" as a synonym for pidgin or creole. The overarching term that would include all three of these terms and others is contact language. Now, the following from Baker and Mous (1994, p. 5) attempts to define a mixed language: "A very rough approximation is that a mixed language has its lexicon and grammar from different sources. On the basis of the lexicon one would classify such languages as belonging to one language family and on the basis of morphology, syntax, and general grammatical characteristics one would classify them as belonging to another language family." The above shows that mixed languages are a melange, but there is reference to parent languages, and it does not include those things which separate a creole from a mixed language. One such difference, according to Mark Seeba, is that mixed languages, unlike creoles, tend to retain the morphological complexity of their input languages (1997). From here on I discuss the main question at hand: do contact languages have families? The short answer is that it depends. Research can be used to say yes or no. The long answer follows below. I suppose that daughter languages are typically shown as being born from one parent language, as we might find with English stemming from a Germanic lineage, but even this seems overly simplistic when we consider arguments like Bailey and Maroldt's (1977) Middle English creole hypothesis, which argues that Middle English was a creole born from language contact (primarily Old English and Norman French, but with evident tertiary contact considered key to pidginisation/creolisation). Because creoles tend to be the result of contact between at least three languages (although we often only refer to the superstrate and substrate), the act of genealogical tracing becomes more difficult but not impossible or unheard of. For example, I have personally seen language genealogy trees linking Gullah and Black English to a parent African language (i.e., West African Pidgin English) based on various lexical and syntactic rules. I cannot cite the direct source at the moment, but I have seen it used in at least one book in actual tree form, derived into the same structure in my Sociolinguistics seminar, and often explained in expanded form by linguists like John Rickford, Russel Rickford, and Lisa Green. I have read similar accounts for Louisiana French Creole by Thomas Klingler and others. One could posit a very strong argument for the parentage of any given creole simply through research and writing. Personally, I am on the side that would consider a creole to be the daughter of multiple languages with roots tied to both lineages. For more information and a wonderful, easy read about pidgins, creoles, and other contact languages, refer to Mark Sebba's, "Contact Languages: Pidgins and Creoles." 

You could ask the same of any kind of agreement: plurality, case, etc. multiple language elements in an utterance that don't add any extra meaning. Grammatical gender is particularly outstanding because it seems so arbitrary. One explanation is that redundancy provides some error correction over the noisy speaking-hearing connection. 

There has been a recent popularization over the questionable use of the word 'literally' as an intensifier rather than as a marker of non-figurative, especially since it seems to be used non-literally by well-respected modern authors. There is a lot of evidence that it has been used non-literally literally for centuries. "Literal", in English, is primarily used to imply 'exactly as spoken/written' so that when something is said that sounds like hyperbole, it will be taken as truthful rather than exaggerated. But that situation also is semantically ambiguous in that things could seem truly exaggerated. And then, if one didn't know otherwise, the term 'literally' could be understood as an intensifier, and therefore taken in a non-literal manner. It seems to me that there is nothing special about 'literal' in English that it should be the only one to have such ambiguity leading to semantic drift. 

All languages are related: there's a limited inventory of phonological, lexical, and syntactic features of which any particular language has a subset. But that's surely not what you're asking. I suppose you're asking if there is some common cultural chain from long in the past that connects the two, closer than other language groups. A handful of pairs, some from different pairs of language, is a bit of cherry picking. You really need to show a systematic comparison. Like with much language history questions, we weren't there at the time so we have to use comparisons of current language to check. Phonology changes so much over the years that if two languages seem to share a small handful of words very closely it is most likely a matter of a recent borrowing. Even some very large over-arching parameters of a language, eg left vs right branching or pro-drop, can change between historically very near languages so that is not a good single measure of closeness. But there is the vague idea based on vague commonalities like general word formation and general sentence structure (called the Nostratic hypothesis) that seem to relate the European and 'Uralic' languages together (but not Bantu), and the Sino-Tibetan and American languages together. Very vaguely. So there are some very vague commonalities between IE and Semitic that are not exactly done for the most part in other language groups. What those vagaries are... well, sometimes Afro-Asiatic (including Semitic) is included and sometimes not. In the end, the hypothesis is not considered crazy exactly, just that the evidence for it is not overwhelmingly convincing to most linguists. That is, it's pretty controversial. All that said, there are a lot of latter day Semitic borrowings into IE languages via biblical scholarship on the one hand and the Ashkenazi Jewish diaspora in Europe on the other. In English, check out the American Heritage Dictionary appendix on Semitic Roots of English words. By 'a lot' is not even 1% of words, but the number is non-trivial.
