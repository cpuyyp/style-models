Your diet needs significantly more protein. Despite what you may think, it won't make you gain body fat. Quite the opposite actually. When body-builders/fitness models are cutting their body fat they tend to increase their protein and fat intake. 

People hold body fat in different proportions throughout their body. Weight is not a gauge of your aesthetics or overall level of fitness. Some body builders at your height weigh over 200 lbs but their body fat is incredibly low so they don't look fat. If your goal is to have a flat stomach and thin thighs, plain and simple you have to reduce your body fat percentage. You can't reduce body fat in one area and not others; the human body fat scales proportionally. This comes through consistent dieting for a long period of time and frequent exercise. The body's response to this is also different for each person. Some people can very easily loose body fat with minimal effort and some people have to work harder but it is never impossible. So in general don't get frustrated if you don't see results in three weeks. It usually takes about eight to really notice a significant difference. In reference to how long you have to exercise, that really depends on your health level and if it is even safe for you to engage in it. If you are in relatively average shape start with 30 minutes a day. Then as it gets easier through the weeks add more time or intensity (try working out harder). Keep changing your routine every few weeks (try running outside when you get bored of the machine or doing calisthenics if you can't get to a gym); your body will become accustomed to doing this type of exercise very quickly and your results will start to lag. Most importantly, challenge yourself. Your body won't change if it doesn't have a need to; create that need through your intensity and intervals of training. The main thing is diet, however. You can work out for 10 hours a day but if you aren't eating the right foods consistently every day, week after week then you won't see any change. Good Luck, Hope that helps and feel free to ask any questions. 

No movement is safe for everyone. Burpees are definitely a fantastic conditioning exercise for time for me, but they're definitely not a good choice for a mordbidly obese diabetic smoker who gets dizzy when they stand up from a chair. Does that mean they're not right for you? We don't know. That's a complicated question that relies on a large number of factors. We can only speak vaguely in the general case. Generally, low-skill movements using low to moderate load are ideal for conditioning work done for time. High-skill movements like barbell Olympic lifts should be avoided, particularly with high load. Less skilled variants like dumbbell versions of the Olympic lifts, done with moderate load, can sometimes be appropriate. More reliably appropriate movements include most basic bodyweight calisthenics, but not gymnastic movements. The basics never get old. So for me, and maybe for most people who aren't grossly unfit, I'd say burpees, push-ups, planks, situps, sprints, air squats, and other fundamentals are great choices. 

The goal is to get strong enough that lifting your girlfriend is not a near-maximal effort. If she weighs as much as you do then this is entirely reasonable. Get to a 5RM of 1.5xBW squat and 2xBW deadlift and carrying your girlfriend 10 yards won't be a considerable effort. In general, one should walk around able to do the things they want to do. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to warm up one's joints in the morning, so that you can enjoy full mobility throughout the day. This can be as complex as an hour of yoga practice or as simple as some arm circles, toe touches, and a squat. Personally I like Hindu push-ups, a 3rd-world squat, leg swings, and arm rotations. If you are stagnant (say, sitting or lying down) for a prolonged period of time during the day, it can help to repeat the morning's mobilization. 

I assume you are doing this to avoid strain on your wrists rather than to toughen up your hands for bare-knuckle boxing? One option is to use push up "bars" or "handles" instead of your knuckles. This would have the additional benefit of getting you another 4" or so off the floor and increasing your possible range of motion. You can probably get a pair for $20 or so (cheaper than a manicure). Alternatively, you could try holding something in each hand which is roughly the size of a bar, e.g., a magic marker, to get your nails out of your palm. Gloves are another option. 

I am wondering how effectively a stationary bicycle can be used at building lower-body strength vis-a-vis weight-based exercises like squats and lunges. For instance, if I put a stationary bicycle on a resistance setting of "15" (just a number, I understand that scales on different brands and models are different), I can't pedal it faster than 40 or 45 rpms or for longer than 3 or 4 minutes. When I am done, I can barely stand. Can I substitute this routine for a traditional set of squats? 

Try standing. Seriously. Ask your supervisor for an adjustable desk or for a tall desk and an adjustable chair, or rig a setup of your own. I work standing for at least an hour a day by putting my laptop on a bookcase. I also try to do non-computer work (e.g., reading papers, conference calls, etc.) standing up. I sit quite a bit as well, and often with suboptimal posture, but just a few hours of standing a day seems to counteract that fairly well. Your mileage may vary, but for me this works well. 

Pull-ups and chin-ups are simple, hard to mess up, and good for grip strength. If you can't do one pull-up but have access to an assisted pull-up machine, use that. Or as VPeric suggests below, just hang from the bar--this will train your grip. You can make the grip harder by doing pull-ups from a towel or a towel-wrapped bar. Deadlifts take more effort to learn, but are good for grip as well as overall strength. Berin's answer reminded me that farmer's walks are very productive: you take a heavy weight in each hand and see how far you can walk before you have to put it down. If you walk too far, the weight should be heavier. (Doing it with just one hand is called a suitcase walk.) The next time, you try to walk further, or use a heavier weight. A squeeze-ball would be fine to do remedial work on that hand, but I would recommend moving up to more complete exercises (e.g. pull-ups, deadlifts) as soon as possible. I would take care to restore full range of motion in the wrist as well, but that's better left to medical or physical-therapy experts. 

People who are fit can easily get hurt by applying that fitness to an activity that they're not used to. Their strength and conditioning engine is able to handle the workload, but their mobility and joints may not. In these cases you need something like Couch to 5k for the fit: a ramp-up program that challenges you while not overstepping the capabilities of your bones, ligaments, and tendons. I'd try dramatically reduced running volume--something like ~1km at first--before ramping back up slowly, perhaps adding a kilometer every third run, to 10km. Sprints, if they don't aggravate the issue more, could be used to increase the intensity without adding problematic volume. I would also consider the possibility that you could develop a tougher constitution through strength training. Weight-bearing exercise is great for bones and ligaments when done in a progressive manner. Deadlifts, power cleans, and squats come highly recommended for runners. 

It really depends on which supplement you are taking. If it is a nitric oxide supplement with green tea extract in it for instance, at least from personal and anecdotal evidence you tend to get less exhausted during your workout and as a result you can do more volume and/or greater intensity. That comes from the way the body breaks down Nitric Oxide. The caffeine keeps you alert and raises your heart rate. Note though that taking it for long periods of time does tend to reduce your level of intensity during your workouts (Again anecdotal, not true for everyone). Taking it after a workout may help your body circulate nutrients better but don't quote me on that, I'm not a doctor. I do however know that some pre-workouts come loaded with L-arginine and some other amino acids which help with recovery time. So if you want you could take a pre-workout afterward and you can see some benefit but the question is why would you do that when you can get a supplement designed specifically for that purpose and save your money? In reference to your green tea question, theoretically consuming green tea or green tea supplement has numerous health benefits (Vitamin C, helps skin, high fluoride content for you bones, helps lower cholesterol, the list goes on for days) regardless of your timing, so its not unsafe to say it may assist in your recovery. Consuming it prior to your workout will yield the results I stated above, essentially a better quality workout because of the caffeine content but you don't have the added effects of the nitric oxide. Consuming it afterward would keep your metabolism up after your workout is ended but its negligible if you are doing any kind of cardiovascular training as studies show your metabolism stays in a higher state for hours after your workout anyway. So at that point you would be taking it for the nutritional value and to stay awake. So no matter what you are benefiting. Know that it does contain caffeine and like any drug/herb your body gets used to it and will require more for the same effect; in your case the pre-workout alertness feeling. As far as a difference between drinking a pre-workout versus regular green-tea, that is more of a personal preference. Taking a pre-workout consistently for a long period of time is not exactly great for your liver and kidneys depending on which brand you choose. You may also become dependent on it to get you through your daily gym routine which is also not good. Finally the affects tend to become less noticeable after extended periods of time. It is also more expensive than green-tea and does not have the same nutritional value. At least with green tea when your body adapts to consuming that level of caffeine you still benefit from the other nutrients in it. (That is not to say there are no nutrients in pre-workout supplements) Should you avoid a pre-workout completely? That is up to you but there is nothing wrong with keeping some around the house for days when you don't feel like training or you feel sluggish. Should you drink green-tea before and/or after? It is once again personal preference and there are numerous health benefits so it can't hurt your recovery. So in summary, get both if you want. Drink your natural green tea every day (before and after is fine as long as you don't have heart problems) and keep some pre-workout around for those days when you feel lazy. Try not to take the pre-workout every day though. I hope that helps, sorry it was so long but you asked a very multifaceted question. 

I get very tired and restless if I try to stand all day. If I got rid of my chair completely, I would be unhappy. In contrast, I feel awesome if my day is spent switching every hour between a standing desk, sitting desk, and reclining (on a couch with my feet up, preferably). Add frequent two-minute walks for added benefit. The problem is that we are simply not meant to work at a desk or laptop for eight hours. Period. Even mitigating the problems by standing, sitting, reclining, switching, and taking walks won't get rid of the fundamental problem, which is that we should really just do less computer/desk work. 

I'd try more sets, or more rest between sets, or not going to failure in each set, or some combination of those strategies. For rep schemes, you could try shooting for a certain number of sets of a certain number of reps. For instance, 5 sets of 10, which would be double your current volume. Once you accomplish that, try shortening the rest periods, adding sets, or increasing the target number of reps. You could also try ladders (10, 9, 8, 7, 6... or 1, 2, 3...9, 10, 9, 8...2, 1). Three sets to max with thirty seconds rest is getting stagnant. Start playing with the dials on your workout: total volume, per-set volume, rest times, number of sets, and so on. 

If you don't like exercise, you can focus on improving your diet. Cut down on sugar and flour. Cut out fried foods. Eat more vegetables, especially green leafy ones. Consult your doctor or a nutritionist about supplements. You can also incorporate more "stealth" exercise into your daily routine rather than setting aside explicit exercise time. Take the stairs rather than the elevator. At work, if you are just reading or on the telephone rather than actively typing at the computer, try standing rather than sitting. These changes won't produce fast results—nothing except for maybe lipo-suction will—but they will produce results. Safely. Good luck! 

There is almost nothing better you can do for yourself than to quit drinking soda. A number of recent studies have shown that the rise of obesity in less-developed countries is almost entirely due to soda! Just the availability of soda, without any other changes to the diet, is enough to significantly tip the epidemiology of a population. Anyways, if you cannot bring yourself to forgo soda completely, you should at the very least try to have it side-by-side with high-fiber and/or high-protein food that will buffer the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream. If you want a can of soda, have an apple or a turkey sandwich at the same time. Other than the taste, the thing you are addicted to is the instant blood sugar spike you are getting from unbuffered high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). And if you can't or don't want to cut out the sugar in soda, try to cut out the sugar elsewhere. Good luck! 

I recommend milk, banana, berries, yogurt, and a scoop of whey powder, and if you like, peanut butter or another nut butter. Most whey powders are combined with BCAAs, so you don't need to get them separately. Proper Use Drink the shake right after working out. Don't replace meat wholesale with whey shakes. Whey is meant to be used as a supplement of convenience, not as a primary protein source like milk, eggs, or meat. If you're looking to replace meat in general for ethical-sustainability reasons, and not just after workouts, increase your milk and egg intake and look into local, grass-fed, grass-finished, free range meat. 

Strength is one of the physical attributes that takes longest to atrophy. Muscle endurance, cardio (particularly for a specific activity), and so on deteriorate much more rapidly. For instance, in Science of Sports Training, Tom Kurz references Wilmore and Costill 1988 and 1999: 

Excluding the non-powerlifting and other extraneous elements of my home gym, I spent a whole lot less than your plan. Here's how. 

The International Olympic Committee has a similar but more stringent policy, extending the hormone-transition requirement to two years and requiring surgery and political recognition: 

Your problem is that you're not giving your body a chance to get better at cardio. One session where you get tired isn't enough. You need to do that one session, then go back a day or two later and do it again. Nobody can expect to be good at something they don't do. (It happens, but those are happy accidents.) You're not doing cardio, so you're bad at it. Try going to the gym and doing your 15 minutes of cardio, then no matter how it goes, going back two days later and doing 15 minutes again. Repeat this process until 15 minutes isn't so bad, then do 20 minutes, and so on. Don't wait for your body to get good at cardio without working at it. 

This won't build muscle or improve cardio, but you may want to consider asking your advisor for a standing or adjustable desk (good luck!) or rigging one yourself. I try to work standing up at least for an hour a day, I just put my laptop on a bookcase. If I am just reading something I will also try to do it standing up. Man (and woman and child) was not meant to sit in a chair for 8+ hours day after day. 

An exercise regimen that targets muscle-building (i.e., anaerobic activity, intense muscle breakdown and rebuild, and a heavy diet) is fundamentally different than one that targets weight-loss (i.e., aerobic activity, lighter muscle breakdown and rebuild, and a lighter diet). I can see why taking a week off from muscle-building will help the former—you are giving your muscles additional time to rebuild. But a weight-loss routine doesn't emphasize muscle rebuild—so that particular benefit is reduced. At the same time, you could lose a tiny bit of aerobic conditioning that you had built up. However, if you need a mental break from exercise—and who doesn't?—by all means take a week off and come back re-charged and re-dedicated. Just take it easy on the cupcakes! 

You also have the 132 lbs. of your body available to you although it is easier to use it to exercise some muscles (e.g., chest and triceps via push ups) than others. Given that you are a beginner, you can start with a program that uses body weight plus the small weights you have. By the time you max that resource out, other options could become available or you can jury rig something like @Stormtroopr suggested.
