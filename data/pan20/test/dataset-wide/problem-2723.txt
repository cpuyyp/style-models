According to Bertrand Russell, truths are different from facts. Facts are independent of the mind but truths are not because true and false are properties of beliefs. Truths are synonymous to true beliefs. This distinction is important because everyone is trapped in their own skull. All that a person experiences are mental events in their own head. Thus all of our knowledge about the objective world are true beliefs ( or truths ) about facts. Scientific research can generate a lot beliefs that are very likely to be true. Nevertheless, scientific knowledge are mere reflections of facts, can infinitely approximate facts but guarantees neither truthfulness nor accuracy. Science does not automatically imply truth. As a matter of fact, scientific knowledge is highly tentative, subject to revision based on new evidence. 

As of now, I can only say, art belongs to the realm of emotions, and emotions do not submit to the command of will. I'd appreciate it if you can share your insight with us. 

Yes, they should care about emotions. Emotions give us purpose. Emotions, feelings and desires are at the core of what used to be called morality. Morality disappears after analysis; emotion will not. The following is an excerpt from Bertrand Russell's "What is an Agnostic." 

Two mistakes in traditional usage of syllogisms were discovered by Peano, Freg, Whitehead & Russell, and were subsequently removed from set theory. Mistake One: Before Peano and Freg, traditional syllogisms mistook the relation of membership (∈) for a particular case of inclusion (⊂). This was pointed out by Peano. As a matter of fact, in virtual of traditional Barbara(AAA), "Socrates is mortal" can never be asserted. The following is an excerpt from Russell & Whitehead's Principia Mathematica: 

I'm mostly interested in Fear and Trembling and on Either/Or. Can I read it straight away or is it recommended to read any other books first. If that's the case, which books then? I'm sorry for the noob question, but it is because Kierkegaard is what got me interested in philosophy, but I never read anything but the Seducer's Diary (from Kierkegaard), and now I want to read the books I mentioned, and I don't know if it it will be hard to read them straight away. 

I'm reading Either/Or and I'm progressing quite well with the book. I'm supplementing it with some external resources where needed, but for the most part I'm doing well without those, by the way, I'm reading Hong's translation, that not only is unabridged but brings a handful of very useful footnotes where needed (unlike Alastair Hannay's translation). However, it's been quite a few times already that I see Kierkegaard using the words "Recollection" and "Repetition", and I also have the impression he makes some differentiation between what he thinks to be "Recollection" - whose definition I don't know, even though from context it can be inferred it has something to do with the act of remembering - and "Remembering". I also looked for it on google and I didn't find any article that shed light on these doubts. There still are a bunch of articles on Repetition, but they didn't quite clarify my doubts either. Thanks. 

I'm not sure what your assignment is asking for. One of Russell's hallmark habits of mind is that he sifted through bodies of work then pointed out hidden premises then went on to reduce the number of premises to bare minimum. If your assignment is asking students to use Russell's methods to analyse Russell's work, I am indeed surprised; this is a great idea. Premise 1. We cannot draw inferences from experience to what is not experienced unless we know general principles of some kind by means of which such inferences can be drawn. A sure way to demonstratively prove all cases is to examine each and every case. To prove all ships in your squadron are mission capable, every and each ship must be thoroughly inspected. When it is impossible to demonstratively prove every and each case, general principles of some sort must be known in order to draw inferences from particular to general. Premise 2. If P implies Q, then the probability of P is less than the probability of Q because whenever P happens Q happens, whereas when Q happens P may or may not happen. Premise 3. Failed cases cannot disprove a probability statement. An improbable event can nevertheless happen; that an improbable event happened does not invalidate the statement that this event is an improbable event. Suppose a man, as of January 1, 2000, had seen a great number of swans, all of which are white, and he speculated that all swans are white. Even if all the swans he saw after he made that statement turned out to be black, his later experience cannot invalidate the statement he made on January 1, 2000 because counter examples cannot invalidate a probability statement. Premise 4. A principle cannot be used to prove itself. Using examined cases to prove unexamined cases relies on the inductive principle itself, thus inductive principle cannot be proved by enumerating examined cases. No. 1 says the inductive principle is need in order to make inferences from particulars to general. No. 2 says the probability of the general law is less likely than the particular case. No. 3 says the inductive principle cannot be disproved by experience. No. 4 says the inductive principle cannot be proved by experience. 

The following may be an example of accepting a non-existent object to define an existent object. Perhaps it is an example of an unaccepted object used to understand an accepted solution. If not an answer, then a probing at the question. In the 16th century, the formula for the solution to a cubic equation of the form $x^3 + px + q = 0$ was found (by an entanglement between three mathematicians: Gerolamo Cardano, Niccolo Fantana Tartaglia, and Lodovico Ferro: Cardano was Tartaglia's student and claimed Tartaglia's work to be his own which eventually led to dual and Ferrari was Cardano's student who eventually completed the solution to the problem of the cubic formula). For example, to solve the equation $x^3 - 3x = 0$ using the formula, one gets $x = \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{-1}} - \sqrt[3]{\sqrt{-1}}$. Imaginary numbers were not widely accepted and used in mathematics until 200 years later, beginning with Euler. But, to solve this cubic equation and get that $x=0$ is a root, using the cubic formula, one had to accept the existence of $i = \sqrt{-1}$ (and therefore $\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{-1}}$) briefly, long enough to subtract it from itself. i did not exist yet (in the minds of mathematicians), but it was used to find a real solution. This view of $\i$ is due to Saul Stahl in his historical introduction to Algebra: Introductory Modern Algebra 

The Theory of Types is consistent with both the vicious-circle principle and the range of significance principle. 1.1 All the arguments that are significant by the Theory of Types are also within the range of significance, although sometimes regarding whether the argument is forbidden or not the Theory of Types is mute. 1.2 When an argument is explicitly forbidden by the Theory of Types, it is also beyond the range of significance. 1.3 Some arguments, which the Theory of Types does not explicitly forbid or permit, are forbidden by the range of significance. The range of significance is an integral part of a propositional function's definition. 2.1 In the case of such functions as "arcsine(x) = 0", the range of significance is explicit, [-1, 1]. 2.2 In the case of ordinary language, the range of significance is often unclear, which is the cause of many confusions. 2.3 The Theory of Types greatly improved upon the clarity of ordinary language by explicitly forbids a range of arguments from being part of the range of significance and by pointing out that the source of this class of confusion is the lack of a clear definition of the range of significance. 2.4 When the range of significance is unclear, the Theory of Types greatly narrows the grey area between significant and insignificant values; when the range of significance is clearly defined, the theory of types is redundant. Where the significance of an argument is dubious, there are simple tricks to test it without invoking the theory of types: 3.1 By looking at what the resulting value of a propositional function implies and see if it is capable of being either true or false: For example, "x is a man" implies "x is lighter than the earth." (This is not a purely logical implication; there are empirical premises.) If "quadruplicity is heavier than the earth" is false, then the negation would be true, which is not the case. Thus "quadrupliciy" is beyond the range of significance. Same can be said about why the proposition "Socrates is a man" cannot be a meaningful argument to "x is a man." 

I've got "The Fourfold Root" and "The World as Will and Representation", and I'm very much tempted to read them, however the untranslated quotations in Greek and Latin turn me completely off. Any quotes in other languages could be easily translated, however, these languages... It is also important to notice that I usually read on my Kindle, since I live in Brazil and in reason of the populace's general distaste for anything of an even mildly intellectual nature plus the government's extortion makes it either very difficult to find such material in print, or it's rather too costly for an average man to buy them, or both. So, I'd prefer one that's easily found as an ebook. Many thanks in advance. 

I'm new to philosophy and I've only read Plato and some essays by Schopenhauer so far, so please be patient with me. I'm reading the first part of "Either/Or" - Diapsalmata - and have found the first part of it very poetical and melancholic. Now I entered it's second part and stumbled upon this: 

I have no problem at all with the part which is not in bold typeface, but from there on, I'm struggling to get his point. It may be even inappropriate to say it here in this QA, but after reading and re-reading and then again I am still like "what the heck is this guy talking about?". Plus, I would like to know what does this have to do with Hegel's philosophy, because in my book's footnotes it seems all of these ideas appear to have something to do to Hegel's philosophy, which one has told me before is contested by Kierkegaard, but here he doesn't seem like doing it. 

The world is made of facts. Facts can only be defined ostensively, i.e. by pointing at this and that and say "this is a fact." E.g., "there is a millipede in my living room" is a fact. Facts do not depend on the mind. There are unknown facts. Truth is a property of belief. Belief is a state of organism, including mental state. If there is no organism, there is no belief. If there is no belief, there is no truth. Whether a belief is true or not depends on if there are facts corresponding to this belief. E.g, I'm in a state of mind that can be expressed as "there are at least ten millipedes in my living room." This belief is capable of being true or false; all I need is to check if there is such a fact. The following are quotes from Bertrand Russell's Human Knowledge: its scope and limits: 

It is no coincidence that this modern scientific age is heralded by the Renaissance, and the Renaissance began with the art. It is no coincidence that all great civilizations were preceded by great poets. Another curious fact about perception is that everything you see over there in your perception is physically here because perceptual space is inferred from sensations, and sensations are limited to here and now (in the mind) - remember that the actual thing you see is a patch of colour in your own head. 

If we were able to live in the "reality" of every moment then perhaps philosophy would be unnecessary since we would be in tune with the true wisdom of experience. But this is not the case. Instead of experiencing the moment fully we think through the moment or get washed away by emotion. Thus, since this is the current condition, philosophy (like poetry :)) can help us to replace thought patterns with fresh philosophical statements, which will have to eventually be replaced by a fresher philosophy... Since we are so intelligent, studying philosohy or mathematics can organize the mind and leave space for true experience. There seems to be a human state which is able to experience fully and at the same time, through careful observations of others and self, use the mind to philosophize, see truth, and be able to verbalize it. There is an interesting and visually appealing book which discusses a related question through the history of philosophy called "Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosohy" by Donald Palmer. 

In my experience, math is not exactly science. I'm a set-theorist so it's very philosophical. Science is an approximation and math (some philosophy) is about pure reality. 

The ontological proofs that God exists by Anselm and Descartes use the logical device of contradiction, but their assumptions are indeed questionable. Anselm assumes that the greatest being that can be concieved of must exist outside the mind otherwise it is not the greatest being one can concieve of. So that the concept of such a being implies its existence. Descartes assumes that existence is more perfect than non-existence and so God, being perfect, has the attribute of existing. Both, however, do not jump from the assumption about existence being a part of God's nature to the conclusion that "therefore God exists". If this were so, their arguements would seem blatanly un-logical since they both assumed what they were trying to prove. Instead, both find a contradiction with the statement "God does not exist" (based on their assumption) and thus make the conclusion. Do their argument's seem more logical since they found a contradiction? Is it appropriate to use the law of excluded middle for this subject: if "god does not exist" is false then "god exists" is true? If we accept that existence is a characteristic of that which we conceptualize as God then yes, God exists by finding a contradiction with "God does not exist" and then using the law of excluded middle to conclude "God exists". 

Wittgenstein's understanding of Russell's Theory of Type is very shallow and muddle-headed, but I'll make an effort to interpret what he says. Wittgenstein thinks that a function's prototype determines what kind of argument it can take - this is exactly how some computer language, like C, define functions. Since the function is defined this way, if it is used otherwise, the resultant meaning is undefined: F(x) is defined as a function that takes individuals as arguments. G(U(x)) is defined as a function that takes first order function as arguments, where 1st-order function are those who takes only individuals as arguments. Since F(x) can only take individuals as arguments, F(F(x))'s meaning is undefined. Suppose there is such a thing as F(F(x)), the outer function takes first-order function as arguments, the inner function takes individual as arguments, therefore they are actually different functions using the same symbol. ∃ means there exists. (∃Φ):F(Φ(u)).Φ(u)=Fu means there exists a 1st-order function Φ such that Φ satisfies the 2nd-order function F(Φ(u)) and Φ(u) = Fu. Wittenstein tries to show that F(Φ(u)) and Fu are different functions having in common only the letter F. Ignoring Wittgenstein's misuse of symbolism, his argument can be simplified like this: I designated this basket for apples only, therefore you must not put baskets in this basket, and if you see a basket inside another basket, the outer basket must be a totally different type of basket. Basically, Wittgenstein just demonstrated how the Theory of Types works, but failed to explain the underlying principles and concerns that gave rise to the Theory of Types. Whitehead and Russell, in Principia Mathematica, invoked the vicious circle principle to dispel Russell paradox. The vicious circle principle states that a totality must not contain itself as a constituent because the totality cannot be determinate until each of its constituent is determinate; if one of the constituent is the totality itself, then the totality is indeterminate. The vicious circle principle determines why a function must not take itself as an argument. A function Fŷ -please notice the hat - denotes a totality. Suppose there are only two individuals in the world, Socrates and the earth, then the functions "ŷ is a man" denotes the totality {Socrates is a man, the earth is a man}. It follows that the meaning of Fŷ presupposes - or depends on - its values. Fy - no hat here - denotes one of Fŷ's values when y is substantiated, i.e., either "socrates is a man" or "the earth is a man", but ambiguous. It follows that propositions of the form Fy must not involve Fŷ because Fŷ is indeterminate until Fy is determinate and, if Fy depends on Fŷ, Fy is indeterminate. Therefore, F(Fŷ) has no meanings.
