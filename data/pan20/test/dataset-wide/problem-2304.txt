The simplest thing is to put the sling through the belay loop, which then gives me the two ends of the sling hanging out of either side. If I bring these ends together, I can clip in with a biner. For reasons explained below, I think this is a very poor method. I can tie a butterfly in the sling and adjust it to get the desired length. I can tie an overhand or figure-8 in the middle of the sling and load it at the knot. 

In the first example, the angle between the anchor strands is zero. Both anchors pull straight up on the biner, and each supports 50% of the load. In the second example, all three angles are 120 degrees. The situation is totally symmetrical, so all three forces are equal in strength. Each anchor strand has to be able to support 100% of the load. For example, if the climber is hanging from the rope (a static load), and weighs 100 pounds, then each anchor strand will also be subject to 100 pounds of stress. This is obviously not that great a situation, and each anchor is just as likely to fail as if you had simply hung the climber off of that anchor alone. However, the anchor is redundant, so this is still better than a single anchor. The third example shows a hypothetical situation where the angle at the top opens up to 180 degrees. This isn't actually physically possible. Each anchor strand is only applying a horizontal force to the biner. There is no upward force on the biner that could cancel the downward force from the climber's strand. No matter how tight you were to pull the two anchor strands, they would never flatten out to 180 degrees. As the angle gets closer and closer to 180 degrees, the strain approaches infinity, and you're guaranteed that something in the system will fail. Maybe the rope will snap, or maybe the biner will break, or maybe one of the anchors will pull out. There is nothing magic about 60 degrees. As the angle increases, the stress on each anchor increases. An angle of 50 degrees could be too much, if your anchors were poor and you needed to hold a big dynamic load. An angle of 90 degrees could be perfectly OK, if the anchors were good and they just needed to hold a small static load. There could be a situation where I just had no choice but to do an arrangement like the 120-degree example, because it just wasn't physically possible to set up with a smaller angle. (Maybe something's in the way, or there's not enough rope, or the smaller angle would require the biner to be so low that I couldn't safely reach it, or the smaller angle would send anchor strands over a sharp knife-edge of rock.) I would still prefer such a setup to a non-redundant anchor. 

You could think through some of the possible problems based on your knowledge of the area: roads with fast traffic; cattle that could hurt the dog; livestock such as chickens that the dog could kill; other dogs that live there and would be defending their territory. If none of these seems like a real issue, then I would just let the dog roam freely around the campsite. She might go chasing after a squirrel, but unfortunately for her, squirrels know how to climb trees. If these other issues do seem to make it a no-go to let her roam freely, then I would keep her tied to a tree, not penned up in the tent. I would think that keeping a dog inside a tent would be a disaster. 

Consider using freezer-bag cooking. You boil your water in a pot, then pour it into a freezer bag with your food to cook. Advantages: 

-- $URL$ It sounds like drinking water with dirt in it is not usually a problem in and of itself, but may be correlated with the presence of disease-causing organisms or nasty stuff like pesticides and fertilizers. Of course if the alternative is to get seriously dehydrated, you're going to have to take your chances by drinking the water. 

This answer assumes that you're trying to attach something to a loop (the black and green band in your photo) that you can't open up. If you can open up the loop, then see ShemSeger's answer. It depends on how quickly you need it to release, and how important it is to you for it to stay secure. A secure knot that is pretty easy to untie, even after it has been loaded, is the offset overhand knot. I have had my keys in a loop of cord tied with an offset overhand, and after a year or two, the knot is still there. For good security, make sure to leave long tails, and dress and tighten the knot carefully. If it's important to you to be able to release the knot very quickly, you could use a slipped square knot, i.e., the one you use to tie your shoes. 

You certainly don't want to climb so high that your hips are above the clip before you do the clip. Your arms aren't long enough to reach down that far. When leading trad, I would typically prefer to place the piece right in front of my face, so that I can carefully look at the placement and get it right so it will hold. In sport climbing, however, this isn't a concern. All other things being equal, we would like to minimize: 

I use a personal locator beacon (PLB), which just allows me to send a signal in an emergency showing my location. If it can get a GPS signal, it broadcasts my location, but if it can't, it still acts as an omnidirectional beacon. There is no monthly fee. Every few years, NOAA asks me to update/verify my contact info. There is a battery check feature, so I can tell when it's time to replace the battery. The idea is that this is a device that I often bring with me, but hope never to use. An alternative is something that's more of a communication device, such as a SPOT. These allow you to send text messages, tell people everything is OK, etc. They generally have a monthly fee. I don't see the communication features as worthwhile, and I don't want a monthly fee. 

This is called rolling, inverting, or capsizing. What happens is that the knot turns inside out, and part of the tail is consumed. If this happens repeatedly, or the tail is short, you can use up the whole tail, and the knot fails. For example, an offset figure-eight is not a safe bend for use in tying two climbing ropes together for a rappel, because it can roll if you don't dress it carefully. There have been several deaths caused by people using this knot for this purpose. An offset overhand does not roll, so it's the preferred knot for this purpose. 

This is a very complicated topic, and you can take an entire course where you learn and practice the techniques. Reading an answer on SE is not going to be enough. You need to practice. The following is just an outline. There is an entire chapter in Freedom of the Hills on glacier travel and crevasse rescue. The first step is always going to be to construct an anchor so that the team can get out of arrest position. If the leader is the one who's fallen in, then the person at the opposite end of the rope would normally be the one who gets up and builds an anchor, while other team member(s) stay in arrest position. You build the anchor between the lip of the crevasse and the nearest person, so that everyone has tension released from the rope and can stand up. While doing this, you want to make sure not to create more victims, so e.g., the person building the anchor needs to be on a Prusik. Now talk to the climber and discuss the situation. You want to know if they're hurt. If possible, you can try to prepare the lip of the crevasse so that the rope doesn't become entrenched. For example you can see if you can get an ice ax or a pack under it. This will be easier if the victim is able to get to a stance and unweight the rope. In most cases, it is not possible to keep the climbing rope from becoming completely entrenched. If you have enough extra line, you may want to prepare a separate portion of the lip and throw down a separate rescue line. After this, you do not immediately start hauling the victim out. That's a last resort, and often it doesn't work. The following are various options to consider, roughly in order. 

Although black clothing absorbs radiation from the sun more than white clothing, this is somewhat offset by the fact that it also emits it more efficiently. Good absorbers are also good emitters. If you're standing in dark shade and the objects in your environment are cooler than the temperature of your clothing, then black clothing will theoretically cause the net effect of radiation and absorption to cool you faster than in the case of white clothing. In reality, I suspect that physics isn't the reason that people in various cultures and environments choose to wear white or black clothing. 

Your question is about how long it takes to lose the adaptation, but that doesn't seem to have been studied very thoroughly, so I'll start by relating the more well established information on how long it takes to gain the various adaptations and then circle back and try to answer your question somewhat. For each of the items above, House and Johnston give a "time for adaptation to begin" and a "time to end." I think the "time to end" means how long it takes until you're fully adapted. The time to begin is zero for 1-2, a few days for 3-4, hours for 5, and weeks for 6-7. The time to end is weeks to months for everything except 4, which is supposed to be complete in 1-2 days. #3 only happens above 5000 m, so you won't experience it at all from being at those altitudes in the Alps, but you can get the same effect by just taking acetazolamide (diamox). OK, so what about de-acclimatization? House and Johnston have a short section about this on p. 358, titled "How fast do you de-acclimate?" It seems to be short because there's not a lot of solid evidence. In one study, people spent 16 days at 4000 m, then went to sea level for 7 days, and then went up to 4300 and were tested. "They were found to retain about 50% of their acclimatization." Unfortunately, House and Johnston don't give a reference to who did this study. I would like to know, e.g., by what measure the 50% is computed. In another study, called "Operation Everest III," the subjects lost their elevated hemoglobin levels in only 4 days. So the evidence is obviously pretty scanty and not completely consistent. House and Johnson say: 

This depends a lot on what you plan to do, and I don't think there's any such thing as an all-purpose knife. I mostly use mine when hiking and backpacking, when it would be silly to bring a big, heavy knife that I don't need. For what I do, what works great is a tiny swiss army knife, which I mainly use for slicing food (knife blade), cutting moleskin (scissors), and pulling out splinters (tweezers). 

The terms to google on seem to be "turbidity," "total suspended solids," and "total dissolved solids." TSS refers to solids that can be eliminated by a filter, and TDS to solids that are in particles so small that they get through a filter. High TSS seems to be harmful to fish because it indirectly reduces the amount of oxygen: $URL$ Re safety for human drinking: 

I usually carry 10 single-length slings and 2 doubles, which means I have 24 carabiners just for the draws. That's a lot of biners, which is of course why most people will use all wiregates for this. That's not to say that it's impossible to do otherwise. I imagine that people climbing in the 1970s would have used nylon slings and non-wiregate oval biners, and obviously they managed to lead hard routes despite all that weight. When you're deciding whether to use a nonlocking biner or a locker, the usual criterion is whether the biner is a single point of failure and whether such a failure would have unacceptable consequences. For instance, that's why you use a locking biner when rappelling: it's a single point of failure, and if it fails, you're probably going to die. If you apply that criterion to this question, then I think the answer is that if you have a crucial piece of pro, without which you would be in big trouble, then it could make sense to use lockers at one or both ends of that sling. I don't do it myself, because I don't habitually carry enough lockers to spare for that purpose, but I do have an experienced climbing partner who does this once in a while. Usually I'll see him do it when he places his first piece of pro on a pitch -- the "Jesus nut" that ensures that if you fall, it won't be with a fall factor of 2. Another good example might be one of those run-out slab pitches where you only get one bolt in the middle, and that's all the pro there is. On a pitch that offers reasonable placements for pro, I would prefer just to place additional pieces rather than trying to beef up one piece by using a locker. Just because you have a locker on it, that doesn't mean that the piece itself is guaranteed to hold. If you don't have a big pile of lockers with you, another possibility is to use two non-locking biners, opposite and opposed.
