Another option is alternate realities. Granted, instead on relying on speculative FTL it relies on speculative alternate realities. And you'll still need a thingy to do that. There's an episode of Stargate Atlantis where they find a ship that just jumps from reality to reality, and they all are different in some major way. You can explore strange new worlds this way. It can be actual strange new worlds if the device is in a different location in each reality. It can be our own world where everything is just slightly off. You can explore differences in culture, and differences in one's life based on how events turn out. 

Technically, it is possible for things to travel at speeds greater than the speed of light in a medium (e.g. air, water) but lower than the speed of light in vacuum. c, the speed of light in vacuum, is the universe's speed limit, but like everything, light doesn't travel at the same speed everywhere. See Cherenkov radiation, particularly visible in nuclear pools. Some particles goes faster than the light in water, which gives that distinct blue tint. To make that work, you'll need three things: 

The simple act of looking in a microscope will get your nanobots exposed. Blood samples happen everyday, there's no stopping that. Nanobots might trigger metal detectors or interfere with sensible electronics enough to get investigated. Then there's the sudden drop in death rate. The accumulation of things out of the ordinary would raise eyebrows everywhere. So how do you protect your bots? The bad news is that tamper-proof does not exist. Even worst is that beyond any security measure you can imagine, there's nothing you can do against hackers having direct physical access to their nanobots. What you can do is mitigate the risk by lowering the probability of the risk occurring and/or lowering the impact of the risk happening. My suggestion would be to repurpose the nanobots entirely. Each batch of nanobots should be programmed (by having direct physical access only) with a single purpose, with an expiration date. They shouldn't be allowed to outlive their purposefulness. All operations would be done in a controlled environment (e.g. hospitals), and patients wouldn't be allowed to leave until the bots are out of their system. The bright side is that you don't need the secrecy anymore (not that you would be able to keep that secret either), and with those tweaks the risk should become acceptable. Although it doesn't cure death anymore, it should still able to prevent a lot of people from dying early. 

Imagine the human body has access to infinite energy through some magic. How could that be useful in any capacity to "boost" the immune system? By boost I mean more resistance to disease, and ideally the capacity to naturally heal from disease that normally require medical treatment (my go-to example being cancer). What would be the effects of an hyperactive immune system? I've read allergies, fever and other symptoms are signs the immune system is fighting something it considers harmful, or am I misinterpreting something? Note: Assume you can channel the energy exactly where you need it, in the exact appropriate quantity. 

Imagine an alien race. They are the creators of Unspecified Advanced Alien Technology™. One day they lose one of their ships. The crew had to evacuate, and the ship kind of crashed on a random planet. About four thousand years later, humans found that crash site, and found a few artifacts that they managed to reverse-engineer. These artifact are: a FTL drive core and an artificial gravity generator core. Those are the only two things that need to survive. They may be encased in a box, they may be made of indestructibium, whatever. What matters is that they survived against the elements. How are these devices functioning in the first place? Unspecified Advanced Alien Technology™. Essentially you have a core. You feed that core some electricity and a signal, and then it does stuff based on the signal. How did the ship survive the crash? By using some sort of foam-airbag-thingy. The ship was engulfed in that, which allowed it to survive entry and the crash. Then the thingy degraded, so it couldn't have protected the ship for very long. Are the devices functional? Not really. There are in one piece, give or take a few bumps. They were in a good enough condition that they were taken apart, studied and copied; but not in a good enough condition to be working. The question is: What kind of materials could survive for that long unattended? We assume nothing was destroyed by the impact, however since then a lot of stuff has stopped functioning. We'll limit to materials that exist on Earth, or materials that can be manufactured using materials that exist on Earth. The fancier the materials, the better. I'm looking for a few types of materials that could be reasonably used in complex machinery/electronics. If your answer is none, then what kind of materials would survive the longest, and for how long? 

Here is the scenario: Two factions, one defending its planet, the other attacking it. The winning condition for attackers is capture of leadership, so boot on the ground are required. The planet is Earth-like, the capital metropolis is coastal. WMDs on the surface are off the table. Defenders have a wide range of equipment at their disposal, from surface-to-orbit missiles, to spaceships, satellites, planes, VTOLs, airships, choppers, tanks, boats and submarines. Attackers are capable to launch and recover planes from orbit. They can launch troop transports from orbit as well. They have no lack of orbit-to-surface artillery either. They can match defenders in space, in the air and on the ground, but not really on the sea. Attackers can rain death from above on anything on the surface, that includes boats. While boats can be used as a platform to launch aircrafts, troops and artillery strikes, those capabilities are redundant. Bringing in boats from space is somewhat of a logistical problem. On the other hand, opening another front could have its advantages to divide defenders' attention. Launching planes/troops from the sea surface might also be less risky. It would be a new tactic, so there is the element of surprise to consider. The first question would be: Is it even worth taking the fight to the sea? Now, assuming we want to fight aquatically, attackers have developed a new type of vehicle, dubbed Space/Naval Hybrid Assault Platform (military loves acronyms). It is a space-worthy ship specifically designed for the task of landing on water and floating thereafter. It cannot takeoff without assistance, and cannot fly in atmosphere beyond controlling its descent. It could conceivably be single-use, e.g. you could disassemble it for building materials for a base of operations on land, or you could just beach it for similar results, or it may just be a fancier carrier/assault boat. So the other question would be: What are benefits and drawbacks of such ships, and what would they best be used for? 

I suppose it could be a controlled substance like GHB and stuff. Granted, that would probably work about as much as it does on GHB and stuff. If the potion was very distinctive looking, with a very distinctive smell and taste, that would make it quite hard to spike drinks with it. If you order a beer and it looks purple and smells like vomit, chance are you'll know something is off. The limitation here is that you could still conceivable take advantage of someone who is high as a kite (unless the smell/color/taste was so bad it would make you sober on the spot and realize you were getting spiked). You could also say a ludicrous amount of potion is required for the effect to have any hold. Like, a liter. You are unlikely to drink a liter of potion by accident. None of that would prevent someone from tying another person up and force feeding (force drinking?) them, but I don't think there are many protections against that beyond straight up magic. I'm neither good at biology nor chemistry, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a particular molecule in your brain parts responsible for love and emotions, conceivably your potion could only work if that particular molecule was present in quantity, e.g. if you had true feeling to begin with. 

Maybe you shouldn't give that freedom to inmates. Prison serves three purposes: Rehabilitation. Let there be said that a prison that doesn't rehabilitate is a prison that does not work. Imprisonment. For people who pose a threat to society, imprisonment serves to protect said society. Punishment. Prison strips inmates of some of their freedoms and rights. Freedom of circulation, obviously. Depending on your jurisdiction, it could also include voting rights, freedom of speech, etc. In a country with euthanasia, then it may include the right to die. If you give inmates the right to die, you give them the right to reduce their punishment, which defeats the core purpose of prison. You have to remember that they are in prison because they (were convicted of having) wronged society, i.e. there's probably someone out there who lost a loved one because of them. You should ask yourself if allowing suicide isn't giving them a "get out of jail free" card. 

In a lower tech setting, crossbows and bows are acceptable substitutes to firearms, although it would make magic would be comparatively even more powerful and less expensive. To the caster though, it will cost the same regardless, but the reload time on a crossbow is significantly higher than with an assault rifle, so it may be just slightly faster to throw magic rocks than it would be to reload a crossbow, aim and fire. There's nothing a knight in heavy armor could do to stop a wizard from cooking them with a fireball, save for getting their sword inside said wizard fast enough. Generally speaking, I think it would be a good idea to stay in melee range. They can't use AoE magic against you (like fire, because convection), and if it takes time/focus to cast a spell, they can't really afford that cost when there's the imminent threat of a sword coming for their spine. People in a medieval setting may also be very impressionable, so using magic might convince them to just run the eff away and not look back.
