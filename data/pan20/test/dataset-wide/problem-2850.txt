(b) Objective standards are fundamentally pointless. Well relativism doesn't really specifically address whether objective standards have a point or not. Mainly, it places limits on societies to practice imperialism but in no way enforces the validity of this belief. So, for example, while a cultural relativist will not take a strong stance against sexism, relativism does not innately reject this stance as wrong or useless, merely as unreasonable. (c) What has happened in the past is irrelevant Cultural relativism, to me, seems to have two purposes: 

Happiness is to be earned. Kindness is to be earned. Justice is important. The value of life is a function of its genetic similarity to myself. Rules are relative. 

A cone is a sum of infinitely many cross sections. If we cut the cone at one cross section, the cross section above it and the cross section below it must be either the same size, or different. (2a) If they are different, then the cone must change size significantly at this exact cut, i.e. it has a "step", which seems false. (2b) If they are the same, then every cross section is the same as the next one, so no cross section can differ in size from any other cross section, and so the cone is indistinguishable from a cylinder. This seems false as well. 

If some first-order statement is true in every domain larger than a domain D, then it is true in D. But this is only true if D is not the empty set. Philosophically, we want our statements to be true of all sufficiently large domains of discourse, but this theorem says that including finite ("small") domains of discourse does not change things. However, including the empty domain of discourse would change things. It's easy to tell anyway whether a first-order statement is true for the empty domain. So it seems unnecessary to include this in our theory when we can just handle it as a special case. 

So X either wants a license not to respect teachers, or the teachers to respect X. What X can control: X can show respect or not show respect. Strategy 1: X does not show respect. As X does not show respect, by X's own philosophy teacher's won't show respect. Therefore no respect is earned and no respect is shown. It is possible teachers may take initiative to show respect. I'm not going to cover that possibility as we know X has already taken initiative in this example. Strategy 2: X does show respect. As X shows respect, X is worth of respect. Case 1: If teachers operate under X's philosophy or similar they show respect to X. Mutual respect earned and shown. Case 2: If teachers operate under another philosophy, they may not show respect to X. X has earned respect but does not receive it, teachers have not earned respect but do receive it. Determining the optimal strategy then requires understanding pay-offs. Now, as the purpose of interacting with teachers is education, you could, for example, place a value of infinity on teachers receiving respect and a value of zero on teachers not receiving respect, as this should maximize educational potential. This would make strategy 2 optimal. If, however, education is not the aim, and minimizing cost is where respect confers a non-zero cost, then strategy 1 is optimal. I don't know X's utility curve, but this is the game theory beyond my recommendation. I do assume a non-zero value on education and a zero cost on showing respect, because that is the curve I operate under and was how I determined my own actions when I was in a circumstance akin to X's, and that is why I will always recommend strategy 2 as optimal. 

From the perspective of nonstandard analysis, one can come up with a different answer that is in some ways more direct. In this context, the two opposing surfaces (circles) that are formed when the cone is cut are NOT in fact equal, but differ by an infinitesimal amount. Here is this analysis in more detail. I paraphrase Democritus' paradox as follows: 

Quine's short 1954 paper, Quantification and the Empty Domain (Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol 19 Number 3 September 1954), addresses this. Quines two reasons are: 

Premise (1) may seem to be preposterous from the outset to many traditional mathematicians and laymen. But in the context of nonstandard analysis, premise (1) is in fact perfectly reasonable and true. Likewise, (2) is certainly true. The problem is in the meaning of "different". 

I find it extraordinarily unlikely that the most intelligent of domestic animals and primates don't exhibit higher forms of consciousness than some humans that have been ascribed consciousness. Especially in prolonged interactions with animals, its easy to ascribe to them the same thoughts and feelings humans have, though in a way somewhat affected by mental faculties. Other animals haven't developed to think and feel as we do, so there should be some expectation for difference. However, I think saying that any deviation from human mind confers a deviation from consciousness is quite arbitrary and difficult to separate philosophical arguments from those made on basis of apathy or ignorance. In general I believe: 

All crime is preventable by government. Implement nuclear holocaust, exterminate all human life, crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Well, maybe that's not what we want to do. Maybe we want government to guarantee certain rights. Say one of those is the right to life (the government loses the death penalty). Sterilize all humans. Wait for the second to last person to die. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Okay, maybe we need a right to procreate. Distribute all humans in such a manner they can never interact with each other, but provide for IVF. Without the possibility of any human interaction, all crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Perhaps we want to have a right to live anywhere we choose. Sedate all humans such that they are incapable of any action. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. This method requires autonomous care-takers. These might seem like unreasonable arguments, so I would ask - what is the fundamental philosophical difference between between these methods and a totalitarian police state? To me, there isn't one, and one of the reasons I think this question even came up is that some people today live under governments that do not guarantee sufficient rights that they have rights as a reason to not guarantee zero crime. The point being, all crime is preventable by government. What then, are the restrictions on crime prevention: 

For an n-ary function symbol, there are k^n elements of the domain; for each one you need to choose one of k elements to send it to. So the total number of possible function interpretations would be k^(k^n). For an n-ary relation, you have 2 possibilities for each of k^n possible n-ary lists. So what would be the total number of possible relation interpretations? 

In practice, however, doing mathematics is much more complicated, and logicists will have to concede that it is only after a lot of work that a field of math is reduced to purely logical terms. Intuitionism, formalism, and predictavism, as well as the more ancient platonism, have their own things to say. My own opinion is that an object is mathematical in the same way an object is physical: it is observed as a pattern in the real world. Thus I would say that all three of your examples are mathematical, the second and third merely being special cases of the first generic scheme. To clarify, mathematicians usually abstract away irrelevant details and focus in on very specific properties of things; so "Socrates" and "Mortal" are replaced by general concepts, and so "pile of rocks", "stack of coins", and "organism of cells" are all reduced to the abstract entity called a "set" (and, in these cases, a finite set). 

Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

One of the most fundamental debates in the philosophy of mathematics is a debate about what mathematics is. Your question ("What makes an object mathematical?") might be understood directly from understanding, "What is mathematics?" I would therefore suggest you begin by reading the SEP's list of the four main schools of thought. Each school answers the question differently. For example, to a logicist, an object is mathematical if it is simply a statement in some logical system. Thus, the first and third of your examples are certainly mathematics, and the second might be also if "socrates", "mortal", and "man" were axiomatically defined. A statement is mathematical if its content (meaning) can be defined in purely logical terms. Bertrand Russell defined mathematics thus:
