where it is shown that there is an absolute constant C so that a total C generators and relations is needed to define a presentation of a finite quasi-simple group, and indeed the total word length of the relations is bounded by C*(log(n)+log(q)) where n is the rank of the BN-pair and q is the size of the field of definition (and alternating and sporadic groups just get less than C). They left out the case of Ree groups (the characteristic 3 kind), but probably it will be taken care of at some point. If you want to explore these things in GAP, part of the documentation for GAP is dedicated to this problem: 

To get the decomposition matrix, you must not only have the Brauer table but also the ordinary table. You don't need much from the subgroup H, just a character to induce and the element fusion from H into G. This is theorem 2.13 on page 25 of Navarro's textbook on Characters and Blocks of Finite Groups. By projective, I mean in the module theory sense, an indecomposable direct summand of the regular representation, usually these are denoted Φi corresponding to a Brauer character φi. I don't mean representation into projective groups, like PGL. 

You can combine the two directions, but again because the first direction trivializes, the combined version looks pretty silly. Just take the direct product any example of the second direction and a cyclic group of order coprime to its |a|. This exhausts all possibilities, but I suspect most people would be irritated with the direct product aspect and only consider the second direction valid. If you relax the coprime hypothesis, then you get another type of example that is reasonably interesting: take the Sylow p-subgroup of the holomorph of a cyclic p-group. The center will have order exactly p. If ⟨b⟩ has order pn+1, then ⟨a⟩ will have order pn, ⟨a,b⟩ will have order p2n+1, and the center of ⟨a,b⟩ will be ⟨bpn⟩ of order p. The action of a on b is easy to write down: ba = b1+p. 

The first command gives you Irr(Sym(7)) in the variable chi, then chi(partition) gives you the specific irreducible Specht representation, and chi(partition)(permutation) gives you the matrix for that permutation. Permutations are specified in the combinatorics way by listing the images of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] in order, also called one-line notation. The specific permutation is (1,2,3)(4,5)(6)(7). According to magma one has: 

For algebras over non-prime fields, a good reference is Isaacs (1995). It proves a fundamental theorem establishing that these F-algebra groups behave like |F|-groups, not just like p-groups, for char(F) = p. I think these groups have been studied over Z/pZ or even Z/pnZ for a very long time. As far as a p-group not of the form 1 + J: any cyclic p-group of large enough exponent will do. For instance, the cyclic group of order 8 is not of the form 1 + J: |P| = |J|, and so J has dimension 3 over F = Z/2Z. Hence 1F+1J has dimension 4, and P is contained in a Sylow 2-subgroup of GL(4,2), and hence has exponent dividing 4. Similar bounds hold for odd p: the cyclic group of order p2 is not an algebra group, for instance. Every group of order dividing 8 (other than the cyclic group of order 8) is an algebra group. I assume you have already seen the use of p-restricted Lie algebras in finite p-groups. This takes a p-group and associates a Lie algebra with pretty similar properties as J has in 1+J. If not, then this may be exactly what you are looking for and is very well studied (refs on requests, but any "good book on p-groups" should work). 

For non-abelian groups G, the conversion of the characters into the matrices is a little harder (for abelian groups, the matrices are all 1x1 and really are just the character values), but at some point the matrices are too big anyways, and the characters are a more efficient data type. 

This is just Burnside's basis theorem. See for instance theorem 12.2.2 on page 178 of M. Hall, Jr.'s textbook on the Theory of Groups. The original reference for the phrasing in terms of automorphisms is from P. Hall (1933). As far as where to go from it, this is roughly how automorphism groups of p-groups are calcuated in O'Brien (1992), Eick–Leedham-Green–O'Brien (2002) and the AutPGrp package of GAP. This is often useful in understand fusion systems, where the p-core of automorphism groups is under good control, and so the GL(n, p) part is the primary interest. Another application (known to the OP, but interesting enough to describe clearly) is a result of Burnside (1905) classifying for which powers b = b(p, a, q) there is a group of order paqb with no non-identity normal p-subgroup: the classification is based simply on the orders of the automorphism groups of the p-subgroups. Burnside had an error in his analysis of the associated arithmetical condition that was corrected in Coates–Dwan–Rose (1976). Burnside's result was generalized in Glauberman (1975) and Bialostocki (1975, 1987). Many of these and further results are based on analyzing nilpotent p′-subgroups of GL(n, p), resting ultimately on the fact that that every p′-subgroup of the automorphism group of a p-group of rank n is isomorphic (including in some sense, its action) to a subgroup of GL(n, p). 

I'm having trouble distinguishing the various sorts of tori. One definition of torus is the algebraic torus. Groups like SU(2,ℂ/ℝ) and SU(3,ℂ/ℝ) have important subgroups that are topologically a circle and a torus, and I guess those were some of the most important Lie groups so the name torus stuck. Groups like SL(2,ℂ) and SL(n+1,ℂ) have a similar important subgroup isomorphic to ℂ* and (ℂ*)n, so the name torus gets applied to them too. In general, one calls the multiplicative group of an arbitrary field a torus in many situations, sometimes denoting the entire lot of them as Gm. Another definition of a topological torus is a direct product of circles. A standard way to construct various flat geometries on a torus is to take ℝn and quotient out by a discrete rank n lattice Λ, for instance ℝ/ℤ or ℂ/ℤ[i]. A complex torus is defined analogously as ℂn/Λ where Λ is a rank 2n lattice (since ℂn has real rank 2n). One reads in various places that every abelian variety is a complex torus, but not every complex torus is an abelian variety. The notation ℂn/Λ is usually nearby. 

Every group is the full group of isometries of a connected, locally connected, complete metric space: de Groot, J. "Groups represented by homeomorphism groups." Math. Ann. 138 (1959) 80–102. MR119193 doi:10.1007/BF01369667 Being a group of symmetries is the same thing as being a group. You may also be interested to know that every group is the full automorphism group of a graph, not just a subgroup. References for this and various refinements are given at the wikipedia page for Frucht's theorem. 

Example: The non-cyclic group of order four: For G the Klein four-group the irreducible characters are all real, and are [1,1,1,1], [1,-1,-1,1], [1,-1,1,-1,], [1,1,-1,-1]. The degree of each of these is 1, the first number. The kernel of each of these are the positions where the value and the degree are equal, so all of them have a kernel. If n was 10, then I'd look at all the ways of choosing non-negative integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=10 (so that the degree was 10) and such that at least 2 of b,c,d were non-zero (so that the kernel was trivial). There are 282 such combinations, one of which is a=5, b=0, c=2, d=3. This corresponds to the character 5*[1,1,1,1]+0*[1,-1,-1,1]+2*[1,-1,1,-1]+3*[1,1,-1,-1] = [ 10, 6, 4, 0 ]. It has degree 10 (the first and largest positive number) and trivial kernel (all the other positive numbers are strictly smaller). It corresponds to the representation g1 → diag( 1,1,1,1,1, -1,-1, 1,1,1 ) and g2 → diag( 1,1,1,1,1, 1,1, -1,-1,-1 ) and of course g1*g2 → diag( 1,1,1,1,1, -1,-1, -1,-1,-1 ). This is 5 copies of the representation g→1, g2→1, followed by two copies of g1→-1, g2→1, and finally three copies of g1→1, g2→-1. Since b=0 we did not include any copies of g1→-1, g2→-1. By some silly counting, the number of injections of the Klein four-group into GL(n,R) up to GL(n,R) conjugacy is (n^3+6*n^2+11*n-18)/6, so it grows somewhat quickly but not too crazily. 

has a generating set consisting of three involutions, two of which commute. In particular the Monster group does have such a generating set (a short proof in the first paper, an earlier proof due to Simon Norton in a letter). I (quickly) verified that A6, A7, A8, S4(3), M11, M22, M23 have no generating set of involutions where non-adjacent involutions commute (even for more than three generators). You can bound n by the 2-rank of the group: having lots of commuting involutions means you have a large elementary abelian subgroup, and so n ≤ 5 for these groups. 

You can use GAP to decompose a Q-class of a finite subgroup of GL(n,Z) into its component Z-classes. This uses the CARAT program from Aachen. To see the first few cases, you can use: 

If k is an algebraically closed field, then A = { f(x)/g(x) : g(0)⋅g(1) ≠ 0; f,g in k[x] } ≤ k(x) is a commutative ring with exactly two maximal ideals, (x) and (x−1). It has two simple modules and both happen to be one dimensional as k-vector spaces. It is a PID, so it has only one projective indecomposable module, which is of course free and cyclic as an A-module, but infinite dimensional as a k-vector space. Hence the rank of KP(A) is 1, and the rank of KF(A) is 2. This is just a modification of Victor Ostrik's example to cut down on the number of simple modules. 

It is difficult to find this number for arbitrary finite groups, but many families have been solved. A somewhat early paper that has motivated a lot of work in this area is: Johnson, D. L. "Minimal permutation representations of finite groups." Amer. J. Math. 93 (1971), 857-866. MR 316540 DOI: 10.2307/2373739. This paper classifies those groups for which the regular permutation representation is the minimal faithful permutation representation (cyclic of prime power order, K4, or generalized quaternion) and some results on nilpotent groups (improved in later papers). The minimal permutation degrees of the finite simple groups are known from: Cooperstein, Bruce N. "Minimal degree for a permutation representation of a classical group." Israel J. Math. 30 (1978), no. 3, 213-235. MR 506701 DOI: 10.1007/BF02761072. This paper only finds the degrees. A fuller description of the permutation representations are given in: Grechkoseeva, M. A. "On minimal permutation representations of classical simple groups." Siberian Math. J. 44 (2003), no. 3, 443-462 MR 1984704 DOI: 10.1023/A:1023860730624. There are a great deal of topics associated with minimal permutation degrees. I'll just briefly sketch them below, let me know if any interest you and I can give citations or longer descriptions: The minimal degree of a subgroup is never larger than the minimal degree of the parent group, but the minimal degree of a quotient group may be much, much larger than that of the original. This poses problems in computational group theory, since quotient groups may be difficult to represent. Some quotients are easy to represent, and this has had a significant impact on CGT in the last 10 years or so. Finding minimal permutation representations of covering groups can be difficult, and here I think the results are much less complete. Basically what you want are large subgroups not containing normal subgroups. In a covering group Z(G) is contained in really quite a few of the "good choices". This is because it is contained in Φ(G), the Frattini subgroup, the intersection of the maximal subgroups. One has to give up using maximal subgroups (at least if Z(G) is cyclic of prime power order), and so the minimal degree can increase dramatically. Minimal degrees of primitive permutation groups is a topic with a different flavor (rather than specific families of groups, it is more of the interactions between group properties), but a great deal is known. Similar techniques are used to describe asymptotic behavior of minimal degrees of arbitrary families of finite groups, and quite powerful results are available there. 

I include a selection of papers. I think you get a flavor for the results from these, but there are several I left out, just because the list was getting long. 

I don't think the idea of dominant dimension originated in KSX 2001. I don't know of any particularly interesting results, but probably a reasonable seed to start your search from is: Auslander, M.; Solberg, Ø. "Gorenstein algebras and algebras with dominant dimension at least 2". Comm. Algebra 21 (1993), no. 11, 3897-3934. MR1238133 DOI:10.1080/00927879308824773 There were too many papers referencing these to check for interesting results, but some of them were even just reference books, so I think it should not be too hard to find interesting properties.
