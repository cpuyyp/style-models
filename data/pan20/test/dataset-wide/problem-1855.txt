In addition to the existing answers regarding a reevaluation of the question whether this position is right for you and the possibility of donating a part of your salary, it is also possible that you have impostor syndrome. It seems that you hold yourself to higher standards than your boss does. (Unless he should also be unhappy with your performance but hasn't told you just yet.) These standards are a positive thing as long as you realize that you're already on par and aim higher, they should not keep you from being satisfied with your performance in general. 

It's rather ironic that you want to protest because your prospective title is not euphemistic enough. Usually, titles are overly euphemistic since they don't cost anything and motivate some employees. From that perspective, the interviewer should be quite happy to honor your request. This way, if you also ask for more tangible perks, he can tell you he has already given you the extra title. A problem arises if there is a whole team of web developers who do the same job as you and who didn't ask for a software engineer title. This could lead to tensions and therefore dissuade the interviewer fro mgiving you the title. 

The price of labor is determined by supply and demand. The employer does not have to offer wages that are nominally the same as in the US because he can find local employees with the relevant skills that are willing to work for less. As others said, equal pay legislation does also not apply across borders. Why is that? Why can't the employees negotiate for the same nominal wage when their work can be done remotely and their location does not really matter much? The costs of living differ from country to country. A wage of i.e. 35 lakh rupees per year in India may represent the same cost as 50k$ for the employer (tax considerations etc. aside), but not the same standard of living for the employee. While Indian engineers would surely appreciate the luxurious lifestyle that comes with 35 lakhs, there will be enough of them who are willing to settle for the reasonably good standard of living at 15 lakhs. This will become the market rate. The employer does not need to pay more. Does that mean that Indian and Chinese engineers have no negotiation power even though they provide comparable work as their western counterparts? No, this is not true either. The wage gap between developed and developing countries is much larger for unskilled jobs than for skilled jobs. This can be seen as a result of this negotiation power. The nominal salary is still lower than in Europe/the US, but the perceived standard of living needn't be. As an anecdote: Multiple Indian engineers have told me that, in spite of their hugely increased nominal salaries, they feel poorer now in Europe than they felt before in India. They can afford smaller apartments and fewer aides for their household work. reference material from McKinsey 

If you're worried about some "blacklist" in which other companies are all going to look at and keep from hiring you, there should be no concern. However, in the event you turn down an offer after a conditional verbal acceptance it's most likely you would not be working for them in the immediate future. I would also advise to discuss this issue with someone in HR to resolve the matter. Every company you work for will have its own case of hiccups and no job will be perfect. 

The question isn't stupid - if they ask you to think out the whole process as they want to see how you approach the problem. Mostly from an optimization standpoint. But ya, think about it from an optimization standpoint. Think out-loud, whiteboard, whatever and keep thinking "can I do this better?" 

This smells of rack & stack to me. As was previously mentioned in a few comments, your options are a bit limited in my opinion. However, I would mention that these are the types of things you should have also raised or mentioned during your performance review (if you have one). At that time of performance review, you could have asked what you needed to improve upon to reach these goals. If you wish to stay with this company/organization it may be best to have a one-on-one with your direct manager and inquire what they expect of you from your current level in the company, what you need to do to get to the next level and what you can do to better your chances of a raise next review. 

Sounds like you might be part of the problem here. You shouldn't be whistling in an open office environment, it's annoying and rude 

I was harassed by my direct supervisor at my old company. The harassement was all verbal and there were potential witnesses but few direct. For example, there were people within hearing distance/sitting in the next cubicle of the verbal abuse but it's not clear to me if they were paying attention. Some of the incidences where a while ago. I'll be needing to ask them if they remember the incidences. I'm guessing it's best to ask for their personal email and then email them the incidences and if they might remember any of them. Obviously, this is a loaded and sesitive topic. Is it best to make a first quick casual contact? Just send them an email saying hello would you like to keep in touch although it does sound awkward. Next ask them if they remember some incidences? Edit: I have already filed a lawsuit against the company. I don't have a lawyer I'm going it on my own. 

I've been working at my current job for about 7 months. I really like the company, my boss and the job. The pay is great and I'm comfortable in the role. I'm a web developer. The thing is... My husband wants to move in 8 months time! We want to move because we have no family where we are currently located. There is another office/branch for this company near our future home. It would be a move to another country. I don't have a work visa yet but because I am the spouse of a citizen I just have to get my passport stamped when I'm there. I hope that I don't have to quit working here altogether and could transfer or possibly work remotely part time. Other than losing a productive employee I don't see much benefit to transferring me for them. How and when should you tell them about your plans? How do you bring it up? 

This isn't totally uncommon. Google for instance was known to give study guides out for a while depending on the req they were looking to fill. It was so you could be well read on the items of discussion and be well prepared. 

You just have to spin up a bunch of nonsense that you probably don't mean. Something like, "While I am grateful for the opportunities that were presented to me during my time here - I feel that at this juncture its best for all parties if I move on" Then say something about how you will do all you can to transfer knowledge and help in the transition prior to your departure Then in your exit interview you say a bunch of nice things and leave. 

I would advise not turning down an offer from a company or notifying an employer of change in employment until an offer letter has been sent, signed and the return confirmed. Between an "unoffical" offer and time of receipt things can happen. Whether this be hiring freeze, pay freeze, etc you never know. 

I think it depends on the person, management and the organization. I've seen it go both ways as I think many others have. A former developer I worked with was not performing up to task. He was given the dreaded PIP - and from there shifted over to Q&A as an attempt to find a way to use him. 

Your mileage may vary but I've found the only way to get a decent pay raise in this industry is to switch jobs every several years. At company A despite amazing performance reviews and hitting every mark given and doing great work - the raise was always ~ 1% with different excuses every time. Jump to company B and snag a 15% pay jump. Lather rinse repeat 

If you are writing a bullying report for HR but you only have a vague idea of when the incident happened e.g. Early in March what do you say? Do you say that you don't know when? Or explain why you didn't write it down? I feel like this is murky territory. I mean you don't usually write down stuff that someone walks up to you and out of the blue says. 

If you have been subjected to long term harassment and they refuse to categorize the behavior as bullying or harassment despite the fact that by object measures it was, does that mean they don't care if you quit? They thought that I just didn't want to work there because I did not enjoy being hassled. Is that a sign they want you gone? They refused to own up to their behavior and just said we are 'different people'. 

I would absolutely not tell them the name of any medical condition you may have! It's extraordinarily personal and opens them up to being discriminatory. It would fall under disability discrimination. Also, there is a lot of stigma around certain ailments that might give some uninformed colleagues the willies. The best thing to do is just tell them that you have ongoing 'medical appointments' and that you will adjust your hours around them. If the depression affects your productivity then just tell them that you have a temporary medical condition you are experiencing and it may affect your productivity for time. If they see you looking sad just say you are very tired from the condition. Keep tabs on how things go after you tell them and consult an employment lawyer if they start mistreating you.
