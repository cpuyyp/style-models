Why a horse? Most WWII armies were not fully mechanized. With the exception of the US, they did not have the automotive industry to supply their whole army with vehicles. Infantry still walked. Artillery and supplies were horse-drawn, particularly in the German army. But in WWII, mobility was key. Getting firepower from point A to point B as quickly as possible could win the day, and that includes infantry. If you don't have enough trucks anything else will do: rail being the first choice, but also motorcycles, skis, bicycles, horses, or sitting on a tank. Mounted infantry made a lot of sense.

As at Midway, a Japanese carrier was hit while refueling and rearming its aircraft. All that fuel and explosives lying around greatly magnified the torpedo damage. 

A long weapon made even longer with a bayonet limits how you can go around corners, through doors, or turn around. The long "shaft" of the rifle can be easily side-stepped and grabbed by your opponent turning it into a liability. In these cases a pistol or dedicated close-quarters rifle is much preferred, but many soldiers lack these. So they pack a short, brutal, often improvised melee weapon. Modern armies are switching to even shorter weapons like the M4 carbine at 0.84 meters as their service rifle to ensure every soldier has a rifle that works in as many situations as possible. Repeating Weapon Finally, in the era of single shot muzzle loaders a melee weapon would be used simply because you couldn't reload your gun fast enough in the chaos of close quarter combat. This could be a bayonet, a sword, or even swinging your rifle like a club as in this popular (and probably not terribly accurate) painting of Davy Crockett in the Battle of the Alamo. 

The US walked a very tricky political line during Reconstruction. Politically it was a dance between being able to impose Federal power on the southern states while avoiding acknowledging succession. There were several minds about the legal status of Southern states at the time which competed during Reconstruction. One view, favored by Radical Republicans, was that the states were no longer part of the Union, but the people were. Thus the state governments were no longer legitimate. The land would be treated similar to a US territory and have to go through the process of statehood again. This position was favored by radicals because it allowed them a clean sweep of existing southern political power and prevent the plantation system from returning. However, it would have acknowledged that a state can voluntarily leave the Union. The Wade-Davis Act would have done just that. Even though it passed Congress, Lincoln vetoed it in part because it gave tacit acknowledgement to state succession. 

No. The deficiencies of the Luftwaffe at Stalingrad, most famously the failure by the Luftwaffe to supply their encircled forces at Stalingrad, was not due to a lack of aircraft in Germany as a whole. It was due to a lack of dedicated transport aircraft and runways to fly them to and from, severe logistical problems, and because the Luftwaffe was primarily a tactical air force, not a strategic one. First, even if Germany had 2000 additional aircraft it doesn't mean they could have used them at Stalingrad. They would require trained pilots, fuel, spare parts, maintenance crews, and air bases close enough for them to be in range of Stalingrad. All of these logistics were a growing problem for the 6th Army, and the Eastern Front in general, as a result of their pell-mell advance through the Russian Steppe towards the Volga and Caucus oil fields. Hitler made matters worth by meddling with the plan. Instead of concentrating on the oil fields, he split off the 4th and 6th Armies to attack Stalingrad. Then when the 6th Army attack was going well he ordered the 4th Army back south. Armies do not turn on a dime, and the resulting traffic jam slowed the German advance by a week. When it was sorted out, Hitler ordered the 4th right back to Stalingrad! All this indecision and splitting of armies made the logistical problems even worse. Unlike lighter and more nimble fighters, large, multi-engine, heavily loaded transport aircraft (and bombers pressed into the role) require long, finished runways for safe operations. Being heavily loaded their range would be reduced. Air dropped supply had not been practiced and often resulted in the supplies being scattered. The transports would have to land at a suitable airfield inside the pocket. While the Germans held seven airfields inside the pocket at the start of the encirclement, just one was suitable for heavy transports: Pitomnik. It did not have sufficient capacity to supply the 6th Army. The Soviets knew it and worked it over every chance they could. Aircraft attacked the airfield and the transports. The approaches were covered with anti-aircraft guns. By January 15th it was in artillery range and two days later was captured. The encircled troops required 750 tons of supplies minimum. The Luftwaffe was a tactical, not strategic, air force and had limited numbers of Ju 52 transports nor the organizational experience to pull off so large a sustained supply operation. Even with bombers pressed into service they could barely manage that. This lack of a true strategic capability would bite them both in the Battle of Britain, and in their lack of ability to strike at the Soviet rear. In addition, many of the types used in the Battle of Britain were no longer front line combat aircraft, or did not have the range to operate over the very long distances in the Eastern Front. The Bf 109 E was being replaced with later variants, plus the superior Fw 190. The long range destroyer concept of the Bf 110 didn't pan out and it was increasingly relegated to reconnaissance. The Do 17 was being replaced with the Ju 88. The most important aircraft from the Battle of Britain at Stalingrad would be the He 111, pressed into service as a capable fast transport. The other bomber pressed as a transport, the He 117 was introduced in 1942 two years after the Battle of Britain. The loss of 3000 experienced air crew was of larger concern than the loss of aircraft. Germany, planning for a short war, did not have a good system in place to train new pilots. Experienced pilots were not rotated back to train other pilots, they had to fly til they died. 

As for his rank... he's not a commissioned officer. Good Conduct stripes were only given to Privates and Corporals. He has no rank chevrons so he's not a Corporal. He's a Private. 

Any infantry advancing would be mowed down by concealed machine guns, and any tanks would be hit in the flank by concealed anti-tank weapons. Conventional assault by fire and movement did not work, there was no cover. This was eventually countered by combined arms. 

Why did the Soviets take so many more casualties than the Germans? To put it simply: because they could and the Germans couldn't and that was how they were going to win the war. It was a cold calculus that the Soviets could not match the Germans in tactics and training, but they could replace men and machines faster than the Germans could and they were going to use that to win. In 1941 that was not nearly enough. Soviet tactics and training were just too inferior, and there were too few of their modern equipment. Even then the sheer size of the Soviet army and scale of the Soviet Union slowed the Germans enough to survive, plus some stubborn resistance. With Soviet tactics and equipment always improving by late 1942 they had sufficiently closed the gap with the Germans to overmatch them. While at the Battle Of Kursk the Soviets lost tanks and guns at a rate of 3-to-1, but because they held the field they could recover and repair their vehicles while the German loses were gone forever. Through repairs and manufacturing the Soviets were back up to strength in a month, but for the Germans this was their final throw of the dice on the Eastern Front. The Germans could not replace the lost equipment fast enough to concentrate enough firepower for an offensive campaign on the scale needed on the Eastern Front and hold off the Allies in Italy and guard against an expected invasion somewhere between Southern France and Norway. The Soviets knew it. From now on the Germans would be fighting on the defensive. Note: the casualties of the Battle Of Kursk are often mixed in with the follow up Soviet counter-offensives Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev and Operation Kutuzov wherein the Soviets took very heavy casualties, particularly in armor. 

The Kubinka Tank Museum has examples of M3 Lee, M4 Sherman and M5 Honey American tanks. Whether they are Lend-Lease or battlefield salvage I do not know (I'm doubtful about the M5 as the US only sent 5 of them). They're painted rather generically. 

That said, I can think of a few wars which were "lost" (or "won" at very great cost) by the side with the "totalitarian weapons", and won by the side with the "fair weapons". Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939/40 Although this was fought by two professional national armies, there was a huge disparity in weaponry that I think makes it qualify. Russia had modern aircraft, artillery, and tanks in very large quantities, while Finland was mostly fighting with small arms and machine guns. Conventionally it should have been a walk over. While technically the Soviets "won" it took three months, and over 300,000 casualties. Finland remained free and the Soviets were humiliated. First Indochina War This would be the Viet Minh fighting their French colonial masters. The Viet Minh fought with mostly small arms and foot soldiers (later artillery) against a modern Western army, navy, and air force. The Viet Minh won. They got the French to leave. They got their own country. Soviet-Afghan War What started as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, requesting the assistance of the Soviet Union to put down an uprising by the Mujahideen turned into a full blown occupation of Afghanistan. A fully mechanized Cold War army went up against people wielding small arms and lost. (Only well into the war, 1986, did the Mujaheddin acquire modern weapons such as anti-air missiles.) New Zealand Wars A series of conflicts over several decades between the native Maori and the British/NZ government to enforce their version of the Treaty of Waitangi. The outnumbered Maori had muskets, shotguns, and melee weapons. The British had muskets, but also artillery and a navy. Lindybeige has a good video about the Battle of Gate Pah. While the Maori decisively "lost", taking heavy casualties and losing much land, like the Finns, they continued to exist. Their spirited resistance allowed them to escape the annihilation and total subjugation that befell most native peoples. 

This assumption is wrong. The US Mark 12 5"/38 caliber dual purpose (surface and aircraft) mount was the primary heavy AA armament facing kamikazes. It was mounted on nearly every US warship. It had a maximum elevation of 85° and could depress 15°. Even before kamikaze attacks or flying below radar, torpedo bombers had to attack at very low altitude and would often approach even lower to avoid detection only popping up to aim and release their torpedoes. Torpedo bombers were a huge threat and naval AA defenses were prepared to deal with them. 

This is a long-winded way to say that the German logistical situation was such that if not Stalingrad, it would have been somewhere else. In 1942 the Soviets could still afford to take large losses, while the Germans could barely hold onto what they had. The Soviets could hold back a million men for a counter-offensive, while the Germans had to use unreliable satellite armies. While losing Stalingrad would have been a blow to the Soviets, it would not have ended the war. The Germans would be past the Volga River with no natural barriers to stop them pushing further east, but where would they push to? The oil was to the south. Moscow was to the north. The Germans no longer had the forces to exploit such a strategic breakthrough. Instead, the Germans would have further stretched their lines, their logistics would have gotten even worse, their spearheads even more ragged, and the inevitable Soviet counter-offensive would have fallen on some other poorly defended flank.

There was no Chief Executive under the Articles Of Confederation because there was no executive. That was one of its major flaws that the US Constitution corrected. The Presidents of the Continental Congress were "presidents" in name only. They were appointed by Congress to act as a moderator, sort of like a modern Speaker of the House, but with just about no power. 

The conventional explanation is that this matches what happens when cattle dies and lies in the field for a few days. Blood pools in the lower parts of the body, or is consumed by insects. Eyes, tongue, and other soft tissue are eaten by blowflies and vultures. "Precise" cuts appear due to bloating or dehydration. No doubt this has been happening for as long as there have been cattle and ranchers chalked it up to cattle killed by predators. But in 1950s brought the UFO craze and now there was seemingly an explanation. Instead of looking for terrestrial explanations for odd occurrences, people began using extra-terrestrial ones. In the 1970s and 80s the UFO craze became increasingly exploited by books, television, and movies, some claiming to be documentaries, widening the public idea of a secret UFO invasion. Aliens aren't the only ones blamed. Cultists, long associated with ritual animal mutilation, also get the blame. The media created in the public mind an idea of secret satanic cults surrounding sensational murderers like Ricky Kasso, Son Of Sam, the Zodiac Killer, and Charles Manson. Some are genuine cultists, some are not. Some might have mutilated cattle, but nobody has been caught in the act. But this added to the public imagination more explanations for mutilated cattle. Cattle mutilation reached such a height in the US public consciousness that in 1974 the FBI was asked by the Senate to conduct an investigation citing numerous claims from ranchers of cattle mutilation. This investigation was completed in 1979 and concluded the cause was natural predators, plus some unexplained anomalies. An alternative explanation is money. The aforementioned FBI report said 8,000 "mutilations" in Colorado cost ranchers an estimated million dollars. If this was due to natural causes, or the rancher's negligence, the ranchers are out. If this is due to a government cover up or cultists, maybe they can get compensated! It's not necessarily a sensible idea, but one can see the psychological lure: "it's not my fault, there's a government conspiracy"! 

Article 7 of the US Constitution A unanimous vote gives every state effective veto power over the whole enterprise risking deadlock over each state's various pet issues. This gives an individual state disproportionate bargaining power to extract concessions from the rest. Under the Articles of Confederation most decisions required unanimous approval by the states and that wasn't working out so well. The US Constitutional Convention began as an attempt to fix the problems in the Articles of Confederation. But when Rhode Island refused to send delegates that became impossible, a unanimous vote to amend the Articles was impossible. The prospect of Rhode Island also vetoing the US Constitution was very real. New York was also very tepid to the idea, two of their three delegates left early leaving only Alexander Hamilton. Vetoing the new Constitution meant everyone goes back to the Articles of Confederation, an outcome some states might be willing to risk, and the union stays together... for now. By making it a two-thirds vote, no state could hold the rest hostage with their individual demands, a big problem under the Articles. Once ratified, the ratifying states could move ahead under the new Constitution while the hold outs would be left out in the cold. While the necessary two-thirds was achieved on June 21, 1788, the Congress of the Confederation waited until March 4, 1789 to begin proceedings under the new Constitution. This allowed time for the holdouts time to join which Virginia and New York swiftly did, though by narrow votes. As the holdouts shared no borders, the Articles Of Confederation would be effectively dead. The holdouts would be under increasing pressure to ratify to regain the benefits of union with the other states. The alternative would be to become individual countries. While New York or Virginia might consider that, it would put immense pressure on tiny Rhode Island. However, this almost backfired. Even ratifying the promised Bill Of Rights didn't bring Rhode Island into the fold. It was the US threatening a trade embargo that finally pushed them over the edge, the prospect of having no land-based trade and hostile neighbors on all sides was too much. They voted for ratification on May 29, 1790 by a narrow 34-to-32 vote.
