What is happiness or pleasure??? Depending on the answer, you question can be either meaningful or meaningless. Philosophers have offered at least four different answers. 

As a parent, I was often presented with similar arguments from my kids. I can see at least two fallacies in the scenario, depending on interpretations: equivocation and denying the antecedent. Equivocation The argument is based on the ambiguous construal of the content of choice. For the parents, the content of choice is this: "Clean your room or else (some sort of punishment would ensue)!" The child however construes the choice as follows: "I clean my room ( = I get $50: To her, cleaning implies a monetary compensation as she believes that all unvoluntary labors must be compensated) or I do not clean my room (= I exercise my free will)." Since the child understands the content of her choice in this way, she rightfully complains that she is in dilemma: "Either I clean my room (in this case, her cleaning action lacks free will since her work without the remuneration is forced) or I do not clean my room (in this case, her exercising her free will will be construed as disobedience). If the parents explain what is the content of the choice for the child, she would realize that she does have a choice after all. Denying the antecedent Upon hearing "Clean your room," the child permissibly translates the sentence into a disjunctive form. "Either I don't get $50 or I clean the room." (disjunction introduction). The disjunctive form is equivalent to the following conditional: "If I get $50, then I clean the room." The child did not get $50. Thus the child concludes that she does not clean the room. The child's reasoning however commits the fallacy of denying the antecedent. 

Since the questioner sounds confused about Hume's contribution on causality, I would like to offer a little background first. The story should begin with Descartes. After the process of Cartesian skepticism, Descartes concludes that we must be born with some ideas. That is, some ideas are not the outcome of empirical acquisition and must have been imprinted in our mind prior to any experience. Descartes enumerates God, substance, causality as some examples of innate ideas. This tradition of believing in innate ideas is called Continental Rationalism by historians of philosophy. Now, British empiricists thought the continental postulate of innate ideas BS, as Locke famously responded the postulate with the doctrine of tabula rasa. Berkeley got rid of extensional substance with Esse est percipi. It is Hume who got rid of causation as an innate idea. For this, Hume partitioned the relationships among ideas into two categories: analytic and synthetic. Analytic knowledge obtains by pure examinations of the relationship among ideas: '2+3=5' or "A white swan is a swan" is an example. Synthetic knowledge obtains when we test our ideas by experiences: e.g., "Swans are beautiful." To Hume, we cannot know causation (cause and effect) by purely examining the relationship among ideas: e.g., we cannot get the idea of smoke from the idea of fire. So casualty is not analytic. So it must be synthetic, and when we examine our experiences relating causality, all we got are proximity in location, temporal concurrence, and constant conjunction. Thus Hume concluded that the thought that the world events are governed by a causal chain is a projection of human psychology. 

Since you set up your question with X being God’s view, you probably have the idea that there is no meta-language Y above X, but rather that X actually contains the entire hierarchy of languages all the way up. This is also legitimate in standard treatments of formal languages. Frames of references are usually formalized as sets in set theory. There is no set of all sets, but we can still talk about the class of all sets without any problems. The only issue is that the class of all sets is not a set and therefore is not part of any of the object languages in the hierarchy. So again questions about X (the class of all sets) can not be written in the language, so they are actually unaskable in addition to being unanswerable. 

A model provides an interpretation for every (non-logical) term in the language. The following are the non-logical terms that need interpretation: 

If the question is about non-formalized natural language, then there is no problem with allowing X (God’s frame of reference) to contain X. For example, we can talk about “everything”, which includes the concept of “everything”, without problems. We only have paradoxes resulting when we treat language and the objects language refers to formally. 

The argument assumes that there are only two kinds of worlds relating to existence (your first premise): the world composed of mutable things, and the world composed of immutable things (Forms). But it is possible to think of a world that shares some properties of the world of the Form, but not all. Some philosophers of mathematicians, for example, believe that mathematical entities are intelligible and immutable, but their mode of existence is different from that of the Form (e.g., structuralism and Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for mathematical realism). That is, it is possible that there are more than two worlds relating to existence, and that the soul belongs to a third world. In this case, the fact that the soul shares some properties of the Form does not warrant the conclusion that the soul shares all the properties of the Form, specifically, the property of immortality. 

The base rate fallacy and the confusion of the inverse fallacy are not the same. The base rate fallacy is related to base rate, so let’s first clear about base rate. Base rate is an unconditional (or prior) probability that relates to the feature of the whole class or set. These are examples of the base rate: the probability that a randomly chosen person is an Asian in California is 13% ($URL$ the admission rate of Stanford is 5% ($URL$ The base rate fallacy is committed when a person arrives at a conclusion without taking consideration of the base rate. So if someone says, “Only 5% of applicants make it into Stanford University, but my daughter is brilliant! So she will certainly be accepted by the school." However smart his daughter is, given the extremely low acceptance rate, the person’s optimism is unwarranted as it ignores the base rate. Confusion of the Inverse Fallacy is related to misunderstanding conditional probabilities. The conditional probability of A given B is different from the conditional probability of B given A, mathematically. 

Since your question refers to a frame of reference Y which is necessarily outside the frame of reference X, I assume that you are asking about formal systems. You are correct that this is exactly how formal systems are typically set up in order to avoid problems such as Russell’s paradox. As Not_Here points out in the comments, Y is the “meta-language” of the formal system, while X is the “object language”. Y can also be treated as an object language by a higher level meta-language Z, and this hierarchy goes up forever. In this framework, your “unanswerable question”, which I take to be “Where is the truth of X derived from?”, is not only unanswerable but also unaskable. That is, the question is not well-formed within the object language for X. Viewed in this way, your unanswerable question is similar to the liar’s paradox, which analyzes the sentence “This sentence is false.” If that sentence is true, then it must be false (because it says so), and if it is false, then it must be true (because it is false that it is false), so we have a contradiction. The solution is that the truth of any sentence in the object language X can only be asserted or denied in the meta-language Y. 

Being a bulldog is not necessary for being a dog, thus the definition, "bulldogs are dogs" is indeed a too-wide definition. 

Topics relating to the question are not neatly partitioned due to the involvement of complex fields and perspectives (e.g., contribution from mathematics and computer science to logic). Risking over-generalization, this is how differences among the three fields can be understood. Logic is like the tools in the shed; philosophical logic is using the tools to better understand problems arising in philosophy; and philosophy of logic is to ask how the tools became tools proper. Let me elaborate. Logic: We want to understand how our ideas relate to each other. Natural languages are defective for this purpose. 'Morning star' and 'evening star,' e.g., have different ideas, although they refer to the same thing. So invented are propositional logic, first-order logic, and second order logic as tools to inquire relationships among ideas. Philosophical logic: Some philosophers realize that logic can help sharpen important concepts in their fields. For example, philosophers of mind or of knowledge or of language ask "What does it mean to know or to believe something?"; "What does it mean for something to be possible or necessary?"; and "How to change our minds rationally (belief revision)?" So invented are epistemic logic, modal logic, and defeasible logic, respectively. Philosophy of logic: Logicians wonder how the tools in the shed became tools. Surely, in a Flatland, a shovel would not have been a tool. Thus, the tools themselves became the object of study. For example, logicians ask "How this object came to exist as a tool?; "What logical approach would have been possible, had we understood logical particles (e.g., logical connectives and quantifiers) differently?: "What do we mean by the truth of a logical statement? Studies or topics relevant to answer these questions, respectively, are history of logic; Hilbert's axiomatic approach vs. Gentzen's natural deduction approach; correspondence theory of truth vs. deflationary theory of truth. 

Through the famous Cartesian skepticism, Descartes concludes that the world is composed of two substances: res cogitans and res extensa. Res cogitans means thinking things, like consciousness, mind, or spirit. Res extensa means things that extend or occupy space. Material things in the world belong to the substance of res extensa. Descartes asserts that almost all things in the world are purely res extensia, governed by the causal law. To him, a dog is just a causal machine. A crying dog, then, is nothing but a whining gear. The only exception to him is human beings. To Descartes, human begins are made out of both thinking and extending substances. I, for instance, am composed of body (the materiel thing) and mind (the immaterial thing). This view of human beings can be called Cartesian dualism. By positing that human beings are made of the two kinds of substance, Descartes ended up creating a problem. By definition, substance exists on its own right. So the thinking being and the extending being do not need each other, but they surely look like interacting with each other from my own experiences. My mind tells my body to exercise, but my body says it is too tired. I feel that I am just one whole person. If substance is defined by the way Descartes stipulates, how the interaction between them is possible? This question is called the mind-body problem, which has made the minds of philosophers busy even to the present time (under the topic of philosophy of mind). Responding to your question, as Vimaior aptly put it, interactionism is a family of thinking (category) that aims to solve the mind-body problem. Viewed in this light, Cartesian dualism can be said as his own particular answer since Descartes solves the problem by positing that the two substances interact in the pineal gland. His solution is far from satisfactory since the question is not where, but how. Descartes' solution is contrasted by Malebranche's occasionalism and Leibnniz's pre-established harmony theory in history of philosophy. Malebranche argued that God is the one that enables the interaction in every occasion of causation between mind and body. Leibniz maintained God already knew that my mind wanted to scratch my nose at this moment so he arranged their interaction far ahead of time. 

This post is to answer your EDIT 2 question. Your confusion is legitimate since p.45 is indeed very confusing. I am not sure whether the fault is in me, in translation, or in Frege. Due to the unclarity of the text, to answer your question, I extrapolate stuff I learned about Frege’s work in graduate school. On page 45, Frege is in pain to explain the distinction between the sense and denotation of a sentence when it is used in indirect speech. Earlier in the paper, Frege posited that the sense of a sentence is the proposition, and the reference of a sentence is its truth value. One objection to Frege’s posit comes from the use of a sentence in an indirect speech. The objection goes like this. If the reference of a sentence is its truth value (= thus is objective and unchanging), then we should be able to substitute one true statement with another true statement freely. But in an indirect speech (i.e., when a sentence is used as a subordinate noun clause, like I think that …(called a propositional attitude)), the free substitute is impossible, since the truth value of the whole sentence can change as exemplified in the Lois Lane case. Thus implausible is the posit that the reference of a sentence is its truth value. Frege’s response to this objection is to distinguish between the direct sense and the indirect sense of a sentence. The direct sense of a sentence is the stand alone meaning of the sentence, i.e, the proposition; thus its reference is its truth value. The indirect sense of a sentence is its meaning to the subject of the main clause (= thought). Due to this distinction, when a sentence is used in an indirect speech, one should ask whether the sentence is used directly or indirectly. If the sentence is used directly, i.e., as a proposition, then its reference is its truth value. Thus you can substitute without harming the truth value of the whole sentence. This is the context where Frege states what you cite:
