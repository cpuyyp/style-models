He is also directly involved in many occurrences throughout the books that involve his dealing death, so the appellation is appropriate. His "signature piece" is his hook, which replaces one of his hands. Spoilers: 

I am currently in the middle of Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. Twice thus far, he mentioned a manuscript that he brought with him to Auschwitz, and lost there. When he first arrives in camp, and the prisoners' belongings are confiscated: 

The chorus of Imagine Dragons' "Thief" (from the deluxe version of the album Smoke + Mirrors), written by Clare Reynolds and Natalie Maree Dunn, goes like this: 

In chapter 3 of Season of Mists (The Sandman #24), there are three creatures shown guarding the gates of Dream's palace (left). The lion refers to the whole group as "Gatekeepers" (p 20-21). 

As you mentioned, there are basically two ways to interpret that last paragraph. The bride's speechlessness can either indicate that she has become "choked up" about her mother's thoughtfulness, or it can tell us that she is upset at her mother for offering this gift. After reading the story again more closely, I believe that she is upset at her mother. Here are two reasons why: 

I assume that, when used as a noun, the word refers to devils. I don't understand what Tassie is trying to get at here. As far as I could tell, the meaning of this PS is not clarified in later points of the book (contrary to the assurance at the end of the message). At this point in the story (after a good number of letters are illegal, before people are allowed to use similar-sounding letters in their place), people often used less common synonyms instead of words that contain "illicitabeticals." It is likely, then, that "Mephistophelians" will stand in for "devils" or "demons" (D is a forbidden letter at this point, along with B, F, J, K, Q, and Z), but I don't know to whom, in particular, Tassie refers. It might be the Island High Council, the island rebels, or something more abstract. I don't either know why these devils belong in the Orient. This could be a reference to island geography (although I'm not sure why it would be necessary to replace "east" with "Orient") or to something outside the novel. 

The SEA is Ours is this month's topic challenge. The purpose of these challenges is to increase the diversity of the literature that we discuss on this site. This is important for a number of reasons, among them to increase our understanding of cultures other than our own. Therefore, I'd like to ask if the stories from The SEA is Ours accurately portray South-East Asian culture. I have little to no prior experience with SEA culture, and want to ensure that I'm getting a correct picture from the stories of this anthology (whenever my copy arrives). I understand that culture isn't static, and that part of writing SEA characters and culture into a steampunk world necessitates the creation of something new; however, I imagine that an effort was made to preserve the essence of SEA culture and society in the brave new steampunk world(s) of this collection. If that effort falls short in some manner, I'd like to be alerted about it in advance so that I don't come to misunderstand the culture under discussion. While an argument could be made that if "SEA authors are writing SEA steampunk, then it would be difficult for it to not in some way be an authentic representation of SEA culture," I know that other efforts by members of a given culture to explain parts of that culture have fallen short in different ways. (See, for example, this part of a conversation in chat regarding Chamorro culture.) I suppose that the best answers to this question will come from those who have both read the book, and are familiar enough with SEA culture to point to things that were done correctly (or not). Answers that quote reviews from South-East Asians describing the accuracy of the stories are also acceptable. (I had a conversation about this in chat which may be of use to potential answerers.) 

*I was going to correct a typo in your question, but then found that the typo was also present in the original -- the question actually does state that "This element can cannot be justified on rational grounds." You may be better served using other study material. I haven't really thought about your other question much, but many of the commenters there posit that all the choices for some of those questions are wrong. Good luck. 

I assume that the final line of the stanza refers to Samson; however, I'm not sure what Samson has to do with "Hallelujah." Using a Bible search engine, I could not find an instance where Samson's name (שמשון) appeared with the word "Hallelujah" (הללויה). I could not either find the name שמשון in Psalms (although it's possible that one or more Psalms are attributed to Samson; I don't know Psalms or the commentaries on it well enough to say). There's certainly nothing in the story of Delilah with the word "Hallelujah." The word does not appear in II Samuel 11 (nor, actually, in the entire book). So, my questions are: 

So we see that while Dream didn't originally care about individuals, by the time of his most recent meeting with Hob Gadling, he had developed the ability to call a human "friend," along with the ability to recognize and care for an individual member of humanity. (This may be related to Dream's 70-year imprisonment.) This is important to the later parts of The Doll's House, because although Dream clearly cares about his job and is engaged in protecting the dreaming well-being of large populations, he previously didn't care much about individual lives -- this was what allowed him to kill a vortex without pause. However, when Rose's turn comes to die at Dream's hand, he delays. Even though he knows who and what Rose is, he makes no move against her (and even goes out of his way to preserve her life) until she begins to cause problems in the Dreaming. Even then, he pauses to explain to her why she must die (and Rose even complains that he talks to much -- "Forchrissakes! Look, just do it. Stop apologizing and just do whatever you're going to do. Okay? Just do it."1) An argument might be made that this is part of what caused Dream's reluctance to end Rose's life. And a reader would be entirely unaware of this part of Dream's struggle without having watched the evolution of Dream's relationship with individuals over the course of the centuries in "Men of Good Fortune." 

In chapter 1* of On Writing, King says that Carrie White was based on two girls that he knew from high school. All the details mentioned in the question are there, but not in those exact words. It is likely that Wikipedia's source for their quote is Secret Windows. muru has left a comment with a link to a website with the exact quote, attributed to an interview of King in the April 1981 issue of the Twilight Zone magazine. 

So the second line of the second stanza was changed to be more specific, and the final line was changed for the rhyme. However, I'm not sure why the penultimate line was altered; I had originally assumed that it was changed after the founding of the State of Israel (after all, it doesn't make sense to speak of a "return" to a land in which you currently reside). If The Times of Israel is accurate, though, and that change was also made in 1905, it was 43 years prior to Israel's independence. Why was the penultimate line of "HaTikvah" altered? 

Colfer's The Supernaturalist has blue "energetic monster creatures" called "Parasites" that only very few humans can see. These monsters appear to exploit humans, sucking out their life force. 

To set the scene: the friends discover the meaning of the letters R.A.B., and then cautiously set out to find what they can from Regulus' room. They can assume that he was not their friend because of his lineage (I don't recall whether they knew at this point that he was once a Death Eater), but then Harry finds something interesting: 

There has been lively discussion about whether or not witches and wizards in the world of Harry Potter wear trousers under their robes (for example, in this tweet). I have not yet seen a definitive answer to this question online, though I have seen theories thrown around based on certain passages or statements by Rowling (like this one). Is there any evidence in HP canon that wizards did/did not wear trousers under their robes? 

I have no information about Keown's life, but I can make a guess based on a close reading of the poem. I think this poem is addressed to the narrator's son. 

While discussing this question in chat, Gallifreyan mentioned that he had wondered about the significance of Hob Gadling, arguably the protagonist of "Men of Good Fortune." We both mentioned our pet theories (Gallifreyan's: as a foil to Morpheus; mine: to show how Dream's relationship with humanity changes over time), and that got me thinking about how I might answer that question should Gallifreyan choose to ask it. But what if "Men of Good Fortune" was included in The Doll's House precisely to develop these characteristics of Dream? I posit that it is necessary to develop these pieces of Dream's character for the ending of The Doll's House. Let me explain: In order to understand why Dream is so conflicted in killing Rose Walker, it's necessary to first establish that he cares for humanity not only generally, but also that he cares for individuals. At the start of "Men of Good Fortune," Morpheus is rather detached from humanity, and his older sister attempts to make him feel more for individuals: 

You're close with your interpretation, here, but I think it needs a slight change to be perfect. I don't think this only means that he has always gotten away with "sailing close to the wind" without consequence. To draw a line means to make a limit for yourself -- to tell yourself that I'll drive 5 miles over the speed limit, but not 30. In this statement, the speaker is saying that they don't really have any self-imposed limits. 

3: Conclusion The colors that are associated with Vin and Elend represent their initial states. At the beginning of the series, Vin was simply a girl of the streets, and a warrior. This violent, Ruin-linked nature is represented by her dark clothes. When we first meet Elend, he was only a gentle-natured highborn scholar; something that is very easily connected to the white color of Preservation. Ultimately, however, Vin and Elend are both able to discover and reconcile the multipartite aspects of their personalities into a cohesive whole, in the same manner that Ruin and Preservation are joined, through Sazed, into Harmony. 

As an aside (and this is not really a part of the answer), I think that some more thought is needed regarding the exact objection the bride has to the new necklace. Is it merely, as she claims, that she is already wearing a necklace? I read this paragraph that the narrating bride doesn't want the new necklace because she's wearing Gramma's necklace, specifically. Gramma's necklace is connected to something older, perhaps a tradition, and the bride does not want to give that up in exchange for a new necklace from her mother. 

If it helps, I think the search that finally produced this result was "novel about night shift hotel clerk." 

I might be wrong, but as I see no other order to this list, I think that the first description ("A maiden aunt") belongs to the woman who makes her bed in the first gable, and the second to the second etc. There is a certain amount of support for this throughout the story; for example, when the women of the house bury Marigold's third child (the one from the woman who makes her bed in the first gable), it would seem appropriate that the minister's wife would suggest a religious activity for the funeral. 

- Ella Minnow Pea (First Anchor Books Edition, October 2002), page 128 (paperback) "Mephistophelian" was one of the words I learned from this book. According to FreeDictionary.org, the word is an adjective, and means 

If many people can be friends with someone simply because they attended a school that they did, I can understand that Harry can relate to and start to feel good feelings toward someone who was also a Hogwarts Seeker. After this preparation, they are now ready to hear Kreacher's testimony, now ready to accept Regulus as the good guy that he was. 

She also takes up reading and studying, spending more time than perhaps necessary studying the Alendi's journal, and taking extensive notes about it. She studies the Deepness as well. Vin eventually becomes Preservation, and gives up her life to destroy Ruin. Her final, and perhaps defining act was a major one on the side of Preservation. However, more important was her ability to accept that both parts of her identity are equally valid. Here, at the end of a lengthy internal monologue (ch. 32): 

I can't say whether this is a thing in Christian theology as well (I assume the Seed-Merchant was Christian), but the Jewish faith requires one to bless God for things that appear to be bad, as well as for good things. (Although the blessing said is phrased differently from one that's said after something obviously good happens.) 

Gaiman, Neil. "Ragnarok: The Final Destiny of the Gods." Norse Mythology. New York: W.W. Norton, 2017. p 272. The Einherjar themselves might also be classified as zombies, because they also returned from the dead, but they don't really feel zombie-esque because they're on the home team. 

After writing the question, I Googled around a bit more, and found that the pieces of the manuscript were used to write Man's Search for Meaning. 

ibid., p 273. I haven't read any other Norse mythology to date, so I take him at his word that he is faithful to the original myths. Wikipedia cites a similar claim to Jesse Byock's 2005 translation of Prose Edda. This is not earlier than Gilgamesh, but as the Prose Edda was compiled circa 1220 CE (per Wikipedia), it's certainly earlier than Twain.
