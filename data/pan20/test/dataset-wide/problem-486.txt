I would try reinstalling the drive side and non drive side cups to the frame (to keep the spindle centered). Then I would recommend a game of whack-a-mole on the spindle with a rubber mallet. I have often had to remove a crankset this way. A rubber mallet should be in pretty much any home mechanics tool kit. The rubber mallet has almost no chance of damaging the spindle. Provided you don't smash/dent your frame with it, it should be fine. With the cups on tightly and nondrive side crank off, you may also try rocking the drive side crank arm back and forth some as you rubber mallet the spindle. 

Inertial systems like the brain have been around for several decades, however, Specialized is probably to the first company to do them light (ish), mass produced and marketed. The real question is not "how good is it?" (is does work), but "do you want/need it as a rider?" I worked at a Specialized shop for sometime, and opinions on the brain seem to vary. I know several riders that swear by them as one of the most awesome things ever, but also people didn't feel like it was needed or just couldn't tell the difference. Personally, I always felt like they added a bit of efficiency, but since I rarely rode trails that benefited from it, and that I didn't MTB race, it wasn't really necessary for me. The brains "automagikness" isn't necessarily standard in the price range, however easily adjustable suspension is. In that range you'll find most suspension has some sort of quick adjustment knob or switch to vary the performance of the shock. Such systems will likely weigh less, but require rider input. It should be all about your riding style. If the trails you frequent don't require suspension adjustment "on the fly", the brain will likely just be extra weight. If they do, but you don't want to deal with flipping a knob or switch, and you like the way it feels, it may be for you. 

Yes. It's possible. Newly laced wheels often have "flat spots" where the rim is out of round. Generally you round and dish the wheel before you start trueing it. It's possible that the wheel has a flat spot that you are feeling. However, there are another possibilities to include bad tyre mounting, improperly secured wheel (axle), bad tyre and assorted drive train issues. It may be best to have a mechanic or experienced home maintainer check it out. 

After many years of riding in foul weather, I rarely use overshoes for above freezing temperatures. They are NEVER waterproof. The opening for your cleat and heel allows water into the setup which inevitably makes it's way up to your ventilated upper. For them to actually be waterproof, they would need to seal to the bottom sole of your shoe. Additionally, the cleat attachment area of your shoe would need to be waterproof (many are not). More than occasional walking tends to wear them prematurely. I've owned several brands and never had a set make it through more than three seasons (fall, spring and perhaps part of another fall) before they are coming apart at the seams. Several companies make foul weather shoes. They range from truly insulated winter boots to versions of the companies regular offerings with no ventilation holes and a sealed bottom around the cleat area. I've had several pairs of these from various companies and all have lasted longer than 4 seasons (2 years). In my opinion overshoes are only appropriate as an insulation layer when it's too cold to be wet or when you are a pro doing a time trial and they extra 0.75 seconds they afford are worth it (they are free from your sponsor at that point anyway). 

Theoretically, you could shorten your chain to accommodate the smaller (largest gear) cassette. However, I never install a new cassette unless I install a new chain as well. Cassettes and chains tend to "wear" to one another and one can sometimes encounter difficulty if you don't. That "could" be the issue with your new chain. If the old chain was run past it's proper service life and damaged the cassette, no new chain is going to work well with it. Depending how many miles/hours you put on the new chain, if you put a new cassette on your rig and leave the "new" chain, it could be fine. However, there are many other issues that could cause slippage. A stiff link in the new chain if it was twisted/damaged during installation would be a prime example. 

Look for a company that will rent you a real van. You can get like 10 bikes and gear in a Chevy Express or GMC Savana with the seats removed. I can get easily get 4 or five bikes in the back of my Savana and still have room for other stuff. 

What he hammered down is the star nut. It's a gription (yes I made that word up) device that serves as an anchor point in the steer tube to allow the top cap to properly compress the headset during a headset adjustment. Old or damaged star nuts are often driven all the way through the steer tube to remove them (that's why your steer tube is open at the bottom). They are generally only hammered in a short ways because being longer serves no purpose. In this case, so long as that GPS unit is as stiff as a steel bolt and allows for proper compression during an adjustment, it should be fine. 

Either of these styles of pedals should be purchasable for about the same, or less than a new pair of shoes, and should likely last longer than any cycling specific shoe. 

If you are doing exercises that cause pain in your knee, it generally could mean one of two things, your mechanics are bad and putting strain on your joint, or your joint hasn't seen such hard use and the tendons, ligaments and joint capsule aren't adapted to such use. Since it sounds like you strength train regularly, I'd guess you have a mechanics issue. You may want to look at your saddle height as well as the setup and type of pedal you are using. While many more experienced riders prefer a large amount of float in their pedals (the play before a pedal will unclip) I found that less float keeps my knees in a better position and reduces the problems I have with mine. Between that and a different cleat adjustment a few years back, I have greatly reduced the strain my knees feel while riding long distances. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend my same setup to you (or anyone), I would point you at your mechanics/bike fit first. It may be very easy to make some simple adjustments and provide your knees with a better position (for them). 

Genital protection is rarely (if ever) used in cycling because it generally means putting some kind of hard surface in play (or excessive padding). Either of these can easily lead to some very uncomfortable chaffing problems. For less "pedalcentric" disciplines this might be acceptable (flatland, downhill, etc). But, for the rest of the market there just isn't a benefit to loss ratio to justify it. Many other sports have genital protection equipment that is used regularly. Like winter cyclists who have to use mountaineering equipment to stay warm, you may have to dip into some other sports equipment cache to accomplish / try what you are suggesting. 

It depends entirely on what your are trying to accomplish and what your expectations are. Many RAAM riders opt for a TT style setup, so don't let the long distance dissuade based on "it's not done" that way, because it is (by some riders). A large consideration may be parts and maintenance. Most traditional touring bikes opt for simpler parts that are easy to repair or find replacements for. I saw a guy attempt a similar thing on a TT bike starting up north on the Haul Road and planning to finish in South America. He crashed soon into his ride and needed a new derailleur hanger and bar end shifter for his fancy bike. Since the hanger wasn't available in town (direct from manufacturer part) our mechanic had to fabricate him a hanger out of scrap. For the shifter, nothing (within reasonable expense) could be done. He was forced to call ahead to a shop in Canada and hope they could get one ordered and available by the time he got there, then ride without it for several hundred miles. Also, from commentary from links on another answer, tire selection may be impacted. Depending on the rear tolerances on your TT bike, your selection of tires may be limited to less than desirable tires for touring. The point being that TT bikes tend toward extreme specialization and part styles that aren't often carried in stock. As long as you are aware, careful, bring your own second TT bike, or comfortable with the possible delays (or some combination of the 4) it may be fine. 

This largely depends on rider goals and finances. Your example clearly highlights the advantage of a light bike (although aero is probably equally important). If Joe and Billy are racing, and they are exactly the same, we can assume Billy is going to win. If Joe can afford it, and wants to stay competitive with Billy, it will likely be worth it for him. If Joe and Billy are non-competitive and just riding for fun, Billy likely isn't going to ride at a high level to make it a sufferfest for Joe (unless Joe is into that sort of thing). You may also be missing the fact that Billy is recovering (a bit) while waiting. Whether or not this is a "sufferfest" for Joe is sort of irrelevant. Joe may enjoy training pain. Regardless, because of equipment, Joe has a lower level of upper performance than Billy. 

You should be concerned yes, because wet feet are not happy feet. However, this is something your shoe manufacturer should have taken care of. I have owned Specialized and Lake brands of waterproof shoes. I have not ever had problems with water entering through the cleat holes of either (I have owned A LOT of Lake boots). However, that doesn't mean your manufacturers have the same care. You could call to inquire, or better yet, test. It should be easy to stopper a sink and put the footbed below the waterline to see what happens. Testing one's equipment is a great way to build confidence in it. 

I'd ask first what's wrong with just wearing the packs? If they were adventure racing long distances, I'd say get the bags on the bike for sure. But for commuting, I've always found a backpack to be superior. It's easier to balance a heavy load since the weight can be moved dynamically with you. Additionally there is not fiddling with a rack or panniers at your destination, and low likelihood of forgetting you pack on your bike. As long as the pack is not so large (above the shoulders) that a helmet can still be worn with the head upright, I've never had a problem riding short distances, even with fairly heavy backpack. 

This is a hard question to answer without narrowing down the question. The question is very similar to "What's the best bike for me?" There are several different designs (frame) for doing suspension. Then there are several different types of suspension (coil, air, elastomer, oil, material, etc). Just like the different frame designs have strengths and weaknesses, the different shock/suspension types do as well. Finally there is riding style and preference. None of that even takes into account the vastly different feels than can be accomplished on one bike now through suspension setup (tuning preload, return, etc). If you took a very small travel suspension setup designed to be extremely light and responsive for XC racing (for example) and tried it off some drops and ledges, assuming you didn't damage it, you'd probably be disappointed with the feel for the cost. Just as a good bike should be designed with a set of riding circumstances in mind, so should be suspension. That XC rig might be worth $10K and worthy of a World Cup XC race, but if you decided to try it as an urban progressive bike or downhill rig, you are going to (likely) break it and/or be disappointed. Similarly, if you took a $10K World Cup Downhill rig and tried to commute on it, or ride it on a XC style trail or course, it's going to feel like an unresponsive pig and wear you out. In short, the best that you could hope to do was test a suspension setup on a trail, course or conditions you plan to ride and see how it feels. Even then you'll likely need to make adjustments and such to get the setup right for a particular trail/course/staircase. 

I would generally default to the drive direction indicated on the side wall of the tire. I know folks that run tires opposite of that recommendation for specific reasons (traction gains at the cost of rolling resistance), but generally, the manufacturer knows what they are doing when they put that arrow on the sidewall. 

I would check the SRAM grip shift that you purchased. SRAM makes grift shifters for both their own derailleurs and Shimano's. The actuation ratio on those shifters is different. SRAM uses a 1:1 ratio for their high end stuff. Most of Shimano's is closer to 2:1. The SunRace website you linked to lists the M40 as 2:1, meaning you'll need a SRAM grip shifter with 2:1 actuation. 

Wheels generally come in a cardboard box with plastic caps over the hub ends to protect them and a bit of other padding (for skewers and the like) added in. Your LBS may have a few of these laying around for whatever size wheel you are sending back. They may even be willing to do the package job for you and save you a bit of time for a reasonable amount of money. If you just want the materials, I have known some shops to simply give them away (especially to known customers). The stresses a wheel endures in a cardboard box during shipping are less than what they would endure properly installed on a bike. Any damage more than that would completely destroy the cardboard box and be evident as a shipping mishap. I recommend insurance from your shipper to protect against such mishaps. 

I stopped trying to use glasses/goggles long ago and have gotten away with it because we rarely have wind here when it gets cold. However, I have started using a Cold Avenger when the temperature drops below 0F. I find that it saves my lungs on long rides. After looking at their advertising, it is supposed to keep goggles/glasses from fogging as well (directs your exhalations away). I've tried my sunglasses a few times with my mask and had no fogging with it. 

For AM and FR (All Mountain and FreeRide) style riding, a strong upper torso is a huge improvement. Like your lower body, you want a lot of it to be endurance as well as strength. Keeping the front end straight and using your arms like shock absorbers as much as your legs will eventually take it's toll. I have been on many a mountain bike ride in the spring after hours of snow riding in the winter (much closer to road riding) and had arms that were totally shot after only an hour or so while my legs were still quite fresh. My personal feeling is that my shoulders and arms (uppers and forearms) seemed to be suffering the worst. One of the main overlooked advantages of a strong upper body is being able to pump (like a pump track) while mountain riding to maintain speed. I've seen strong BMX kids roll multiple laps around a pump track without pedaling at all, while a competitive road guy barely made a lap before his arms gave out. Much of that can be translated to trail riding where you can use your upper body to extend your legs. 

As someone who uses their rear brake far more than their front, I feel qualified to answer this. My normal riding style (for better or worse) is rear brake heavy on my winter bikes. I have a tendency to allow my front wheel to track and lock/drag/skid my rear wheel when cornering on snow. I am very comfortable with my rear wheel sliding and to some extent, riding sideways. Sheldon Brown has a section on when rear braking is appropriate. Basically, slippery surfaces (8 months of the year here in the beautiful sub arctic desert that is Fairbanks, Alaska), front flats, during bumpy sections, and front brake failure. That being said rear wheel braking is really only effective (in my opinion) if you are going to take advantage of breaking the tire loose. And if you aren't comfortable with that, it's probably not for you.
