I move the pin tip up-down, but entire chain is rotating (even if I grab it with my hand). I could hold still chain with another pliers but I am afraid of damaging the link I would hold with pliers. So what tool is required to break it off, and how to do it? 

Before you answer: no matter what bike I would change tires to 2" slick front, 2" semi-slick rear, so in other words, tires in this question does not play role (now I have 26" MTB and I use 2.35" to get the desired effect). I am looking for three things: 

So you get (translating into English -- you can have width 1" narrower than with 26" tires to get the same effect of rolling over holes). Crossing obstacles Another assumption -- when we hit an obstacle only pressure is changed, and the force from the tire material is negligible. Not even going to formula for force of changing pressure of the air, it is sufficient to notice we are not seeking the formula, we are seeking the same effect for 26" and 28". So the only factor that matters here is the volume of the tires -- it has to be identical to get identical effect. Volume of torus: , here is half of the width of the tire, and R is half of the size of the wheel. 

I'm considering a Rohloff hub and am wondering what the day-to-day riding experience would be like compared to my existing derailleur setup. There are some obvious things (e.g. don't have to be moving to shift), but what I'm most interested is the less obvious things. In other words, can someone give a more or less complete enumeration of how riding a Rohloff hub is similar and different than derailleur(s)? I live in the boonies and so it might be difficult try one out before purchase. Understanding what may be different will help me prioritize this try-out. 

My question is: where can I find something that will screw into the threads in the base of the pump and somehow lead to a modern Presta pump head? 

Some years ago, I changed to Presta valves; for this I needed a new head. I got a Topeak SmartHead Bicycle Floor Pump Upgrade Kit, which is a replacement head and hose with a number of different adapters. Unfortunately, none of them fit this pump, so I just hacked off most of the worn-out stock hose and spliced in the Topeak hose (one of the adapters is designed for this). Every so often, the splice begins to leak because the stock hose cracks a little. This is easily repaired by cutting off another 5mm and re-splicing, but obviously that's not sustainable. Here are some close-up views of the threads, and also the gauge for ID purposes. That's a AAA battery for scale. 

I would reccomend against this. It only takes 10 seconds to hop on a bike and make off. Although some suggestions come to mind 

Perhaps try for a used fork. For a decent new 29er fork you're looking at Â£250+ (I estimate thats around $300) (such as rockshox reba) - or go rigid. It's sureley better than a cheap fork. 

My free hub body has cracked and im looking to replace it. I have discovered it uses a 14mm hex key to remove. I cannot find a freehub body for sale that matches m785. Will a "m760-m765" body fit my "m785" hub? 

Bikepacking tends to be more lightweight and generally doesn't involve panniers or racks. Just look at the rigs used by tour divide riders ($URL$ If you think you need pannniers, then perhaps you are talking about touring rather than bikepacking. Bikepacking luggage will typically require one or more of the following: 

Manufacturers will use machines to build the wheels, however on top end bikes the manufacturer will build the wheels by hand (a skilled wheel builder's work is considered better than that of a machine). Your LBS will unlikeley have a machine to build wheels and this will be done by hand. So in summary. New bike - wheel was most likeley build by machine. Repairs - wheel was almsot certainley built by hand. As @arne said. You can search youtube for "cycle wheel building machine"
