To learn in an a posteriori manner means to learn by induction i.e.Â  (1) To learn from examples, such that each positive example strengthens one's confidence in the result. (2) That there always remains the possibility of a negative example, a counter-example, of dis-proving the result. Whether "red is rouge" is a posteriori depends in particular on (2). That is, is it conceivable that one will suddenly realize that red is not rouge? For Kant, who was the first to discuss these distinctions at length, it is not possible that red will turn out not to be rouge. But by other conceptions of meaning it may be possible. The example is controversial, and so is the very possibility of analytic a posteriori statements. 

The assumption "If it does not resemble the past, then all predictions about the future are equally reasonable" seems shaky. Consider the following alternative, which may be termed reverse induction. 

Contingent existence seems to have been a "matter of fact" for Hume. He supposed all "relations of ideas" to be knowable with certainty. Therefore contingent existence, to the extent that it is not known with certainty, must be a matter of fact. 

As if there were, on the one hand, people who are (merely) just and holy, and, on the other hand, people who are necessarily just and holy! These would be the perfect people, angels-like, unable to err... Socrates's actual intention seems to me, however, more mundane. I think that he uses the term "necessarily" merely to qualify an implicit, trivial implication. As if it was written 

Kantian intuitions, as I understand them, are basically just changing kaleidoscopic images. That is, heaps of sensible qualities, like colors, stretched over space and time. . To say that Kantian intuitions are "non conceptual" seems to me ambiguous. The Kantian intuitions do not involve "the concepts of the Understanding", especially the concepts of enduring substances and of causes and effects. But Kantian intuitions can and do involve other kinds of concepts: concepts of space and time, which Kant identified with mathematical concepts (arithmetical and geometrical); qualitative concepts: colors, sounds, smells etc; concepts of strength and intensity. Kantian intuitions are conscious, at least in potential. Nothing is hidden in them. As to being "objective", this is again ambiguous. Anything that can be thought about Kant calls an "object", including subjective phenomena and unknowable things. The word "objective" he usually reserves for the sensible (material) world, and for the possibility of knowing it. So intuitions can represent objects without being objective; as they do in dreams. It is instructive, in the present regard, to compare the Kantian intuitions, that is sense experience, to that of the classical empiricists (Locke, Berkeley, Hume). The empiricists conceived of sense experience as consisting of bundles of sensible qualities, such as colors and shapes. All our concepts were, according to the empiricists, subsequently derived from the encounters with these bundles. Kant added over these encounters with bundles of qualities that (1) time and space are not derived from sense experience, but are its apriori forms; and that (2) the concepts of the Understanding, concepts of enduring substances, and of causes and effects, also have an apriori basis, and so are not derived from sense experience. There could be an experience of objects which does not abide by the concepts and rules of the Understanding (in this sense, the Understanding is not like space and time). But there could not be an objective experience, i.e. an experience that can lead to knowledge of an objective world, which does not abide by the concepts and rules of the Understanding. And this makes those concepts apriori valid. 

If we start, as utilitarians do, from the idea that everyone is of equal moral importance, we do need a method of aggregating individual utilities that treats each person's utility outcome for a given action as having equal importance. The simplest mathematical function that achieves this is taking the arithmetical mean. While other procedures are available (for instance, taking the mean of the cubes of utility), the arithmetical mean as simplest has a default presumption in its favour. 

Metaphysics Epistemology Value Theory (includes moral and political philosophy and the philosophy of art) Philosophy of Language Philosophy of Mind Logic Philosophy of the special sciences (philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of physics, philosophy of history, etc.) 

This list has a good deal of overlap, too. Metaethics arguably straddles all of the first 3; philosophy of mind overlaps with at least metaphysics, etc. Philosophy of language seems an odd man out, but given its importance in analytic philosophy and that it cannot be comfortably subsumed under any other branch on my list, I'm stuck with the oddity. 

I am going to answer entirely on the logic side, disregarding the connection to religious issues. There are a wide range of logics available. Call Classical First-Order Logic (CFOL) the logic that is usually taught in contemporary introductions to formal logic. It has several properties of relevance here. For example: from P & ~P, everything follows, P v ~P is a logical truth, and quantification (statements like 'There is an x such that Fx' and 'For all x ....) range only over objects (hence 'FO'). There are various extensions of CFOL. Higher order logics allow one to quantify over properties of objects (Second Order Logic), or properties of properties (Third Order Logic), etc. SOL is needed to state the full generality of the principle of mathematical induction in arithmetic, to articulate a formal theory of arithmetic such that the natural numbers are (up to isomorphism) the unique model of the theory, and to state in full generality Leibniz's laws of identity. For each order above first, there are alternative semantics available which induce different rules of inference. There are various modal logics, which add operators for notions like metaphysical possibility and necessity, temporal relations, epistemic notions, and notions of permissibility and obligatoriness. Even for metaphysical necessity (likely the best studied modal logic), there are multiple logics available, depending on the underlying view about the relationships between possibility and necessity.) There are also many restrictions of CFOL. Intuitionistic logic gives up on the general truth of P v ~P, doesn't in general allow you to conclude P from Q & ~Q (though ~P still follows), and treats quantification somewhat differently. Relevant logics require more for the truth of P --> Q than the CL condition that either P is false or Q is true in order to avoid the paradoxes of material implication. (Along the way, it looses the principle of Disjunctive Argument: From P v Q and ~P, Q.) Paraconsistent logics drop the principle that everything follows from a contradiction (in a fashion rather different than does Intuitionistic logic); it is motivated in part by the idea that there may be true contradictions. There are multi-valued logics which assign, in their semantics, more than 2 truth-values (even for 3 values, there is more than one way to proceed) and adopt corresponding principles of proof. These are not in general classifiable as restrictions or extensions of CFOL; it depends upon the details of the particular multi-valued logic. That is just a very quick (hand-wavy, really) survey of some of the better know alternatives to CFOL. It is, however, sufficient to establish that not only are alternative logics possible, they are actual. However, none of these (including CFOL) are universally accepted as logic; the demarcation of the bounds of what really counts as logic is one of the central problems in the philosophy of logic. 

There is a familiar way to "salvage" intentionality of non-existing objects, as a real (metaphysical) relation. But first, let's briefly describe the core problem. Metaphysics is supposed to describe reality as it is. And reality is supposed to consist of existing things, and just of them. Real properties are supposed then to exemplify existing things. Real relations are supposed to relate existing things. It therefore seems nonsensical to speak of a having a real relation with a non-existing thing. A thing that does not exist, if this even makes sense, is ipso facto not a part of reality, and so is not a part of the "web of existence" that metaphysics is due to describe. If a real relation must have existing terms, why don't we make the desired term exist? And indeed, the familiar move is to hold that even non-existing objects exist ... in some mode. This requires, then, to distinguish several modes of existence. During the middle ages was developed the idea of a kind of intra-mental existence, alongside real extra-mental existence. This idea still figures in Descartes's proofs in the Meditations, where he distinguishes "objective" (mental) existence from "formal" (extra-mental) existence. A more recent variation, which was motivated by Brentano's theory of intentionality, was Meinung's theory of objects. His idea was to posit an ontological category of "objects", which is antecedent to existence, and which expresess the mere potential to be "intended" by a mind. So unlike the medieval idea of intra-mental objects, we now have a category of objects which are extra-mental (not internal to the mind, but intended by it) but might not (really) exist. If we also believe that being an object, in the renewed extra-mental sense of the word, is a sufficient condition for being a term of a real relation, we can allow relations with non-existing terms. Meinung's approach is often believed to have been dealt a severe blow by Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions. The latter provided an alternative framework to explain how we seem to be able to intend non-existing objects. 

Yes, the original atomic theory, usually attributed to Leucippus and Democritus, was formed in part as a response to Parmenides' arguments against the reality of movement, and to the related paradoxes of Zeno's. The Democratic atom possesses some of the properties of the Parmenidian One: It is neither created, nor destroyed. It also never changes, intrinsically, but only in relations to other atoms. One could say that while Parmenides rejected the reality of relations altogether, Democritus made them the basis of contingency and movement, keeping intrinsic properties fixed.

An argument is deductively valid if and only if it's impossible for all its premises to be true and its conclusion to be false at the same time. If it's impossible for its premises to be true at the same time, then that is itself sufficient to meet that definition, and make the argument valid, independent of the truth-value of the conclusion. Whether this state of affairs should count as a feature or a bug of the standard predicate calculus depends on one's other interests in logic. It depends on what deductive logic is for or what it's supposed to capture. It depends on whether you think there is a single true account of logical consequence or whether different accounts of logical consequenceâincluding, for instance, accounts which would prohibit everything being derivable from a contradictionâmight be appropriate in different circumstances. (See the final section of this SEP article on logical consequence for discussion.) One way to think of it as a feature is to think of the predicate calculus as having hard-coded a prejudice against contradictions. Once you accept as true two sentences which deny one another, you're in la-la land, it implicitly suggests. You might think of the system itself as expressing in its assumptions: âif that can be true, anything goes, and all bets are off. Truth preservation no longer works.â And there's a good rationale for this prejudice. Socrates' arguments set up a tradition in western philosophy of seeing refutation by exposing a contradiction as a gold standard for argumentation against any position. That anything follows from a contradiction is simply a reflection of the absolute inadmissibility of contradictions into a reasonable set of beliefs. But of there are other views about contradictions, and whether they are ever reasonable to accept. See the SEP articles on contradiction and dialetheism for more. 

One problem with answering this is that prominent philosophers, past and present, have offered inconsistent answers. Rudolf Carnap's definition for instance, described in an answer here by Hunan Rostoyman, is of historical interest, and may be attractive, but fails to reflect a lot of work that's widely agreed to be squarely philosophy. A way of describing the limits of Philosophy that I think better captures its current and past boundaries is that philosophical questions are questions of general interest which cannot be resolved empirically. I mean, they cannot be resolved scientifically or by observation. A reason to limit Philosophy this way is that Philosophy has historically worked on a large number of questions which eventually shifted into the realm of Natural Philosophy, or later, "science," as our ability to answer them empirically improved. The nature of time, the nature and reality of matter, the nature of atoms, the origins of human beings, and similar questions were philosophical questions for a long time, in that philosophers could offer arguments for and against the coherence of some understandings of them, but could not answer them scientifically. As science improved, those questions in large part moved out of philosophy, and only some philosophical aspects of them remained. Philosophers of physics still work on questions about time that go beyond what science says, for instance. Some questions, like what is the best life for a human being, or whether it's ever wrong to lie, will (I suggest) never be answered empirically, to any degree. One fairly minor, but growing, exception to this in contemporary philosophy is Experimental Philosophy, or X-Phi. But I would suggest understanding that movement as social science applied to informing our understanding of (as opposed to philosophically answering) certain philosophical questions that are amenable to it. 

The heuristic that the burden of proof is on the affirmative side of a dispute is intended to be broader than just claims of existence and non-existence. It is also one of a number of different (sometimes conflicting) considerations that go into the determination of the burden of proof. I said 'heuristic' as there is no algorithmic way to determine where the burden of proof lies. Imagine that we observed some phenomenon for which cannot account, say the diminished bee populations. Were I to suggest that the population decline was caused by cell phone transmissions, you might well accept that this is the sort of thing which could conceivably be involved but might still reasonably demand to know why I think this. 'Well, why do you think it isn't cell phone transmissions?' would be a wholly inappropriate reply on my part. As I am offering the positive account, all else being equal, the burden is on me to establish that my account is correct, not upon you to impeach it. Another consideration is initial plausibility. Say that we were to arrive at my apartment and observe that the door frame was splintered, the door was open, all my electronics and other portable valuables were gone. You offer the theory that I have been robbed; I offer the theory that a highly localized meteorological phenomenon tore through my apartment. We both are offering affirmative claims, but since yours is quite plausible and mine is not at all plausible, the burden is on me rather than on you. Indeed, we would reasonably take the inability of proponents to mount a serious case for alternative explanations to count as a reason to accept your account. Neither of these are fool-proof. One can often reformulate a claim to change whether it seems affirmative or negative (often with a transformation that seems less like a cheap trick than the one your offer). And, erroneous beliefs will adversely affect the extent to which our judgments of plausibility are reliable. (It takes a fair bit of knowledge of 20th c. science to find it plausible that the chair on which I sit is made mainly of empty space.) Some conflict between these two considerations can help explain why "all else being equal" is needed. If you have the view that dogs exist and I've the view that they do not, the fact that your claim is affirmative hardly means that the burden of proof is on you; my claim is so implausible that that implausibility swamps the affirmative nature of your claim for purposes of finding where the burden of proof lies. A third consideration is the costs of error on each side. Consider two drugs developed by pharmaceutical firms, one intended to help with acne, the other to help patients with advance terminal cancer. The burden of proof to establish safety of the drugs is higher on the firm that developed the acne medication than it is on the firm with the drug targeting the cancer patient as the cost of error in the acne case is much higher.
