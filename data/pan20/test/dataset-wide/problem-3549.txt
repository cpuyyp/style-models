First, as others have said, 1 month is too soon to start seeing any drastic results. I would suspect that your apparent "weight gain" is just water retention and early adaptation to a different exercise load than you are used to with cardio. Also, I would encourage you to keep a highly detailed food log for 3 days to a week. And by detailed, I mean where your "a salad and some salmon" is "5 oz lettuce, 2 oz broccoli, 2 oz corn, 5 oz grilled salmon with 2 tbps low fat vinaigrette", and your bagel becomes "1 5 oz cinnamon raisin Brugger's bagel with 3 oz almond nut butter and a 6 oz banana". Next to EACH food item, write down the exact calories. It is very easy to under/over estimate calories, and that can easily derail a fitness program. 

There is going to be a lot of conflicting view, simply because we don't understand a lot of the science behind it. Your best bet is to look at long term solutions, read everything you can from both sides of the fence, and come up with a sustainable solution that works for you. In general, yes, if you take in less calories than you expend, you will eventually lose weight. It takes about 500 calories a day deficit to lose a pound a week. Personally, I don't like the term "diet plan", as it generally has the connotation of being a short term thing. "Oh, I dieted and lost 50 lbs, now I don't have to diet anymore", which is why so many people fail to keep the weight off and even gain more back. I prefer something like "eating habits", or similar. I personally try to follow the Atkins guidelines. I know for a long time they were put down, but there are a LOT of eminent physicians, cardiologists, etc. that are starting to get behind it. You need to read the plan to understand it though, too many people think "Oh, it's just eating steak every night", and it's not. Boris is right: read the science, not the hype. 

Link to specific page So the claim that he is putting forth is that by training at our near your threshold for an extended period of time you "lower the bar", so to speak, of lactate tolerance. So if you lower the lactate tolerance, or the point where aerobic and anaerobic start meeting, it would negatively impact performance. Note, this won't really affect anything under 400m, and will have not much effect at the 400. It also won't really affect anything greater than the mile, except possibly in sprint finishes. The major impact for this is going go be in the 4-800 meter up through the mile (ish). (If you believe the theory, I haven't researched it enough to see if there are corroborating studies for the above claim). 

Seat height - Having a seat that is way too high or low can place odd stresses on the knees, and if it is too high, can also cause hip issues because you have to "rock" back and forth on the seat to stay on the pedals. A good bike fit can take that away. Cleats - Forward/back may not cause pain but if the cleats have your feet pointed in/out more than normal it can cause knee pain, especially if you have feet that are more than mildly pigeon toed or splayed outward. Crank length - This is somewhat controversial as to how much influence crank length has on the stroke, but if you are trying to push big gears with a wildly long crank length, then you can place some really odd stresses on your knees. Cleat height - If your legs are different lengths (Most are to some degree) then you may need shims under your cleat to make the platform height higher. 

If you've already tried bodyglide and similar remedies, I think those two may be your best options left. 

BMR is basically an average over the day, and there isn't a whole lot of difference between waking and laying on a couch than sleeping. You're basically still just sitting there moving air in and out. Any differences between the two are minimal. The average sleep figure for calories burned is around 80 per hour, which may vary from individual to individual. It also isn't really necessary to track intake/expenditure by hour or specific time frame, since it's a long term process. Make sure that you track what you eat for a day until you have a handle on your caloric intake, and let the scale over time set your trends. If you aren't losing weight, you either need to exercise a bit more or eat a bit less. Over time, it really is that simple. 

It's fine to lean over. Depending on other factors, you may lose a few watts of power if you are at an extreme lean, but since you aren't racing or anything like that, it's pretty much a non factor. What is going to be important is your seat height, and to some extent the position of the knees over the pedals. When you have the pedal at the very bottom of the pedal stroke, with your foot flat you should have some bend in the knee. Too straight then you have to rock your hips or carry your heels really high, and if it's too low you place stress on the knees. Same with the forward back of the seat, when you are at the bottom of the stroke again, your knee should not be more forward than your toes, or behind the spindle in the pedal. Too much one way or the other also places stress on the knees. And tell your friends to take a look at any bike race, and see how many of them are sitting as upright as possible (When not eating or taking a leak). 

Sure it's possible, but it depends on what you are personally willing to sacrifice. There are 168 hours in a week. Even if you work 60 hours in a week and sleep 56, that leaves 52 hours of the week available. If you are single without kids, it is plenty of time to get in the workouts needed to shape your physique the way you want. However, it will require intense attention to the details and time management. You have to figure when you will sleep/recover, when you have time available for working out, strict diet attention and planning, things like that. As a programmer, you have an advantage, since you are used to working within program specification requirements and language constrictions (I'm a programmer as well.) Things you can do include preparing healthy meals/snacks for the week on the weekend or whatever your days off are. Grill 5-6 chicken breasts, a few steaks and you've got lunches for a week. Throw a chicken breast on top of spinach with some mushrooms and dried fruit, a little vinaigrette and you've got a power lunch. Avoid the temptation to munch while at your desk unless it's a planned snack/meal. If possible, you can get some workouts in on your lunch hour if you have a convenient gym, work split shifts, see if you can work some hours from home. As an example, I am at my desk from 6am until 4pm 5 days a week. I regularly put in 15-20 hours a week of triathlon training, including 1/2 hour swims or runs at lunch, and working out immediately when I get home, with long workouts on the weekends. I am down 42 lbs from the heaviest I ever got (208 lbs at 5'10") when I first started working as a programmer. It's absolutely doable, but it all depends on your own motivation and how religious you want to be about pursuing what you want. 

What you're addressing is also known as cortical remodeling. The human body is constantly recycling bone, at the rate of about 10% replacement per year. Impact and load bearing sports (Soccer, martial arts, weightlifting, running, etc.) are known to help retain bone mass density (BMD), while non weight bearing sports (swimming, cycling) do not have the same benefits. This BMD benefit was shown to persist through adult/aging cycles, even if the person no longer participated in athletics past youth levels. Much of the benefits from cortical remodeling due to sports comes from the stresses placed on the bone from the muscles (through the tendons) that are attached to them. I am not aware of (and was unable to find any through pubmed) any published articles that directly relate impact to bone growth in the area, although there have been some measurements that show elbow regions with greater bone density due to repeated elbow strikes, but whether this is due to the impact or the stress on the tendons/muscles was not shown. The whacking of the leg, thrusting hands into sand, hitting the boards (makiwara) are not necessarily designed to increase the bone density, but to increase the muscular strength to direct impact and to deaden the sensation of pain in the area. Especially for younger athletes, this is not recommended. Direct impact in a small area (such as hitting the shin into a tree) can kill the periosteum, which will result in no more bone growth in the area. If you feel the shin of an athlete who played soccer for example, you will often find "pits" in the edge of the bone where growth was impacted. For the vast, vast majority of people that train in martial arts, there is no real need to start mangling your shins or beating up innocent trees. When we did not have protective padding, it was necessary to deaden yourself to impact to be able to fight effectively, however this is not really the case any more unless you are intending to fight competitively in the Muay Thai/kickboxing/MMA type arenas. 

If they are fun, they are more effective because you are more likely to do them. As far as them being more effective in actual muscle building, it all depends on form. If form is correct, then they are not any more or less effective than any other ab isolation exercise done with correct form (With the caveat that cable crunches are often easier to do with higher level weights). The primary function of the rectus abdominus is flexion of the lower (lumbar) spine. Depending on whether you anchor the pelvis or the chest, it will move one or the other towards the opposite. (Anchor pelvis, it will move the ribcage to meet the pelvis in direction, and vice versa). Anything that increases resistance to that movement will have beneficial effects. 

It's a little hard to tell, but since you have ruled out the scalene, trapezius and levator scapulae, my first suspects would be the sternocleidomastoid, or possibly (if it is towards the front of the neck), the platysmus muscle. This website, innerbody.com has a face muscle interface that is pretty nice, you can either hover over the muscle or the name, and it will highlight it for you, along with a description of the muscle and function. 

What you need to know is how much energy in calories you are expending every day. This equation is: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) + daily living activities + exercise activity = total caloric need. BMR is a calculated guess, unless you are lucky enough that you can have it directly measured using some form of calorimetry. Some of the calculation equations are the Harris-Benedict, Harris-Benedict revised, Catch-McCardle and Cunningham. You don't need to know these formulas, there are tons of them premade into calculators on the internet (The two Harris-Benedict formulae are the most prevalent). BMR is basically an estimation of how many calories it takes you to simply lay there and breathe in and out for 24 hours. Daily living includes normal activity such as work, shopping, house cleaning, etc. Exercise is, well, exercise. There are tables all over that have estimates for those activities as well. Now for the weight loss. This is going to be variable. As is pointed out in the comments, the 3500 calories per pound is bad mathematics misapplied, and started with an observation in 1959 by a Dr. Max Wishnofsky. Calculate your caloric needs, add in your activity cost, and eat less than that each day and you will lose weight. The rate at which you do will vary with your own metabolism, activity, types of food, etc. I would start by calculating what your needs are, then keep a food log for 3-5 days, writing down EVERYTHING that you eat. Weigh your portions, and get the best count you can for calories. That should give you a starting point for your weight loss. 

Other exercises that you can include are balance walking, single leg drills/exercises, various stretching routines to increase range of motion (Static stretching should only be done after finishing your workout), and other agility/motion drills that you desire or that fit with your chosen sport(s). For many other ideas on this, simply search the internet for "Health Trail", "Fitness Trail", and similar. A setup like this could very easily be done on a track, trails, or other running paths. With the exception of the few exercises that are marked with *, no equipment is needed, and if you have a fitness trail near you, then it is already set up. Alternatively, you could even set up some stations in your garage, and set out some 1/4 mile loops in your neighborhood so that you come back to your garage to do the exercises. This will hit quite a few areas. The straight muscle building with lunges, etc., mobility and agility with the high knees and other moving drills, range of motion, flexibility, and jogging/running the course will hit the cardiovascular as well. Depending on how hard you hit some of the movement drills, that also incorporates the HIIT style of training.
