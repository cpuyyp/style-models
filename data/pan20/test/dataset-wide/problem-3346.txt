Within an extensional semantic framework, the range of the function should in fact be the set of truth values, i.e. {1, 0}, in a standard bivalent logical framework. The domain is the set of individuals. A predicate, such as is red is analysed as a function from individuals to truth values -- namely, that function which maps an individual to 1 if that individual is red, and to 0 otherwise. The denotation of is red, as a function from individuals to truth values, can be written in the lambda calculus as follows (following Heim & Kratzer, 1998): [[is red]] = λx. x is red This is to be read as: 'the function from an individual x to true, iff x is red. I'm not really sure how to answer the question of how this is different to predicate logic. Using function-talk allows us to derive the truth-conditions of sentences of natural language compositionally, by using a general rule of composition such as function application (see again Heim & Kratzer, 1998). Predicate logic is useful for giving the truth conditions of an NL sentence, but it's not much use for giving an account of how these truth conditions are computed compositionally. 

Standard Basque has a sort of ordering system for the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: astelehena (week+first), asteartea (week+middle), asteazkena (week+last). The etymology of the standard names for the other weekdays is not transparent. One of several plausible etymologies for osteguna (Thursday) is bost + eguna = five+day. This implies a different numbering system (beginning with Sunday) than what is used for M-W. 

The English word child once had plural childer (regularized from the original invariant plural child). Another pluralizer -en was then added, giving modern children In Proto-Germanic, there is a class of verbs called preterite presents. These were perfective in Proto Indo-European, but reanalyzed as presents in Germanic. The past tense was then formed by addition of a suffix (cognate with Mod. Engl. -ed). So, the past tense forms of verbs carried two "past" markers -- the original PIE ablaut and the Germanic suffix. 

*This is of course soemething of a simplification of the literature on non-configurationality. **Full disclosure: a professor of mine. 

My understanding of the issues is as follows. Principles and Parameters is an almost-tautologous restatement of Chomskian UG: there are certain things that are not subject to cross-linguistic variation (principles) and other things that can vary but only in constrained ways (parameters). (The part about parameters is where the "almost" in "almost-tautological" comes in.) There are other things that can vary freely, of course – e.g. vocabulary. All of Chomsky's syntactic theories fall under the P&P approach. In Government & Binding (the immediately previous generation), things like Conditions A, B, and C were principles; parameters were things like the EPP ("Extended Projection Principle;" originally this was the "subject movement to Spec,IP" parameter). Minimalism's principles are things like Merge (the operation) and the conditions on it (Last Resort, no lookahead, ...). One of the themes of Minimalist thought has been moving the locus of cross-linguistic variation to the lexicon. So the old EPP parameter, which in GB was true or false of a language, now can be specified independently for each functional head. In response to the observation/criticism that a small set of global parameters is not empirically adequate to describe the syntax of all natural languages, there has been research into lexical "micro-parameters" to fully describe languages (dialects) with small syntactic differences. 

The Wiktionary page on the English word "with" < *wi says that the meaning of "with" shifted in Middle English to denote association instead of opposition. The latter sense is still present in phrases like "He picked a fight with the older boy" (opposition), whereas we see the former sense everywhere, e.g. "I walked to school with my friends today." Do we have any more information on how or why this shift may have happened? Are there other descendants of *wi that reflect this shift as well, or only the preposition "with"? The alternative to "with" may well have been "mid" (< *me, cognate with German mit), still seen in words like "midwife". Any idea why this fell out of use? 

In spoken English, is there a clear preference for using contractions? Does it depend on the locale? I am mostly interested in Midwestern and Northeastern USA, but I would also care to know how it is in England and Great Britain. Even if there is a preference, does it sound awkward or stilted when people avoid using them? Or, on the contrary, does it signal a higher register? I'm talking about contractions like you're, they're, haven't, we'll, etc. 

In non-finite contexts (which lack subject raising to Spec,IP) the verb moves past the VP-internal subject (ex. 17a): 

I'm not quite sure what you mean by a "direct n-language creole." Creoles can and do draw their lexicon from many different sources; I would argue looking at aspects of syntax often doesn't let us identify any clear parents at all. (Berbice Dutch, a SVO language, developed from Ijo and Dutch, both SOV). So it seems that creoles from exactly two parents are not the norm, and furthermore considering different aspects of a creole's grammar/lexicon can give different answers as to what language(s) are the parents. Nonetheless, here's an attempt at answering your question from a couple points of view. Whinnom proposed a principle of "tertiary hybridization" which states that three language groups must be in contact for a creole to form. This is perhaps best illustrated by an example: in Papua New Guinea, Motu speakers were responsible for much coastal trade; they spoke pidgin Motu with their trading partners. The Hiri Motu ("Hiri" means trade) language arose when various of the trading partners began using their common pidgin Motu as a communication device among themselves. Motu could not form the basis of a creole (so the theory goes) when actual L1 speakers of Motu were in abundance, because they would perpetuate Motu grammatical norms as opposed to allowing a novel creole grammar to flourish. But I suspect that you are asking about creoles with a significant lexical contribution from many languages. Smith (1987, The genesis of the creole languages of Surinam, a Univ. of Amsterdam dissertation) speaks of a core of lexical material found in English-based Atlantic creoles which comes from various African languages. It was probably first amalgamated in a pidgin English spoken in African ports, then carried to the New World by slaves. There is also Saramaccan, which is among the most "mixed" creoles known, having drawn large portions of its core vocabulary from both English and Portugese. However, it also has other European and African influences. 

What grammatical feature is being used, when we say something like, "I drink a cup of coffee"? In this sentence we have one noun modifying another noun, "coffee" modifying "cup". Would "cup" or even "a cup of" be an example of a determiner? If not, how would you describe these X of Y sentences in grammatical terms, where X and Y are nouns. As a very last question, would the grammatical terms used be the same in both English in German, where in German you would say, "Ich trinke eine Tassee Kaffee"? 

If my suspicion is right, and each of these sentences contains a subordinate clause, then does it follow that a subordinating conjunction (that, who, whom, which) necessarily introduces a subordinate clause? (I am assuming that all relative clauses are also subordinate clauses, as indicated on this grammar website.) 

In this example, the phrase "a wise king" is placed in apposition with Solomon. In your example, there is simply a series of independent noun phrases, separated by commas. None of them describe the other in any way. 

I would like to clear up some longstanding confusion of mine on subordinate clauses, especially since it is a rather simple grammatical topic and it is about time that I learn it. Which of the following sentences have a subordinate clause? I suspect that they all do, but I just want to make sure. 

The contrast between (1) and (2) shows that adverbs related to the speaker's perception of the event (luckily) must precede adverbs related to the subject's state of mind (mistakenly). And subject-oriented adverbs precede adverbs describing the event itself (tenderly), as (3) and (4) show. He has many, many more categories of adverbs than just these, and by pairwise comparisons he puts them all into an ordered sequence. He then argues that each adverb is associated with a functional head, and that the heads are also so ordered. Mark Baker proposed the mirror principle in this paper (JSTOR link). It says that, of two affixes, the one which is syntactically closer to the stem must be morphologically colser to the stem as well. So in a structure like the following, wherein Z is the root and X and Y are suffixes, we predict Z-Y-X and not Z-X-Y. 

(The judgments given correspond to most but not all dialects of Spanish. Whether a non-human living being gets a personal is, as I understand, a particular locus of dialect and speaker variation.) This is of course orthogonal to gender, which is marked in the usual Romance way on nouns, adjectives, determiners and pronouns. 

In the exclamation That you be happy! what part of speech is the word that? Is it a conjunction via ellipsis, i.e. "(I wish) that you be happy!" If yes, then does this poke a hole in the idea that subordinating conjunctions necessarily introduce subordinate clauses? 

The phrase "ein wenig" is reminiscent of the English phrase "a little", but what is interesting about "ein wenig" is that it is not an adverb proper. It belongs to a different class called an adverbial. How would you classify the English phrase "a little"? Is it also an adverbial? And how would you classify the word "little" (in this usage) on its own? It does not seem to be an adverb here. 

The French verb trouver (to find/think) can trace its ancestry back to the Greek word τρόπος, which means a turn, manner, style, or figure of speech. Is there any logic to this seemingly disconnected progression? I can perhaps see some kind of figurative relationship between the two. Each person's thinking is unique to them in the way that a style or manner can be. Is it this figurative description that explains the semantic shift?
