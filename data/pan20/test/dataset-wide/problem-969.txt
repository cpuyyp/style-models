It's not that hard to make an estimate. CO2 traps about 2 watts per square meter. Direct sunlight at 1 Astronomical Unit is about 1,360 watts per square meter, but spread out over the earth, average night and day it's about 1/4th of that about 340 watts per square meter. (note, Casey's point is valid, it's probably better to use the number of watts that hits the Earth, so, my estimate is likely a bit low) There may be more detailed and specific ways to look at it, but this is probably pretty close. If you shade enough sun to reduce 2 watts out of 340, or 1/170th, that should balance out climate change, at least at current levels. From space, you can view the earth as a disk in terms of area needed for shade, so the 2D area of the earth is about 127 trillion square meters, and 1/170th of that, about 750 billion square meters, or 750,000 square KM, slightly larger than Texas and as you get closer to the sun, the area needed is reduced by the square of the relative distance. Still, that's no easy task, to put up a shade the size of Texas into space and it's no easy task to keep it there as it would in effect by a huge solar sale and likely enormously heavy. It's far easier to simply build mirrors on earth than try to build something in space and I've seen that discussed as a possible solution to climate change. of-course, they'd need to be kept clean to be effective, it would require maintenance, but it's probably doable.

Some basic math on this: About 100 bolts of lightning hit the Earth every second and they average about a billion joules of energy be bolt. That's 3.1 billion lightning strikes per year, coming to about 3.1 billion billion joules per year, or about 860 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electrical energy per year. That estimate is pretty rough as some estimates have as much as 5 billion joules per bolt of lightning, pushing it up over 4 trillion kwh/year. Total human electrical usage, per source is about 18.1% of 104 trillion kwh/year, 2012 numbers, 18.9 trillion kwh/year of electricity generated. So even if all the lightning energy was utilized (which would be unlikley for a few reasons), it would be somewhere in the 4%-20% range of our total electrical demand, which isn't bad, but I think that's the answer to your question. There's not enough energy in all the lightning on Earth to supply our electrical demand. Wikipedia has an article on the logistical difficulties. It's perhaps doable, to some extent, but at best, lightning could provide only a small percentage of our electrical needs, unlike solar panels which could provide, at least in total energy, well in excess of our electrical needs. Solar runs into problems like it's not always on, which is a limiting factor to it's usefulness, but in terms of total energy provided it's much easier and much more abundant than harnessing lightning. 

This is a bad assumption. Gas expands when it's warmer. If you have the warmer planet "G" and the colder planet "N", you can't assume the height of the atmosphere's are the same. The troposphere, while a very thin layer of the atmosphere by size, it holds most of the mass of the atmosphere (80% on Earth). The Troposphere's height is pretty close to directly proportional to temperature. See here. As to the height of the stratosphere and mesosphere of the 2 theoretical planets, That's a more tricky calculation. 

Changing air currents is very difficult and energy intensive. You'd need to alter an entire weather system - no easy feat. If you heated a very large region of cool air you might prevent the spiraling that causes tornadoes to form, but you'd need to warm at least few states worth of upper atmosphere. It would be an enormous undertaking. There's also the logistical problem of how would you go about doing it? Heating in principal can be done faster than cooling, presumably sending up a whole lot of hydrogen in a few hundred balloons and igniting it forming hot water-vapor, which as it condenses, would further heat the atmosphere. Cooling warm air is harder as there's no quick and easy method to cool an enormous volume of air, so I think heating the high cold air would be easier than cooling the low moist air, but it would still be an enormous effort and probably cost more in prevention than the tornadoes are likely to do in total damage. $URL$ There's no neat and tidy technological trick to get it done that I can think of. 

Just to add, cause I don't see it in the answers above. Continents are no heavier than oceans. As far as the Earth is concerned, they weigh about the same and they drift according to the flow of the mantle underneath. Like marshmallows in cocoa, sometimes they will drift and touch (and by touch, I mean, crash into each other and form Himalaya sized mountain ranges) and sometimes they will float apart. There's nothing strange about the continents all being together. 

It depends on the season and even more on latitude. At any given time, the same side of the Moon faces the Sun. Where you stand on Earth doesn't change which part of the Moon is lit, but if you think about the orientation of people on the earth, people in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere are "upside down" to each other and people on the equator are perpendicular. The Moon doesn't change but the point of view of people on Earth relative to the Earth's surface makes a full 360 degrees of rotation based on latitude, so the same moon at the same time can appear as a left crescent, a right cresent, a boat and a yamaka depending on the person's latitude at the time of viewing. Also explained here. And this should probably be astronomy. 

As we can see from the chart, there's been a pretty steady drop in CO2 PPM over the last 15 million years or so. As the ocean grows colder it can store more CO2 so there may be a correlation between falling temperature and falling CO2 PPM - one of the primary climate feedback mechanisms, but predicting future CO2 levels - I wouldn't even know what to guess. Certainly low enough CO2 PPM could lead to further ice ages, even after Antarctica drifts off the south pole, so, there's the problem - too many unknowns. This question has no answer. A 4th possible key driver would be ocean currents, as indicated by the theory that the formation of the Isthmus of Panama may have been a key driver in the current ice age cycle, but predicting ocean current changes millions of years into the future is above my pay grade. The 3 primary drivers do seem to fit past ice ages. The the Andean-Saharan ice age period 425-450 million years ago, CO2 levels were much higher but that long ago the sun was perhaps 3%-4% less luminous and much of the land was over the antarctic circle. 

I'm going to try to answer this, though it's actually a very hard question depending on how close you look at it. Lets start with the American Physical Society's statement on climate change - which, they've made an effort to balance out following their 2007 statement of "evidence is incontrovertible" that got some members upset and lead to a handful of high profile resignations. More on that here This is their more balanced statement. $URL$ 

Yes, and no. Because the gas comes from Uranium, (and mostly from underground), Uranium isn't exactly common but it's not super-rare either. 

Short answer: There's probably very little effect, but "entirely independent" is another matter entirely. There might be some small effect on a year to year, or, for sake of argument, 12 year orbital period of Jupiter. Long answer. The precise cause and predictability of (El Nino/La Nina and Neutral), or, lets call it ENSO remains inexact and it's at best, a complex combination of causes and feedbacks. I'm not precisely sure if it's simply complicate or there are still some unknowns that make any kind of longer term prediction very difficult. I suspect there's still some unknowns and uncertainty in the longer term causes of ENSO. This is a pay article, in the summary it says. 

First things first, I think the spirit of your question, when talking about identical planets with identical solar input but with different atmospheres, you want to ignore albedo. Albedo's a key component semi-black body or, planetary equilibrium temperature calculation. Reflected light doesn't warm the object under the sun, only absorbed light. In other words, if you have very similar planets, same gravity, same atmosphere, same distance from the same sun, but one is black and one is white, the black one would be warmer. I mention this because snow cover lowers the albedo of a planet and the snow cover is a primary feedback mechanism in the rise and fall of ice ages. Your question appears to focus primarily on the atmospheric effect, and I'm assuming you want to ignore snow-cover, which no climate model would do. 

This is incorrect. It's not the size or density of the atmosphere but it's opacity to the long-wavelength infrared light radiating from the Earth that drives climate change. (feedback mechanisms like melting ice and rising albedo play a role too), but changes in the Atmosphere's density or mass are largely irrelevant. Burning fossil fuels doesn't change the density or mass of the Atmosphere much anyway and they might even make the atmosphere a little lighter, though the overall calculation gets pretty complex with plant growth and oceanic absorption. When fossil fuels are burned, O2 is taken from the air, combined with hydrocarbons in the fuel which becomes CO2 and H20. The net mass change of O2 lost and CO2 gained depends on the Carbon to Hydrogen ratio of the fuel burned, but the effect is pretty small either way. High hydrogen fuels like Methane, the primary ingredient in natural gas, takes more O2 from the air by mass than it returns in CO2. More Carbon rich hydrocarbons like coal, the mass ratio is closer to even. But in either case, the 30 plus billion tons of CO2 that's produced every year is negligible compared to the 5.1 million billion tons of the atmosphere. That's less than 1 part in 100,000 by mass per year. What drives climate change is what happens to the long-wavelength infra-red light that leaves the Earth. The longer wavelength photons that leave the Earth sometimes hit a molecule of CO2 that temporarily wiggles, before reflecting that light-energy back. That's the basis of the Greenhouse effect. The reflection back to the Earth of long wavelength infrared light. and more CO2 means more IR light gets reflected, which adds heat to the atmosphere. In a nutshell it's the color of the sky, that is, color in wavelengths we can't see, so calling it color isn't quite right either, but that's the gist of the greenhouse effect. Opacity not Density, though if you were to make Earth's atmosphere a lot more massive, say 10%-20%, that could have an effect, but we don't have the means to do that. 

There's still a lot that isn't understood about the Earth's magnetic field, so there's some uncertainty to any answer to your question. That said, I touch on some of it.
