I'd think that oil would repel water (make washing harder) and attract dirt. Maybe since we're in such a wet climate (Andrew and I live near each other) it's decent advice to keep the rain/wet trails/dirt of your bike but I still think that your bike would gather dirt even in the West Coast rain. Especially in areas that are hard to get at like around the seat stays and seat tube. We oil our chains and they get filthy, even on the road. I'm not sure why it would be any different with the frame. I can't see any scenario where that is good advice. I agree with the comment that waxing would be a better option. 

Ask them. Probably strip off all the cables and get it as clean as possible. They'll prboably do the sandblasting but check they may want it to come bare already. 

Do you put anything under the clamp on the carbon to protect it? In the past I've tightened brakes on MTB handle bars to much and wrecked them so I'm wondering. 

I had the Garmin one (came with my Edge 500) and after about 6 months it died on me. After some reading it seems that the Garmin version is only water resistant. Living just outside of Vancouver BC I get a bunch of rain and ride in lots of wet. I even took it apart and the little screw that attaches the arm has no sealing so water just gets in. $URL$ I now have the Wahoo sensor and have about 600km on it. It works fine and was easy to set up. I can't really give you long term use feedback but at this point I'd get another one instead of the Garmin. 

They're fine. I live outside of Vancouver so I'm already riding in wet a few days a week some weeks. Just this morning I was coming down the backside of a climb at 70km and they were totally secure. Since the tires are so narrow they don't suffer from hydroplaning. The biggest thing to worry about is painted lines and manhole covers (or other metal covers on the road). Both are very slick when wet. I've always been careful but I know a number of other riders that have gone down cornering hard on both types of surfaces. You're right to leave yourself extra room to brake. Also don't forget to account for reduced visibility for both you and cars. 

For most people the advice goes that you keep your foot as flat as possible. There are some riders that ride toes down (even some famous ones in the Tour) but they've had a coach determine that in their specific case there is benefit to riding toes down. It's unlikely that you can keep your foot entirely level as it comes over the top of your pedal stroke but it should be level through the power stroke and around the bottom as you pull back on the pedal to spin. As a response to one of the other posters, be very careful about ankling. While it is touted as a great thing many coaches feel that it does nothing and is an old wives tale. Some even feel it's harmful to you. I've attached some links for futher reading on the subject. 

Agree with the answer above but one note on other ways. I've also been able to remove a chain with a standard chain breaker on BMX bikes, which essentially duplicate the setup you speak of. It's harder to put them back on than a bike with a rear derailleur (since you can get chain slack easy by compressing the bottom pulley) but entirely possible. Just takes a bit of practice. 

There is a bottom limiter screw on the front derailleur which may be of some help. Tension it up till it just goes far enough to shift. It's also possible that your rear derailleur isn't taking up the chain slack properly and is letting it bounce as you go over bumps. This would cause the bottom of the chain to slap as it goes forward to the front ring and could cause it to come off. In that case you might see about replacing the rear derailleur with one on which the tension springs are newer and reduce the slap. 

Many bike shops do a 'fit' session. Maybe more common for roadies but still useful for any rider. They'll measure you, watch you ride (video probably) and then come up with measurements that you'll be most comfortable on. Those measurements can be matched up against the bike. My LBS charges $75 but I've seen places charge up to $300. 

All you really need is some fabric to repair the whole (nylon) and a cheap blue tarp. You can sew the nylon/tarp combination to the outside of the bag then use seam sealer on bot the outside and inside to cover the seam and make the stitches waterproof. Even better if you can place the seam sealer between the fabrics and stitch through it then apply it to the outside. 

I assume you mean the quick release skewer and the answer is no, well at least not in my experience. I've spent a few years riding on the training skewer from my Tacx trainer and had no issues outside of the visual detraction of a silver skewer on black rims/wheels. 

I'm not aware of a 'specific' way but I'm fairly certain that if you got the bike frame vertically level then placing a level across your seat would show you if the seat is level. 

No you shouldn't be able to fully touch the ground from your seat. Maybe with your toes totally pointed you can get them both down but that's about it. As for getting on an off the bike, practice will make it easier. If you've never been riding a properly fit bike then I would anticipate it feels odd. You should be able to place both feet flat on the ground while standing over your top tube with a bit of room to spare so you don't accidentally hurt yourself by landing on the top tube. As for handlebars they should be at least 1 inch lower than your seat generally. The more flexible you are the lower you can go with comfort. Your seat should be level with the ground (not the top tube) or slightly pointed down. Your seat should be high enough that at the bottom of your pedal stroke your knee is slightly bent. If you're experiencing knee pain that doesn't go away after a few rides (to get used to the new setup) the general rule is to move your seat up if the pain is in the front of your knee and down if it's in the back of your knee. Stem length changes based on your torso length so I have to assume that the shop provided you with the proper length/rise of stem to suit your body. A proper bike fit is one of the best things to spend some money on with a bike. Just give it a bit of time as you get used to a bike setup properly. 

From the reading above, and other articles on the subject, I'm inclined to recommend against it. At the very least talk to a medical professional who can look at your pedaling technique and biomechanics and advise properly. 

I usually start by stripping a frame down. I'll leave the cables on if I'm not going that far but at least take the headset apart and take out the BB. Once I get it that far I'll finish off the frame then move on to the wheels. Pull out the bearings and check the balls, get new ones if needed and re-pack the hubs. I also clean the cassette at this point since it's mostly apart. I've never had pedals that required a rebuild but I guess I'd do it after I put the cranks back on. Then put it back together. 

Mountain Biking is the best thing. Was just reading a training article by Chris Carmicheal (trained Lance Armstrong) and in studies he did mountain bikers had the best natural spin. They figure it came from climbing on loose dirt while seated to make sure you had good traction. Another good exercise is to pedal with one foot. I do this once a week at the end of a ride. Only for a block or two but it really emphasizes the lack of pedaling in a circle. 

I've typically cleaned the area and just used clear nail polish to seal it again. You have to do it every month or so but if you're vigilant then it works. Kept my 10 year old MTB frame fairly rust free with this method. I'd also be interested in better methods that seal longer term. 

I'd recommend kryptonite. The Evolution Mini is used by a number of my friends (messengers) and they use it many times in a day. Keeps things secure and it's small. If you want a bit more flexibility in what you can attach to then go for a larger sized one. $URL$ 

The best 'repair' I saw that got our group home was when a guy snapped off his headtube. We grabbed some sticks and jammed them down the tubes and got to the car (1 hour away) so carry big sticks? 

I deal with this at least once a week. Yesterday I was going 18km and hour with a heart rate of 175bpm (normally that's 35+). I get on the drops on my bar to reduce my wind profile. I try to stay on less busy streets (normally I'm out in the farm area) because the side gusts will cause swerving. Pay very close attention to what's behind you b/c of swerving. Get in an easy gear and spin it out. Head winds are great 'hill like' training. Don't ever get a disc wheel since the added surface area will just make it worse in cross-winds. 

I'd vote for PinkBike or your local Craigslist. I know I look in both spots for parts when I want something new for my bike. 

You can probably change the stem to something shorter with more rise and not have anything else to change. This may be enough to relieve the back pressure and the drop bars will give you more hand positions which I've always found easier on my carpal tunnel. Changing the handle bars to flat bars will mean you have to get a set of shifters and brake levers to go with the new handle bar style. I'd also recommend that you get a set of full wrap fenders so you can keep the road spray to a minimum. I'm a designer and programmer so I understand the issues around sitting all day. A better investment may be in your chair at the office and your desk. You're spending way more time sitting there every day than you are on your bike. That is the place that you can most likely get the most benefit by setting it up for a proper ergonomic workspace. 

Runkeeper.com can have some routes but the only ones I find for my area is the ones I've added. $URL$ is another good resource. Those are the ones I use. 

Is it always in the same spot? Do you have a piece of gear that rubs in that spot? I know I have a jacket and if I'm not careful with the zipper I get wear spots really quick just above my crotch. It sounds kinda like what you're describing.
