The exact controls would greatly depend on exactly what kind of ship they are for I would think that in most scenarios, a supercomputer would be responsible for most of the detailed operations, with a human pilot giving basic instructions. For instance, a pilot might enter a command to go left, while the computer actually calculates the exact specifications of the maneuver and controls the engines, scanners, and everything else. Still, there would probably be buttons and switches for everything, in case of computer failure. The pilot would still need to be highly trained, just in case something goes wrong. And of course there would be a self destruct button, because you just can't have a spaceship without one. 

I could think of multiple ways that your sea creatures could attack land dwelling humanoids assuming they have the same level of technology. If they are capable of building functional vehicles as described then they obviously would have reasonably efficient ways to mine materials and create large constructs. One idea would of course be for them to build water filled weaponized mechs, but this would most likely be far to expensive to do for the entire military force, and only worthwhile if the mechs were extremely overpowered and capable of taking out large amounts of enemies at a time. Other vehicles, like planes or amphibious tanks, might have a better chance. A much more effective strategy might be to use ranged weapons capable of being launched underwater, perhaps even nuclear missiles is your species can create them. However if that were the case than the humanoids could likely use the same method against them. Either way the war would be over quite quickly. The sea creatures would obviously have a huge advantage underwater. If they waited for the humanoids to attack them, which would probably require the use of submersibles, the sea creatures would have a pretty good chance of winning. This might be the most effective strategy for them to win. Overall if the sea creatures are attacked by the humanoids then fighting them underwater would most likely be the best solution. On the other hand, if the sea creatures are attacking, ranged weapons would probably be the way to go. Either way, with the same tech as the humanoids they should have a decent chance. 

What would happen to an airplane in space? Or to be more specific, would anything interesting happen to the plane itself, and would the passengers and crew be able to survive for longer than a few seconds? Please note that I am perfectly aware that a plane cannot simply fly into space. I simply want to know what effects being in space-like conditions would have on the hull, systems, and people on board. I wouldn't expect there to be a major difference between a plane in orbit around a planet, and one away from any celestial bodies, but I am interested in both scenarios. While I have no particular airplane in mind, a commercial airliner would probably be the best example. 

Could a cow produce bottled milk? The answer is of course no; there is no way a cow could do that; obviously. Perhaps I should be more clear on what I'm asking. Is there any way a mammalian creature could evolve to create a substance within it's body that is somewhat similar to the one of the compounds we refer to as glass, give that material a defined shape, and somehow expel it from it's body? In the title, when I say "bottled" I am referring to the classic glass bottles that milkmen would deliver milk in, as seen below. Of course, the lids on these bottles are made from something other than glass, but just ignore that for now. So my question is: could a glass making creature exist; and how would it do what it does? (OK, two questions, so sue me.) P.S. If you're wondering why this question exists or how it came to be, don't; just don't. Edit: Any scenario that in some way resembles what I described above would be acceptable, the material does not absolutely have to be silicon based. 

In a galactic civilization with multiple races, what would be an ideal calendar system that everyone could use? FTL travel is possible (please no answers involving the implications of FTL, for the purposes of this question it is entirely possible without any side effects such as time dilation). Instant communication to anywhere in the galaxy is also possible. Would there be any way to create a calendar system that everyone could effectively use? A day on this calendar wouldn't have to be the same length as a day on earth, but it should still be close to a human sleep cycle (the other races would presumably have a sleep schedule similar to ours, but if there's any way a calendar could work with radically different schedules that would be great). 

Maybe Yes Man running on water has been the subject of several scientific papers. In particular Google for papers by J. W. Glasheen and T. A. McMahon. They studied the basilisk lizard, but their results can be extrapolated to humans. It's debatable how reliable such a large extrapolation is, but the result is that the required speed is so far beyond human ability that we can safely conclude it's impossible without some artificial aid. There's a summary of the results from the papers in this article and a more general summary here. The conclusions are that you have to run at a speed of 30m/sec, almost 3 times as fast as Usain Blot (10.4 m/sec). Which doesn't sound too bad, but you'd need to generate a mechanical power of 12kW to do it. Trained athletes can just about manage half a kW, and most of us would struggle to generate 200W. If you generate 12kW, you would probably be roasted from within. You can reduce this by having wider feet, webbed feet, stronger muscles, some way to dissipating heat, the most ideal way would be to reduce its height and weight. Even then it would hard for a being to keep it up for a more than a few seconds time. 

Naturally NO, Once a object is sufficiently large enough (300 km, 511 Davida), given enough time, the gravitational forces will optimize the shape to make it spherical. Most objects are slightly ellipsoid, to balance out its rotation. There are a few hypothetical objects like a neutron star spinning at a very high speed, causing it be ellipsoid, elongated, almost like an egg. Artificial/Man-made objects can be square, this would also include stars, planets, and satellites. For a species to achieve this it has to be above Kardashev scale 2.0. You can manipulate electromagnetism to create a thin layer of plasma around an object and force it to conform to that shape, or perhaps use swarms of nanobots made of carbon tubes to create a artificially box, similar to what @Durakken mentioned. But science of any of this artificial structures is beyond the scope of my imagination. 

Meditation, or Mindfulness, this can be achieved through genetic mutation, by increase few brain chemicals for alerts and decreasing or eliminating flight or fight responses. This could happen through lack of predators, easy accessible resources, but some reason to be in present. In our world when the practitioner attains certain level of mastery in meditation and mindfulness, their sleep acquires a character of meditation. It's not like they don't sleep at all, but they do retain certain level of deep awareness during their sleep. Specifically, when they see a dream, they know it's a dream. They remain aware of their body lying down on the bed. They remain aware of the content of their consciousness no matter how disjointed it gets during a deep sleep. If something happens around them, they wake up easily to provide their help if needed. Mediators also have been know to sleep less, more like 2hours a day. And here is a old BBC article about monks who sleep upright. Something similar but more genetic/biochemistry in nature, so it happens to all members the species. Culturally it would more like spirit walk than a dream because they can if necessary return to real world. Due to it being genetic it would more prominent, it would be really interesting society. 

I will assume that there exists a centralized semi-autocratic government which can enforce all these ideas, at the cost few civil liberties, and has sufficient basic resources. The best possible situation is when you see humans as resources to optimize and invest in. Cities and Buildings City designs and building designs would be completely different, most building would consist of both residential, retail, entertainment, school/university and work. Most people will work, reside and be capable of living in the same building drastically reducing travel time. All buildings would conserve space, resources and be utilitarian, rather than a status symbol. Even things inside the houses would be utilitarian all costly decorative things would be discouraged. Some devices or objects would communal for maximum efficiency and usage. Travel Cars/Vehicles would be fully automated, the reason it is hard to make a self driving car is that AI has to compensate for human errors. By enforcing mandatory automated vehicles, you can bypass the problem increasing efficiency and speed. Air Travel would be very limited, a rare luxury, same for Cruises, and any form of recreational vacations. Most transport vehicles/ships used for inter-city trade would be limited to essential raw materials. Any objects which adds to transport would a luxury, this includes but not limited to artisan products, crops/plants/animals which do not get cultivated locally, ornamental objects. Energy We currently have technology to make 100% safe nuclear reactors with no radiation leakage, which automatically shuts down to avert possible catastrophe, without the stigma associated most of energy will come from nuclear with some renewable. Centralized energy efficiency would lead to automated factories shutting down at evening to accommodate the increase in usage due to people returning homes. Energy intensive systems would work nights and afternoons. Unused public lights, house lights would automatically and if necessary remotely shut down. Refrigerators, ACs, heater would be forced to run at limited near optimal range of temperatures. Computer Computers will always be connected to decentralized system which will be used to spy, delegate excess computational capabilities, information from people will be used help them psychological and used to assign optimal jobs. Blockchain and other better technology will be used to optimize all possible resources. Centralized education to enforce ideas and culture of conservation. Others Standardized components, limited choice, mass producible objects, a system similar to decentralized communism. Having a hobby would become a luxury. Outdoor entertainment would be replaced by online games. Guns, weapons and military would be limited to bare essentials. Religion would be non existent, or be forced to spread the values of optimization and cooperativeness. Spying would allow easy detection crime and fraud. Even forcing only genetically better hand picked in-vitro babies. Democracy and free media would be banned/restricted as it starts propaganda warfare, all jobs/positions would be merit based. There would be a lot cultural changes forced upon people.
