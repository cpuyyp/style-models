My history book claims that the flow of Silver from the New World to Spain in the 16th century contributed to an inflation. However, that seems very unintuitive. How could gaining resources lead to a worse economy? The only explanation I could think of is that the sellers in markets knew that people had more money (silver) so they could charge higher prices. However, I still don't understand, because this would mean all exports are bad, because they bring in outside wealth. 

I am shocked that I cannot put my finger on this information and I must resort to asking here. I am looking for U.S. population estimates from 1790-present. Preferably there is an estimate for each year, but I am ok with just the census values every 10 years. I have tried navigating the U.S. Census Bureau's website for at least an hour with unsatisfactory results. I have also found this website, but I am looking for something which looks more citable. 

This is a partial answer and a collation mostly from Wikipedia articles. It would appear the the sloop Neva passed through Sitka in 1810 to deliver a salt cargo under the command of Ludwig von Hagemeister. The Neva was travelling from Hawaii. The Neva would later attempt to return to Sitka in 1812 but hit a rock and sank with the loss of 32 of the 75 onboard. It was carrying furs and guns from Okhotsk. It is possible that in between its passage in 1810 and its sinking in 1812 it came to Sitka again. Again in 1810 a ship visited Sitka to drop off Russians rescued from an ill fated expedition that was to explore the Oregon coast. The American merchantman Lydia arrived on June 9th. Also during 1810 there appears to have been a visit by another American ship which could have been the Lydia. The purpose of this visit being trade on behalf of John Jacob Astor. The ship then purportedly went to trade furs at Guangzhou. It would seem that visits from merchantmen was relatively common since Sitka was the capital of the Russian-American Company that exported furs. 

I am learning about nationalism in Europe in the latter half of the 19th century, and my history book uses the terms "urban working class", "middle class", and "land-owning peasants". What were some of the occupations of the middle class? Would buisiness owners be considered part of the middle class? I thought that the middle class was the urban working class. Some excerpts from where the book uses class: "Parliaments and political parties were not the answer [to economic problems of all the people], according to Louis Napoleon. French politicians represented special-interest groups, particularly middle-class ones." (this is from a list of reasons as to why Louis Napoleon was so popular) "Second, as Karl Marx stressed at the time, middle-class and pesant proprety owners feared the socialist challenge of urban workers...." The book I have is "A History of Western Society", 10th edition by Mckay, Hill, Buckler, Crowston, .... 

The statement that the Tanjore Brihadeeswarar Temple or Periya Kovil has more stones than the Giza pyramid is highly doubtful. Here is why: First let us set out some assumptions so as to help us calculate the size of both monuments, otherwise the only way to settle the question is to go and count every block which would be rather tedious. The assumptions I have made are as follows: 

The uniform in the picture would seem to be that of an officer of a rifle brigade from the United Kingdom and not of a hussar as posited in another answer. This can be attested by the pouch belt chain lion worn across the chest. This item was worn, as far as I know, only by the officers of the rifle regiments/brigades. Furthermore, the style of embroidery and dull tint of the braid seems to align with the green jacket of the rifle brigade. Source: $URL$ As to the rank of the man pictured, it is hard to say. His sleeves and collar are relatively plain and thus would suggest he is not a particularly high ranking officer. Also, his only medal seems to denote a short or uneventful career despite his advanced age. Perhaps, he was simply a reserve officer in the London Rifle Brigade or some other reserve unit which didn't see much action before the 20th century. 

There are two primary references that have been (and are still being) cited by early and contemporary (i.e., 18th-21st century) historians regarding King Alfred the Great paying off the Danish invaders of Wessex in 876 A.D. The two most cited references are from the 9th century: (1) Bishop Asser's "Life of King Aelfred" (Asserius de Rebus Gestis Aelfredib, written in Latin), and (2) the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ", originally written in Anglo-Saxon. There are three articles in the Englsh language Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) that reference these two primary sources: "Alfred the Great", "Anglo-Saxon Chronicles", and "Asser". The Wikipedia article states that the credibility of Bishop Asser's account has been in dispute by many historians over the years, including arguments that not only is the document not authentic, but also recently (1995) being declared an absolute forgery. Since Asser's original document was hand-written more than 1,500 years ago, and lost or destroyed ages ago, it exists now only in the various translated and transliterated copies that were made centuries ago, If these two 9th century references are to be believed as being authentic and reliable, then the answer to the question being asked is clearly that King Aelfred did not pay off the Danes as legions of historians, past and present, have written. That being said, recent historians have tried to settle the historically long running disputes over many issues regarding Bishop Asser's mainly chronological account of King Aelfred's life. Some historians have agreed to disregard all previous arguments and accept Asser's account as both indisputably authentic and creditable, but others have not. The authenticity and reliability of Asser's account is then, unsettled. However, Asser's account of King Aelfred's life makes no mention at all of King Aelfred ever having paid a bribe to any invaders of his kingdom to keep them away. An exchange of hostages, yes. But goods or money, no. According to the Wikipedia article "Asser" (and other above listed sources), when Asser was still a Christian monk he was hand-picked by King Aelfred (a baptised Catholic) to join his court, an invitation which Asser (evidently of Welsh decent) declined to do for various reasons. Eventually, however, Asser, an anointed Catholic priest, did join Aelfred's court, but agreed to do so for only six months every year. Asser's role in Aelfred's court became one of being Aelfred's tutor, confidant, and administrator to Aelfred of the Catholic church's sacred sacraments and rites, including the sacred sacraments of Confession and Absolution, and Holy Communion with the body and blood of Christ. Finally, in evaluating the inclusiveness of Asser's account of the life of King Aelfred, it should be noted that, as King Aelfred's Confessor as well as being his close and beloved companion, that Asser's "Life of King Aelfred" could, but certainly would not, contain anything that was revealed to him by the King while he was exercising the Catholic rite of being the King's Confessor. Consequently, Asser's account of his King's life would not include anything relating to the payment of a bribe to the Danish king Guthrum if that fact had been confessed to Asser by the King during the Catholic rite of Confession.

It is clear why Cavour wanted the alliance, but what benefits would France have from allying itself to a relatively weak (as far as I know) kingdom? 

What is the Holy Roman Empire? I have a little background knowledge and I read a little bit on Wikipedia, but I'm still not exactly sure what it is. I know that the states under the "Empire" were still more or less independent. I also know from Wikipedia that the Holy Roman Emperor was the protector of the Catholic Church, and that the Holy Roman Empires consisted of mainly Germanic states, but that's about all I know. Also, who could be named Holy Roman Emperor? Was it Germanic Kings only?
