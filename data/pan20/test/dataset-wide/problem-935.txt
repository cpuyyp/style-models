Magnetometry is used to find archaeological features such as stone walls or ancient hearth. But it usually cannot be used for archaeological prospection in areas where the bedrock is strongly magnetic. Let's assume basalt - it is quite common near the town I come from. With an average cesium vapour magnetometer, how thick must be the soil so that I could find remains of highly magnetic features like remains of a burnt wattle-and-daub house or an iron depot? And if operating near a fault between magnetic and non-magnetic rock, how far from the magnetic rock can I find weakly magnetic situations like disturbed soil? EDIT: I expect approximate answer. An answer I would expect could start: "Iron is more magnetic than basalt, so several kilograms of iron (or iron rust) could be found even less than a meter above the bedrock under condidtions X, several meters otherwise. Very small iron items and piles of burnt soil would usually need several tens of meters..." I just guess all the facts, I don't know, I'm just an archaeologist with no background i geophysics. The aim of this edit is to emphasize that I don't need exact numbers, but I need an idea which numbers might be exact and which are likely to be completely wrong. 

I have studied archaeology, not paleonthology nor geology, so most of my answer is either extrapolation of what applies on younger material or layman's five cents. Still I hope it will be useful somehow. You already mentioned the fossilization processes - this is bit distant from my field so I'm glad that you are not asking for details on them. In archaeological record, organic material can survive for centuries only under specific condition, often similar to those leading to fossilization. These conditions are one of the main factors contributing to the density of remains of ancient people and the animals and plants accompanying them, along with past human behavior. Inhumation helps to preserve the bones, or, with specific grave construction and acidic soil, hair and even soft tissues (Egtved girl is a famous example). Anyway, animals or even plants never practiced any ceremonial burials, so this behavioral aspect is marginal for ancient fossils. Just that organisms whose habitat was more prone to fossilization are preserved more often - but this is still part of deposition and fossilization stage. Excluding the fossilization processes (which are crucial), geological stability is the factor number one (or number two, after them). The more volcanic activity, earthquake and/or erosion, the higher chance the fossils will be destroyed. As an archeologist, I had to learn at least a little on erosion, because they can destroy the artifacts we would like to find, or at least move them so that we might be confused in evaluating the context; I believe this applies even more for the millions of years of the fossils' lifespan. If I'm right (I might be wrong; this is not my field), this is not as important as the conditions for fossilization, because the erosion and other processes that might destroy or degrade the fossils are spread more evenly than the good conditions for fossilization. 

The primary drivers are the milankovich cycle, which leads to the ice-age cycle and feedback mechanisms. Colder oceans absorb more CO2, warmer oceans release CO2. CO2 and global temperature have an effect on each other, each driving the other forward or backward depending on how much ice-cover the Earth has. This is a well understood feedback mechanism that in no way contradicts climate change theory, in fact, they go hand in hand. 

It's important to identify which ice. Polar bears are arctic, and they hunt in large part on sea ice. Arctic sea ice is decreasing and the most common point used for the disappearing arctic ice is the arctic sea ice minimum, meaning, the yearly low point, usually late September, so by that definition, we'd have an ice free arctic, you know, for a few days, but ice will form again as winter kicks in. That loss of arctic sea ice probably won't kill "all" the polar bears but it would likely kill a fair share of them, making their hunting more difficult. This has already started and will probably continue to get worse. Also, arctic sea ice has virtually nothing to do with flooding cities. Flooding of cities has to do with melting of glaciers on land - essentially water that isn't currently in the oceans but as it melts it adds to the oceans. Also, warming oceans expand, so warmer water increases flooding too. As far as the timing of the ice free arctic minimum, it's very hard to predict due to natural variability year to year, but 40 years doesn't seem far off - at least, looking at the trend, but there's also no guarantee the trend will be consistent. 

Source of table. Running the Math, the radius of the inner core, 1,220 km and outer core, 3,400 km. Volume = 4/3 πr³, increase the density of the inner core as it solidifies by 5%, you end up with a bit under 3,350 km, or a reduction in volume of about 7.5 billion cubic KM (just by solidifying, not doing temperature yet). If you remove that much volume from the entire Earth though, it works out to 15 KM. My guess is that under such high pressure, the temperature contraction would be less, but that's just a guess. I found a few articles on the subject, pay articles mostly but nothing that neatly estimated temperature to density at 1 million atmospheres or more. That's the crux of your question, but I couldn't find anything specifically on temperature expansion at those pressures. I did find (and this is fairly obvious looking at a density of the Earth chart), that pressure determines density far more than temperature, inside the Earth. We think of solids as mostly incompressible, but that's no longer true with millions of ATMs of pressure. Solids do measurably compress at those pressures. This article says that pressure, not temperature is the primary driver for the core's density. Jupiter, as a fun example, shrinks about 2 CM per year. But much of it's size is gas, not solid, which is much more responsive to temperature changes. There's other factors too. Earth's rotation increases it's volume "slightly". Radioactive decay both helps maintain the Earth's interior temperature and it also releases gas into the core, mantle and lithosphere as a byproduct of that radiation, primarily Helium and Argon. (but if I was to guess, I think that's probably a minor factor in overall density and size and I think, ignorable). Lead is less dense than Uranium, but Calcium is more dense than Potassium, so the decay works both ways for density in that sense. Another factor for overall size is the changes to the lithosphere. Carbon capture and the formation of Granite over time, as well as the formation of soil, all tends to make the earth's lithosphere more puffy. But, taking that into account, the earth's Crust is about 30-50 km thick, over land only (29% of the earth). If we figure the Earth's Crust is about 40% expanded, over the entire earth, that works out to about 4-6 KM crustal expansion due to the oxidation of basalt rock and the formation of continental crust, probably a fair bit less than the contraction over the same period of time. One rather simple way to measure changes in size of the Earth is to measure it's change in rotation, which slows over time due to the moon, but can also change as a result of structural changes such as Earthquakes, or melting ice and growing oceans. While this may seem to have nothing to do with your question, Earthquakes are, in a sense, settling of the Earth, and large Earthquakes like the 2011 Japan Earthquake did speed up the Earth's rotation due to the Earth becoming slightly more compact. I think it's likely that the Earth grows more compact over time, but as Gordon Stranger said, it's very slow, and the Sun will go red giant long before the Earth's core is cooled. How much? If we say 15 KM due to solidifying the inner core, maybe another 10-15 KM for solidifying of much of the mantle, add (Gordon Stranger's estimate) of 10 KM due to temperature, and maybe add 1-2 KM due to the Earth's rotation slowing . . . that's a hugely ballpark guess, but adds up to about 21-32, but a safer, rounder estimate, maybe 20-40 KM as a bad guess accounting for some settling, but that's if the Earth is allowed to cool on it's own over a long enough period of time, like, I don't know, 50-100 billion years. That works out to roughly 1/2 of 1%. Works out to about 1/2 of 1% of it's radius. Earth's gravity would increase by about 1% as a result, 1.5% near the equator. Hope that wasn't too much guessing. This might be a tough one to get a definitive answer on, but I'm pretty sure you're right that contraction is the overall direction. 

I would have expected to find something here but there isn't a guide to ceramics there that I can find. This article and it's references may give you some guidance though. Found a limited table in this that will probably help too. 

It looks, to me, like nothing so much as polished Mookaite, that is agatised coral, mostly found in Australia, the various lines through it are actually coral growth-rings fossilised by silica saturated ground water. 

Surprisingly enough most of the figures I could find were actually about thermal output but back working the figures, and assuming I read the formulas properly (not guaranteed I'm afraid) it looks like 5-7 litres per second is the ballpark average gas flow based on fifty years worth of data from several fumarole fields in the central North Island of New Zealand. I have no idea how representative that figure would be of fields elsewhere. 

It's reporting bias, and over longer time spans there's a preservation bias as well since a small eruption like Ruapehu 1995-96 will not show up in the fossil record at all after a few hundred years of erosion. These days we watch the world from far more angles with far greater scrutiny than at any stage in the past so we see eruptions that we would never have paid attention to in the past that's all. That's why there are pronounced dips in the graph during the World Wars, volcanoes didn't stop but people were elsewhere with other things on their minds. 

I can make arguments for half a dozen or more things but the most likely are Agate and Calcite, try a drop of dilute vinegar on the surface, if bubbles form then you have a Calcite, or at least a reactive Carbonate Mineral, if it doesn't react then the most likely answer is Agate or another amorphous Silicate. I say these are the most likely purely on the basis of the commonality of those minerals generally it could be something really odd but I don't enough about the specific mineralogy of South Wales to start on those possibilities. 

It's difficult but not impossible to model the Earth, Moon and Sun, but the scale is a bit tricky to get right if you try to build or draw it. If we call the Moon's diameter = 1 moon unit, then, Earth's diameter is about 4 moon units. Distance between Earth and Moon, about 110 units, Sun's diameter, about 400 units, and the big one, the Sun's distance to the earth, about 43,000 moon diameter units. So if the Moon is big enough to see, but still very small, say 1 mm, then the sun needs to be 40 cm in diameter (about 33% larger than a basketball) and 43 meters away. 

A quick google search will answer this question for you. Read some of those, and if you still have questions, come back and ask. This really, really, really has been answered, again and again and again and again. If you have trouble, I can post some explanations for you. 

As the assumption is flawed, then both no and yes. With an imperfect calendar, then this would happen and the rate would depend on the accuracy of the calendar as noted above (not precession). Because we use a very accurate calendar that allows for adding and removing a leap year as needed, no "drifting" of the solstices across the months will happen. There will be some yearly variation as the solstice is a precise point in Earth's orbit, so it happens not only on a day but at a precise time, it might be December 21 one year and December 22 the next year, but every year our calendar gets "messed up" by about 6 hours, and every 4 years, that 6 hour error is mostly corrected. Jupiter also accelerates or decelerates the Earth in it's orbit and Earth's orbital speed varies depending on how close to perihelion and aphelion, so there's some variation year to year, but there's no movement across the calendar over 11,000 years. 

There are two "normal" mechanisms for this effect: Clay bonding, the beach sand contains a small fraction of clay particles which bond to the grain surfaces and hold the sand together when dry, this is normally the mechanism where the beach is backed by mudstone cliffs or quite close to river mouths supplying fine sediment to the beach. Evaporite Cementation this is the more widespread and common process then what you are seeing is a small scale, and often abortive/short-lived formation of "Beachrock" this is the most likely explanation and the cause will probably be a rainwater/seawater interaction on the surface of the beach where it is still wet with seawater but no longer wave-washed as the tide recedes. 

Okay have a look at this article it may be some use, it's the Journal of GeoEngineering, Vol. 8, No. 1 April 2013 Pgs 27-32 so you may be able to get a hard copy if the link fails, it talks about clay core dams and seepage calculations thereof, including phreatic pathway estimation. If I remember correctly rock fill in earth dams is treated as earth for the purposes of working out seepage lines etc... as it is generally small enough (particle size), relative to the dam as a whole, to have little or no effect on total mean permeability. 

Given the preponderance of young volcanic rocks in your part of the world I'd be inclined to go with Ignimbrite as my first guess. The picture you have supplied looks almost identical to samples I have at home of welded ignimbrites from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The black inclusions are likely to be Pyroxene phenocryst in a groundmass of what was at one point white hot volcanic ash. 

Wow, I just finished watching this it seems we know, or can guess, quite a bit about the level of Carbon, particularly Methane that were released at the end of the Permian and what they did to the climate. What seems to be missing is any consensus about why the Permian extinction stopped just that once things settled down climate and atmosphere swung back to about where they'd been beforehand. Inference to best-guess? It was rain and rocks that did most of it, with the biosphere in such a mess and so much new surface rock in Siberia the main mechanism to remove Carbon from the atmosphere would be chemical weathering; the rain dissolves Methane and Carbon Dioxide forming complex acidic solutions that react with the fresh rock, this forms insoluble Carbonates which lock carbon in the ground. 

Might not be the answer you're looking for but the most obvious effect would be a sinking of land and a spreading out of the oceans. Granite, basalt, glaciers and oceans are in a sense, balanced like weights on a scale by their enormous mass and the gravity of Earth. By replacing a mile or so of basalt rock with water at the bottom of the oceans the weight would be unbalanced and the continents would sink, similar to how some land is currently rebounding from the last ice age. The net effect over time would be a few hundred meters of sea level rise if the oceans were to become that much deeper. But I suspect that's not what you were looking for in your question. You probably wanted to know about weather or oceanic temperature effects. That's a little harder. I can give a sort of answer. Larger oceans would mean more dissolved atmospheric gas. I had no luck finding good estimates as to how much atmosphere is dissolved in the deep oceans overall, I was able to do a very crude calculation using this website and estimates that there's about 50 times as much CO2 in the Oceans as there is in the atmosphere. Now, my estimate is hugely crude, but there may be an entire Earth's atmosphere, both Oxygen and Nitrogen trapped in the oceans. The deep oceans hold a fair bit of Oxygen and Nitrogen so by making the oceans bigger, the effect might be a thinner atmosphere. 10% thinner? 20%? 5% I couldn't guess the amount, but something somewhere in that range seems probable. Regarding deep ocean currents, it's difficult (perhaps impossible) to say how currents might change. In general, ocean currents, while not simple, seem to follow fairly simple patterns. My guess is that the amount of depth you've added isn't enough to change that, though if you were to make oceans significantly deeper, you might get a few layers of circulation, not the three, sometimes four layers we currently have. (see pictures).
