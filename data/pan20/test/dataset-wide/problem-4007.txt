While I dont know the answer to your specific question it seems related to a well known problem where you only insist that the number of simmands is non zero. Much is known about it and there are interesting open problems. When n is a prime you need (n-1)k+1 vectors (and this is sharp). This is "Olson's theorem" and it can be proved by Chevaley's theorems on non zero solutions for polynomial equations when the number of variables exceeds the degree. Maybe similar techniques (at least for the n=prime case) will work for your problem.) The reference for Olson is: J. E. Olson, A combinatorial problem on nite abelian groups I, J. Number Theory 1 (1969), 8-10. For the non prime power look at the paper by R. Meshulam: An uncertainty inequality and zero subsums. Discrete Math. 84 (1990), no. 2, 197--200. For a general relevant method: N. Alon, Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. Combin. Probab. Comput. 8 (1999), no. 1-2, 7--29. 

A very good source of Bonnesen type inequalties is the paper by Rovert Osserman entitled Bonnesen style isoprimetric inequalities, Americam Math Monthly 86(1979) 1-29. Here is another link for the same paper through this page. Osserman's 1978 Bulletin AMS paper on the ioperimetric inequality is also a good related source.

Regarding Pach's original question: Bing's house deals with the analogous question of collapsibility. It is an example of a contractible non-collapsible space. For that problem it is known that if you allow both collapses and anti-collapses, every contractable space can be reduced to a point. This follows from "Simple homotopy theory". I dont know if this result of simple homolopy theory extends to animals built from cubes but they might. The modified higher genus question seems easier since you allow steps that changes the topology of the animal. One can ask a stronger question if when you fixed the genus g you can pass between two animals of genus g by such steps. The analogous question for collapsibility seems to relate to simple homotopy invariants of surface groups but I dont know what they are. 

Beurling considered a sequence of reals $1<x_1<x_2<\cdots <$ as "primes" and then the ordered sequence of all products of these "primes" as "integers". Let us consider Beurling primes which are small perturbations of the ordinary primes. My question is: 1) How small perturbation guarantees that the Beurling primes/integers satisfy the prime number theorem. 2) How small perturbation guarantees that the system of Beurling primes/integers satisfies the RH given the "ordinary" RH. 3) How small perturbation guarantees that the the system of Beurling primes/integers satisfies Cramér's conjecture ("the number of integers between the $n$th prime ($p_n$) and the $n+1$ prime is $O(\log^2 p_n)$) given the "ordonary Cramér's conjecture". Remark: I left the notion "small perturbation" vague and there is some other vagueness in the questions. But I will be interested in answers for any variant. Other basic results/conjectures can also be considered, and I will be interested also in information about them. Motivation: This is motivated by some questions raised during the discussion of polymath 4 that I recalled in the context of the recent question The enigmatic complexity of number theory . Clarification: (In response to Lucia.) I am looking for results of the following kind. (1) If $x_n=p_n+f(n)$ then the Beurling system based on $x_n$ satisfies the PNT. (2) If $x_n=p_n+g(n)$ then assuming RH, the Beurling system based on $x_n$ satisfies the assertion of the RH. (3)If $x_n=p_n+h(n)$ then assuming Cramér's conjecture, the Beurling system based on $x_n$ satisfies the assertion of Cramér conjecture. 

I would expect that the answer for the Dedekind problem on the number of simplicial complexes on $n$ labelled vertices should essentially give the right behavior (doubly exponential with $n$) also for homotopy type. (The difference between labelled and unlabelled vertices is at most $n!$ so it is negligible.) 

The "No free lunch" (NFL) theorem from mathematical optimization was used by William Dembski to disprove Darwinian theory of evolution. (The relevance of NFL's theorem to evolution was proposed earlier by Stuart Kauffman.) Olle Haggstrom wrote a paper debunking Dembski's argument. (Here is an early version with stronger rhetorics.) 

This is a very nice question and following Greg's lead I will try to offer some thoughts about it. First it may well be possible that a theory of "singular CW homology" can be created. (But we need to think about motivation as well.) 2) While singular d-dimentional simplices (or cubes) are complicated objects their "(d-1)"-dimensional facets and thus also their (algebraic) boundary are well defined. For a CW complex this depends on the attaching maps and is much more complicated. (To Mark's comment: The boundary of a cell can be the union of two cells or one cell or even just 0 but the general situation is complex.) 3) There are some intermediate objects to consider: Regular CW complexes has the property that the closure of an open cell is a closed cell and their homology can be computed from the combinatorics of the cells. (This is not the case for general CW complexes.) So maybe singular regular-CW homology can be a good point to start. 4) One more thing: Suppose you want to have a theory that allows singular simplices and also singular cubes (so this is a much more modest task). How do you do it? Edit: Mark Grant has proposed in a comment a very interesting version of cellular-singular homology. Instead of looking at the sequence of d-simplices and singular d-simplices or at the sequence of d-cubes and singular d-cubes look at the following very simple cell structures. Consider d-balls whose boundary is a (d-1)-spheres built from two (d-1)-cells, etc. I dont know if this version of singular homology was considered but it certainly looks very natural. 

Video1, Video2, Video3, Video4 Postnikov's ten minutes explanation of the amplituhedron starts here. Update: Some more details and links can be found in the blog post The simplex, the cyclic polytope, the positroidron, the amplituhedron and beyond. 

A famous example of a geometry which violates the triangle inequality is $\ell_2^2$, namely the distance between two points is defined as the square of their Euclidean distance. There is also much interesrt in metric spaces that do satisfy the triangle inequality which are subsets of $\ell_2^2$. Those are called "metric spaces of negative types". (Indeed, sumetimes the notation $\ell_2^2$ refer to a metric space which is a subset of $\ell_2^2$ as defined above.) There was a conjecture by Goemens and by Linial asserting that every metric space in $\ell_2^2$ can be embedded with constant distortion into $\ell_1$. This was disproved in a spectacular paper by Khot and Vishnoi. 

11. Issues concerning high school mathematics There is some efforts to promote interest in mathematics among gifted high school students: special mathematical journal (in Hebrew), some "clubs" and "summer camps" math Olympiads etc. I think this had some factor in promoting math among young people. Usually, what it takes is some mathematician in academics which is devoted to this issue and some (not large) budget. Giving an incentive for such an activity and such a mathematician may be a good idea. Popular Math books and text books in Hebrew had substantial influence. A. Frankel (the set theorist) wrote wonderful five-volume Hebrew books introducing mathematics (It was called "An Introduction to Mathematics") in the 40s/50s. (More recently, the Hebrew edition of Singh's book on Wiles proof of FLT increased popularity of mathematics.) 

Helly theorem. It is easy to motivate state and prove in 30 minutes. It is very useful in terms of application as a fundamental example of a result in combinatorial geometry. 

There are several surprises regarding convex polytopes: A) There are combinatorial types of polytopes that cannot be realized with rational coordinates (first discovered by Perles). This is not the case in three dimension but by now there are examples in every dimension greater equal 4. This adds to several examples on the wild combinatorial nature of convex polytopes in dim at least 4. B) The applications of commutative algebra to the study of face-numbers of polytopes - Stanley proofs of the upper bound theorem using the Cohen-Macaulay argument and many subsequent results. Also surprising is the application of algebraic geometry: toric varieties, Hard Lefschetz theorem, intersection homology etc. C) It is a special surprise that some proofs regarding the face number of polytopes applies only to polytopes with rational coordinates. 

The classification of finite simple groups This theorem describes completely all finite simple groups: A finite simple group is either cyclic groups of prime order, alternating groups, groups of Lie type (included some twisted families), or one of 26 sporadic simple group. The proof extends over many paper by many people. The completion of the project was announced in 1983, but some incomplete part was replaced by a complete proof only more recently. There was a project for major revised and simplified proof but it was also very hard. Here is a link to a review paper of Solomon. (The answer was suggested by Victor Protsak.) 

One important class of examples is toric varieties where it gives a nice formula for the intersection homology. (Shubert veraieties and the Kazhdan Luzstig polynomials is another example but I am not sure the decomposition theorem is needed, (the connection with IH was earlier). I think there are many further results in representation theory where the theorem is used a lot.) 

I looked at the various MO example questions and did not indentify a clear chimera. A possible answer perhaps for helping make the term "mathematical chimera" cleared is the set of cardinal numbers as built from successor cardinals (which somehow resembles positive integers) and then 0 and the limit cardinals which look like a part of a different animal. Jim is it remotely close to what you asked? 

I am familiar with a few more examples of various types. I think that in order to be useful we can think about various different types of "computer aided experimental mathematics". A) Conjectures obtained from computer experimentations. 1) A famous example is Feigenbaum's discovery: (Quote from the wikipedia article) "Some mathematical mappings involving a single linear parameter exhibit the apparently random behavior known as chaos when the parameter lies within certain ranges. As the parameter is increased towards this region, the mapping undergoes bifurcations at precise values of the parameter. At first there is one stable point, then bifurcating to an oscillation between two values, then bifurcating again to oscillate between four values and so on. In 1975, Dr. Feigenbaum, using the small HP-65 calculator he had been issued, discovered that the ratio of the difference between the values at which such successive period-doubling bifurcations occur tends to a constant of around 4.6692... He was then able to provide a mathematical proof of that fact, and he then showed that the same behavior, with the same mathematical constant, would occur within a wide class of mathematical functions, prior to the onset of chaos. For the first time, this universal result enabled mathematicians to take their first steps to unravelling the apparently intractable "random" behavior of chaotic systems. This "ratio of convergence" is now known as the first Feigenbaum constant." 2) There are various mathematical packages with more "general-purpose" experimentation in various fields and some of those have led to interesting conjectures. B) Computerized proof 1) Also here there are several examples of different nature. In some cases (like Hales proof of the density packing conjecture) verifying the proof requires full replication of the experiment. In some other cases, like the proof of Cohn and Kumar for the densest lattice in 24 dimensions, checking an automated proof can be carried out (again usually using computers) with less effort compared to the effort in finding the proof. 2) There are computer packages which allow more "general-purpose" forming-conjectures-and-proving-them in various (still quite restricted) areas. 

Here is another perspective from theoretical computer science. Sperner's theorem represents the complexity class PPAD; This complexity class (described by Christos Papadimitriou) is represented also by finding approximate fix points and several important applications of the fixed-point theorem are known to be PPAD-complete, most famously computing Nash equilibrium of (even 2-players) games. Here is a nice introduction to PPAD by Paul Goldberg, that I found in the post "Brower, Sperner and PPAD$ in this course site of Noam Nisan. 

There is quite a lot that can be said about the Charney-Davis conjecture, so let me say a few things and perhaps add more later. 1) The conjecture is a discrete analogue of a well known conjecture by Hopf on the Euler characteristic of nonpositively curved manifolds in odd dimension. You consider cubical complexes and the condition of nonpositive curvature is replaced (the CAT version) by the condition that all links of vertices (which are simplicial spheres to start with) are flag. (Namely they are the clique complexes of their 1-skeletons.) 2) The original formulation is in terms of the h-vectors and it says that if K is a flag complex which is a sphere of dimension d-1, and d=2e, then 

Some habits of thoughts in mathematics which are useful outside mathematics are: Quantitative thinking - Often it is very important to understand quantitative aspects of an issue. Logical thinking - Mathematics is a very clear platform for precise logical thinking. Computational thinking - Often we need to make some computations, to write some formulas and manipulate them, in order to address an issue probabilistic thinking - The ability to think about luck, chance, risks and decisions in probabilistic terms and to draw insights from probability theory is important in many areas 

This is a very natural and good question. If you want to widen the applications of Gower's norms and higher Fourier analysis to topics like discrete isoperimetry, and applications to probability and TOC (where ordinary Fourier analysis is useful) and perhaps also to improved bounds for error-correcting codes, then having analogs for Parseval's formula may be crucial. Balazs Szegedy's paper "On higher order Fourier analysis" also have a sort of Perseval's formula for higher Fourier. There is a chapter there on higher order Fourier decompositions and higher order dual groups. 

The cyclic polytope in the study of convex polytopes in high dimensions. It is the convex hull of n points on the moment curve (t,t^2,t^3,...,t^d). It is simplicial and has the property that every [d/2] points form a face. (So, for example, in 4 dimension every two vertices form an edge.) 

This is a hat problem I heard only two days ago: you have a hundred people and each one has a (natural) number between 1 and 100 written on his hat. (Numbers may repeat.) As ususal, everybody can see only the numbers on other people's hats. Give these guys a strategy for guessing so that at least one will surely make the right guess. (They do not hear each other guesses.) 

I have some experience of teaching a course in Mathematics for libearal arts and social science students. It was called last year "the beauty of mathematics". Here is a blog post about the course, and the course page which contains all the presentation (in Hebrew). The main topics of the course were Numbers: irrational numbers, imaginary numbers, different representations of numbers, prime numbers and their properties. Shapes: Geometry from two dimensions to many dimensions. Infinity: The concept of infinity. The paradox of motion. How to add up infinitly many numbers. Riddles: Mathematical puzzles and riddles. Models: Mathematical models as the gate to science. Probability: The mathematics of luck. Games: mathematical games and the theory of games. Mathematics in social sciences. Of course, there is much to be chosen from and it is quite important not to squeeze too much to a single course.
