If you can't get something recommended by the manufacturer, you may be able to find something suitable by taking measurements or reading the size off the existing seat post. Sheldon brown has a database of seatpost sizes, but sadly it doesn't seem to include Viking or Hopper. I guess there are three things you should look for: 

I'm trying to swap the cranks on our Thorn tandem and would like to know what kind of crank extractor (if any) I need for the job. Is there a way to tell from this photo, before I've taken it all apart? EDIT: Photo updated after cap removed (sorry it's a bit blurry). Centre has a thread, is that what I'd screw into and pull?

However, it's worth remembering that exercising in polluted areas is still better than not exercising at all. Try the same sprint somewhere less polluted and see if there's a difference. 

As long as you've got your key with you - some of them stay in the lock when it's unlocked - it's easy. No more excuses! 

YMMV, but I find the Rohloff to be efficient and simple to use. We use it on a tandem, so it may be that the pause needed when shifting is less distruptive on a solo bike. However, I also expect that an experienced racer would be able to shift their high-spec gears much more quickly and efficiently than any hub gears and that this might mean that deraileurs are the only option for racing. That and the fact that you can't seem to connect them to brifters. 

The answer given above is substantially correct but it is also worth noting that failure of lever 2 - the upshift lever on the ErgoPower - is significantly more frequent if: A non QS FD is used with a QS lever A non Campagnolo crankset is in use, even if the FD and lever "match". As the main Campagnolo factory-appointed Warranty and Service Centre for the UK, we can assure you that the above answer is correct. 

No, Anonymous Donor is wrong, I am afraid - you will find that the chainrings on the 11s cranks are effectively closer together and you may well get issues with the chain touching the outer ring when you are on the inner ring and the smallest 2 or possibly even 3 sprockets (depends on the frame geometry). Sometimes this just causes noise and it's an irritation only, other times the lift pins on the inside of the outer ring will pick the bottom run of chain up & you will get a chain-suck type effect that can do a lot of damage. Front mech set up is also sightly more difficult although that can be persuaded to work - it won't work as well, though, as a full 10s system and you may get chainn-drop issues going from big to small ring, and "float" issues coming back up from small to big ring. Compact is available in 10s, in the current range with Veloce and there are still quite a few vendors advertising Centaur 10s if you want a lighter, carbon chainset. 

The problem is that you have the cable incorrectly routed under the pinch bolt / washer. You need to route the cable down the same "side" of the pinch bolt, but the washer needs to turn 90 degrees clockwise, so that one "claw" sits in the hole in the derailleur body, one "claw" sits outside the derailleur body next to the free end of the cable and the cable itself should be trapped, in a straight line, under the small extended flange on the washer that has a groove cut in it, for that purpose. You might need to use a new cable as the way you have it clamped, it's forced a "kink" into it which will probably not straighten out fully and so will always affect the cable tension, slightly, so giving you inaccurate shifting. 

I used the Oakley prescription M-Frame for years, quite happily, but discovered a few details that may help you. Initially, one of my lenses wasn't correct, and it took the eye shop a few minutes to figure it out because they couldn't measure the prescription off the lens like they normally do. The M-Frame (and probably other cycling glasses) curve so much that Oakley has to run the prescription through their own formula to define the grinding. It works great and gives you a beautifully wide field of clear vision, but somebody hand-transposed my astigmatism correction from 180 degrees to 108 degrees at Oakley. They fixed it without hassle. Also, due to the curve of the M-Frame, the prescription lenses are an insert in a shield that has holes for them to pop into. Looks slightly funny, but not bad, and they look great from your view. The caveat is that the shield would always develop a small crack below the lens, likely due to different amounts of flex in the lens and shield. I dubbed them "Broke-leys", because I had to send them back in several times for repair, but they never argued with me and eventually I went the Lasik route and left the problem behind. Here's what the M-Frame insert approach looks like: 

I'm also using a Garmin now that has a crank sensor so it calculates it the right way. Still, the biggest number on the screen is always my cadence. Both screens. Wireless: Don't worry about interference. Never experienced it. Even in road race bunches and group rides. Never had a problem establishing and keeping wireless connections. This in over a decade using Specialized and Shimano bike computers, and now a couple years on a Garmin using ANT+. Pretty sure the old Polar coded HRM never had trouble either that couldn't be explained away by my chest hair being a bigger source of interference than the wireless. Wired computer cables can break. I may be paranoid there since I've avoided them for longer than I used them (and I did use them for a while). I always remove computers and lights before locking a bike (I am certainly paranoid there), but have never worried about somebody wanting to steal the mounts and sensors. Just don't park by the jr high. There's always some jerk there who just wants to break other people's stuff and won't care how cheap it is to fix. 

I've had my SPD touring shoes for about seven years. The cleats are the originals and are now quite worn and I noticed recently that one of them (not pictured) is at a rather wacky angle that can't be doing my pedalling action any good. As the shoes are more or less OK, I'd like to replace the cleats. The problem is that the cleat bolts (hex-shaped) are jammed with grit, mud, stones and whatever else I've walked on in the past 7 years. So the allen key won't go in. 

I've ridden the bike like this, without a stoker and it does take some extra care due to the weight high up, especially at low speed and when pushing/parking the bike. In this photo I have the rear brake locked on with a strap, to stop the bike slipping. If you were certain you'd never have a stoker riding then, depending on the frame design, you could probably attach it to the captain's seat tube, but on a tandem it can be helpful to have a bit of weight over the back wheel for traction. I know that doesn't exactly answer your question, but hopefully it's some help. 

I'm surprised no one has mentioned brake blocks. In my experience these wear faster than tyres or chain. I get maybe 800-1000 miles from a set of brake blocks. I've now switched to the v-brake "insert" kind, which are marginally cheaper and much quicker to replace. Always carry replacements and keep an eye on wear. When they are nearly worn down, carry two full sets (front and back). 

The most common measurement I've seen is c-c (centre to centre), the distance between the two horizontal tops of the drops, running parallel with the stem and behind the hoods. If that doesn't make sense, see the following image. 

The ring spacings are incorrect and you also have to be careful with the physical thickness of the rings because they are supported on two sides. The ring spacing is set by where the teeth are machined on the section of the material - so on a 9s ring, the teeth are pretty much in the middle. On a 10s they are dished towards the big ring but there is still a narrow shoulder towards the big ring "side". 11s chainrings, the teeth are machined flush with the surface closest to the big ring. This affects how the front mech works and the probability of chain drop going from big to small ring, so it's not recommended to use 11s rings with anything other than a full 11s system. Additionally, on a compact, because the rings are physically closer to each other, the wider 10s chain tends to catch on the back of the big ring if you are cross-chained on the small - this can lead to an effect that looks like chain suck which in turn can damage the paintwork of your frame, the chain, the chainring or all three - so it's a pretty bad idea all round. Some Campag 10s cranksets used thinner rings than others which puts a "wriggle" in the ring behind the crank if the chainring thicknesses don't match - that can lead to the chain dropping off the big ring onto the small if you are cross chained and the effect gets worse the more worn the system gets. 

Depends on the version. Oldest version with a 4mm allen head bolt in black is LEFT HAND THREAD ... all the more recent are standard RH thread. As head tech at Campag's main UK Technical Centre I have never seen a seized bolt in an ErgoPower lever and we service between 10 and 15 a month at this time of year - I've done several 100 in the last 25 years, since ErgoPower was introduced ... 

Granted this answer is not for everyone, but it is simple for tandem riders. As the helmsman/captain I wear a Camelbak with elastic webbing which holds the OS map conveniently in front of the stoker (I have a photo somewhere). I get funny looks when I walk into shops with a map on my back, though. If the scale is large enough it can be read while pedalling, although I'm sometimes told to keep still so gradient lines can be read. 

You can get use quick release (QR) skewers for the wheels and saddle, and it may be possible to use these on your handlebars, (maybe even the front derailleur?), depending on whether the design allows for a larger nut. I doubt this would help with brake levers/shifters. The part would have to be specially designed to have a quick-release cable. Quick release pedals might be possible, but it would have to be a very reliable mechanism, given the force they're under and the consequences of losing one whilst riding. Overall I'm not sure if would be that large a deterrent. I understand that the more serious bike thief comes with a van, slings the bike(s) in the back, taking them away and selling the parts on Ebay. So a missing set of pedals would only make it marginally less attractive. 

Does this imply that the correct nipple to go with them would be 15 gauge? I assume that the thicker gauge is at the outer ends, if I've understood butting correctly. 

These are less important on a relatively short and slow urban commute. I have both a drop-bar bike and a flat-bar bike. Although the drop-bar bike is faster and more comfortable than the flat bar hybrid and overall does more distance in a year, I prefer the hybrid for commuting across town. A large part of the reason I choose the hybrid for commuting is the bar style.
