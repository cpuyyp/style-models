Can a non-falsifiable belief be useful? Picture this thought experiment: You have a "lucky" friend. When people are around him, things seem to go better. One person wins the lottery, another one meets his future wife, etc. For the purposes of the example, let's assume the effect IS real, but unpredictable. This belief isn't falsifiable, because it doesn't have a predictable impact. But in the aggregate it was useful, because the people who believed in it ended up having better lives (whether or not they know they did). Clearly, this is a contrived example, but it establishes a theoretical base case. Similarly, if I believe in God, I am judging that I live in a meaningful universe with a moral foundation. If that is a correct belief, it is a useful one. It might arguably be a useful belief even if incorrect. How can such belief be communicated/taught to someone who isn't already favorably biased? In many traditions, you don't so much communicate your belief as you guide someone into a state of readiness to embrace belief. Ultimately you're just facilitating the relationship between the person and God, you aren't creating or controlling it. How can competing notions of God coexist? They can't always coexist, but in the cases they can, I think epistemic humility is the key. Let's say you and I both believe there is a giant mountain, shrouded in mist, that can be seen from both of our houses. Some people believe the mountain doesn't actually exist, it's just an illusion caused by shadows in the mist. But you and I both think we've been lucky enough to have seen it clearly during a rare time when the mist was thinner. As it so happens, we have serious disagreements about some of the characteristics of the mountain. Some of the disagreements might be because we are viewing the mountain from different locations --seeing different sides of it. Other disagreements might be because it's hard to see through the mist --one or both of us might be wrong. But we could potentially at least agree that the mountain does exist, and that we are both talking about the same mountain, even while I legitimately believe you are wrong and I am right about some of the mountain's most notable features. 

It might seem like promiscuity is victimless, but in fact, in the larger overall social picture, promiscuous sexual contact is a) a significant disease vector (there are many serious diseases which spread primarily or exclusively through sexual contact) and b) likely to result in poor parenting outcomes for several reasons (unwanted children, children with undesirable partners, weakening of the social bond between fathers and their children), at least in the case of heterosexual promiscuity. For those two reasons, there are strong prohibitions against promiscuity in most traditional moral frameworks. In the modern era there are reasonably reliable methods of preventing or reducing both sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancies. This lessens the social harm of promiscuity --at least in the case where the methods are used consistently and effectively. However, this doesn't mean that it's possible for everyone to immediately readjust, either socioculturally or biologically. Not everyone is well-suited to experiencing the emotional intimacy of sexual contact with large numbers of partners. 

Do you define a lie as "a deliberate attempt to deceive" or as "a statement counter to the facts"? We can presume your statement to the police was a deliberate attempt to deceive, even if it was technically not a statement counter to the facts. This type of situation is the reason behind the fact that people in a court of law are required to swear to tell the "truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth." --the phrase the whole truth recognizes the existence of half truths intended to deceive. As far as the seeming paradox: In natural language, there are many ambiguities, and two exploited by this dilemma are the fuzziness of the definition of "lie" and the fuzziness of the definition of "beard." In a formalized language, on the other hand, ambiguities are eliminated and statements are given exact truth values. Since your statement was not in a formalized language, it is not unusual that it has an ambiguous truth value (see logician Tarksi for more on the subject). 

In general, what you're talking about probably falls best under Game Theory Ethics. This is the application of game theory to morality. (Game theory is the attempt to bring systematic analysis to bear on choice-making situations where the impact of the choices of one decision-maker or "agent" is affected or altered by the choices of the other agent or agents within the "game," which may or may not be an actual game as we typically understand the word). In particular, the specific question you're talking about seems closely related to the Tragedy of the Commons, a name for the tendency of selfish individuals to act against the best interests of the group, even to their own eventual detriment. With all that said, neither Christ nor Buddha preached in a world where everyone --or anyone really --could be reasonably expected to "play by the rules." If they had, their messages would have been superfluous. Also, and in point of fact, non-violent activism (for example) has proven quite effective in the face of superior force and conditions of hostility, such as under the leadership of Gandhi in the Indian independence movement, or under the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the American civil rights movement. It certainly hasn't relied on presuppositions of a shared commitment to nonviolence by the other side. In summary, the circumstance of trying to follow a moral rule under hostile conditions, and in the presence of those who do not share that rule is NOT a special case, but rather the standard general circumstances of anyone who ever commits to follow moral rules. That being the case, the majority of anything ever written on the subject of morality is relevant to your question. 

Now you can see that in a way they are being defined interchangeably. However it seems that what separates the two are a matter of perspective and understanding of its context. Ironically what brings more light to this difference are the synonyms. Observe that while some of the synonyms are the same, given the way they are defined not a real surprise, there are key differences in there that if they were truly the same would not happen. The primary differences are: 

So simply put, mathematics can indeed be art as well as the foundation for beauty, symmetry and organizational foundation of building or drawing in general. 

The connection between mathematics and art goes back thousands of years. Mathematics has been used in the design of Gothic cathedrals, Rose windows, oriental rugs, mosaics and tilings. Geometric forms were fundamental to the cubists and many abstract expressionists, and award-winning sculptors have used topology as the basis for their pieces. Dutch artist M.C. Escher represented infinity, MÃ¶bius bands, tessellations, deformations, reflections, Platonic solids, spirals, symmetry, and the hyperbolic plane in his works. Mathematicians and artists continue to create stunning works in all media and to explore the visualization of mathematics--origami, computer-generated landscapes, tesselations, fractals, anamorphic art, and more. AMS One of the most commonly observed art created by mathematics is the various algorithms that organically create fractals and patterns for example. Consider Fractal Geometry. Creation of natural objects normally the subject of artwork through a mathematical formula is just as artistic: 

I have been a hacker and programmer since I was 14 and I have done advanced education and research in Artificial Intelligence. We all know that we do not yet have a computer entity that is "truly" intelligent since all have to conform to their coding and logic proposed by the programmer(s) therefore limited by the scope of those instructions. However, let's assume for the sake of argument that one of those machines becomes sentient, like humans. It thinks for itself, by itself and without any reliance on programmatic logic. It would be considered a new lifeform; albeit created by man. Here is my question: If god has made us in his own image and therefore is God because he created us, does that also mean that if we as humans create a sentient lifeform from say Artificial Intelligence, would we be considered it's God? I ask because if the premise for God is that he/she/it created us, then by all standards we would be God as we have created a sentient being. So in essence, we are to it as god is to us, right? 

Mathematics is considered a universal language because the principles which it holds are the same no matter what. 10 of something is 10 of that thing no matter where you are, what you speak, and how you write it. This is the reason why the SETI project has been broadcasting mathematical formulas on multiple bases ensuring that the recipient will understand at least one of them if not all of them like we do. Because math is a fundamental building block foundation, any civilization or lifeform will have to have a form of it. This means that at that level, they will have math and can communicate back to establish a cipher for bilateral communication. They can choose base number system 2 binary (how computers communicate) 3 ternary 4 quaternary 5 quinary 6 senary 7 septenary 8 octal 9 nonary 10 decimal (how we commonly refer to real numbers) 11 undenary 12 duodecimal 16 hexadecimal (again commonly used in programming and computer hardware) 20 vigesimal (Aztecs and Mayans used this for planetary positions) 60 sexagesimal (used by the Babylonians and still used to measure time) and even if they use one that is not here, when we send them the same value on all of these bases, they can use it to calculate what it would be on their math base and send it back allowing us to figure out the base and establish a key. This is absolutely critical in foundation of language and basic communication with unknown languages, similar to the techniques used to decipher hieroglyphs, ancient Persian tablets and so on. This is how we decipher dead languages on our planet, so it will be applied to any new intelligence in the universe and if they are intelligent enough to be communicating with us or even receiving us, then they have reached a development stage allowing them to comprehend and adapt. Now that being said, given that math and geometry are steps toward understanding elements of physics, they would have come to the same conclusions as we have over the years. They may have come to them at different order, with different level of specificity and by different names, but the principles of the physical universe would be observed. Now barring a silicone based lifeform able to live on the surface of a red giant and breath sulfur, we can safely assume the same rules of physical universe would apply to them as well. 

Well this has been subject to various philosophical debates for a very long time. If you look at the definition of the two terms, you will get what seems like a circular answer. One refers to the other and the other refers back, case in point: 

The trend of the differences for duty seem to imply that some part of the social contract is responsible for it. Duty to vote can be a burden to some and liability to others (the disenfranchised vs. those seeking future political office). Calling to be a soldier, cop, doctor, journalist, humanitarian, activist, etc etc (suggesting a familial trend - my father, his father, and his father ^n was a soldier so its my calling to serve, etc). So we can say perhaps that DUTY is born out of ideology or social contract which motivates the action with a sense of implied greater purpose. Now looking at the differences for obligation seem to imply imposition of some of kind of responsibility out of legal, moral, or religious rules/laws. Obligation to obey traffic rules, caring for your offsprings, going to church, academic honor to not plagiarize or cheat, do not steal, do not kill, etc, you get the idea. We can perhaps see that obligation tends to come out of legal responsibility, moral or religious beliefs. The differences may seem subtle but they do include nuances that may be significant to how the individual behavior is guided.
