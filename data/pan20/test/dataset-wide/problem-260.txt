From what I read in comments I see a bit of confusion, but I believe this setup can be made workable without resorting to magic. 

The number in itself has no meaning and even less value. The process to derive it, if rigorous enough, could be very helpful indeed. What you really need is a way to move resources from one sector to another in order to maximize the number. This is done very badly "on paper" and this is the real reason of (initial) Apple success: the first program readily enabling to do this kind of calculations (the first spreadsheet) "VisiCalc", but I'm digressing. For sure you need to, in some way, approximate this computation in order to manage the colony development. It is one of the "modern" discoveries that many interactions in complex systems are highly counter-intuitive and thus the development of a series of tools (from the above cited VisiCalc down) to help managers, at all levels, to take their decisions. If useful to your plot you can devise a specific "plan office" where some skilled humans will emulate this "optimization" process "by hand". Bear in mind the whole process will start as a very rough model and will be refined over the time, along with techniques for multi-variate maximization. You need something similar to what has been done in early '70s by "Club of Rome" to give a rough estimate to The_Limits to Growth (it has been heavily ridiculed at the time, but many of graphs proved somewhat true, unfortunately). Reliability of computations in a small and culturally compact colony would be much more reliable than what possible in a 7billion+ inhabitants world with many conflicting entities. 

Depending on the effect you want to implement into your plot you could use a laryngophone to reliably pick up whispers in a noisy environment (currently available technology) or rely on subvocalization assisted by sound restoration techniques (likely feasible today, but not an off-the-shelf product). In both cases you can then encode, compress, crypt and transmit resulting stream and send it where you need it. A technology to "turn down volume" of human voice from outside AFAIK is not available (unless you want to use some "noise canceling" technology with an apparatus very near to speaker's mouth. It depends on what you really want; a noise canceling apparatus coupled with a laryngophone could be what you need, but it needs to be on speaker body; I'm not aware of a way to do this "from remote" (i.e.: to point a "silencer gun" to someone and kill his voice). 

There's a significant advantage to holding a sword with two hands, and your four-arms guys could do that and still hold a shield (or two shields). The advantage of holding a sword with two hands instead of one is leverage, which gives much greater strength and control. It either allows wielding a longer and heavier sword with the same strength and control as a shorter one in one hand, or allows wielding a more normal-sized sword with more quick movements and better leverage than one-handed. Your four-arms guys have all the advantages of a two-handed swordsman but not the main disadvantage: the lack of a shield. So oddly enough I think your four-armed men would do very well going into battle with a single large sword or mace held with both the arms of one side, and a shield or shields on the other side. Although you'd think using the conventional setup would be a waste of their unique traits, that wouldn't be the case at all. They'd wield the sword and shield with much greater strength and agility than other men. They'd be extremely hard to face by a man with two arms. When going up against a two-handed swordsman, you can't sword-fight with them, because their sword blows are just much stronger than yours. You try to catch their sword on your shield and then stab when they're exposed (because they have no shield). But your quad-arms have that same two-handed sword advantage...and also a shield. An even deadlier setup might be a greatsword in the two right arms, a shield in one left arm, and a light stabbing sword in the other left arm. Swing the greatsword, they get knocked hard, but catch on shield, they thrust with their sword, you deflect with your shield, and finish them with the stabbing weapon you had tucked behind the shield. 

The B-2 bomber is still classified technology, even though it is now deployed in service. People can see it flying around, but there are still many secrets to its design: 

The easiest is to copy actual human physiology. Human females normally (it's not a hard rule, but it "generally" works this way) don't undergo menstrual cycle (i.e.: no ovulation) while breast feeding. Other species exhibit the same behaviors (e.g.: cats). Make fathers also breast-feed (possibly a different kind of "milk") and the child to require both of them to reach maturity and you have all triggers you need. 

There's a very rough estimate of "intelligence" (an already quite fuzzy concept) via "encephalization quotient" (quotient between brain mass and average body mass), but it's not universally accepted and I'm very unsure if it would apply to OGM soldiers. Truth is we only have a vague idea of what is considered "intelligence" and where it resides. Experts tend to divide different "components" of what we commonly refer as intelligence and stress fact they seem unrelated but synergic (which looks like an oxymoron, but isn't). Reasoning behind the "encephalization quotient" is a large part of brain is used for "normal maintenance" and generic body control (simple acts as walking require a lot of precise regulations of almost all muscles we own integrated with continuous feedback of literally billions of sensors) and the larger the body (we speak about lean mass, a fat person does not became more stupid) the more "objects" you need to monitor and control; only the "excess brain mass" may contribute to "exotic" functions like language for humans or sonar for dolphins. Bottom line: without specific interventions your "super-soldiers" would be about as intelligent as the next man or fractionally brighter. Truth is current neuroscience is still unable to pinpoint (in a scientific way) what and where is what makes us "intelligent", so it's difficult to say what would increase it. Actually doing such a thing is yet another level again. Question why a dictator would want super-intelligent soldiers who would more easily see through propaganda and refuse to become cannon fodder is, of course, another matter. 

AFAIK the definition itself of specie is about the possibility to have fertile offspring. If you state there are different species they "by definition" won't have fertile children. If you have fertile offspring then the two divergent lines are called "races" (even if the term has been abused in the past, so it's very "politically incorrect" to use it). If your humanoids drifted away enough (millions of years seem more than enough, as our species seems to have branched out from our cousins about 7My ago) there would be little to no chance to have any offspring (like trying to hybridize a man with a chimpanzee or a chimpanzee with a gorilla). If they drifted less (~< 2My) then cross-breeding would be possible, but infertile (like mule or ligre). Even less drift (~ 500Ky) would allow (to be verified) also fertile offspring. You can have whatever suits your plot just trimming accordingly the amount of time the various communities remained separate. Of course the ability of mating (in the sense of having sex together) has little to do with the effective results; again you can chose as it suits best your story. 

So we know that a government can, through the methods used on the B-2, create a technology that no one else knows much of anything about. Why they would do that for fusion is up to your story. I can't tell you why people in your story make choices, but if you are looking for inspiration, there are a couple possibilities: Dominance through simple energy superiority and independence: Countries succeed by leveraging resources. Sources of energy have become one of the most important resources. Fossil fuels are a big deal. Countries that have it or can get it prosper. Those who can't fall behind. If your country has fusion but others do not, you race ahead of them, making yourself a dominant power. You can make fusion-powered war machines and they can't. Your electricity is so cheap that manufacturers start moving operations to your country, boosting your economy. They wouldn't make that move if fusion will soon be coming to their current location. Your street lights and electric trains run for almost free. Your citizens can charge their electric cars for almost free. Your GDP would explode. If you share this tech, then the world advances together. If you withhold it, then you pull far ahead of the others. Keep control of the reactors, but sell the electricity for money and political or strategic deals. The superpower that has the fusion tech under government control could make deals to sell the power output, but not the tech itself, to other countries. If another country wants to be able to buy the cheap power, they have to give the superpower some land (of the superpower's choosing). The superpower will build a reactor and also a military base on that land. The reactor will be on super-power sovereign territory, and protected by the base, but the small nation's power grid can connect some power lines to the output. This is a sweet deal for the superpower. They get to build new military outposts and also sell electricity. Since the small nation is now dependent on the electricity, they are close to being a vassal-state of the superpower, who can threaten to cut the power if they misbehave. 

In this schema "virus" would act as contrast-enhancer for the long-range sensors (probably in microwave range). 

The easiest and more effective is to pull your moon nearer to planet so it will have a larger apparent size and you'll get both more frequent and longer lasting eclipses. You will be limited by Roche limit, but there's ample margin as this, for real Earth/Moon system is a scant 34,638km radius while real moon orbit is about 384,399km away, which is 21 times the Roche limit. Note that, as you pull Moon in you'll get three effects together: 

In this scenario technology is going to fall hard and no resources for research are going to be spared for a long time (till population is in the tens of millions ballpark). This would follow our own world development model where large industries and associated technology improvements is fueled by "numbers"; i.e.: if you haven't a (very) large customer base. This might mean a couple of millenniums will pass without radical technological improvements. Note: in the last scenario it's very likely colony will never get in par with motherland (unless communications get better) because in the meantime motherland technology would have improved and catching-up is not going to be easy. 

It is very likely that there will be a dual-system. Something completely artificial, but precise, most likely a Real number (floating-point) like "stardate" (number of days, fractional; roughly equivalent to one wake/sleep cycle) or "unix" (number of seconds, fractional in recent incarnations; as a short period, close to a "least common" unit). In this things like months or years bear no meaning and probably would be dropped. Something local, bearing resemblance with the planet at hand; there days and longer units linked to seasons would be needed. Absolute precision is not a requirement, but long term stability is. 

Europa oceans are water with still largely unknown amount of solutes. Bottom is, at least, as deep as Marianne fault, possibly ten times more (depends on model, scientists didn't make up their mind, yet). This is a very unfriendly environment for most likely metals. Plastic and glass/ceramic might fare a bit better. Keeping airtight anything sizable for extended periods of time (> 1 year) would be unfeasible with current materials. Starfaring races may have something better, but I cannot know how much. Your best bet is to have the spaceship melt some of the ice at the bottom (either leaking heat or mechanically); soon after ice would form again making a preserving cocoon. In this conditions it's likely it could be preserved for long time (centuries or more) almost intact.
