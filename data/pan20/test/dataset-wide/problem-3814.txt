The theorem is actually presented in full details in Cassels, but it is a bit hard to equate to Conway. First, note that a genus symbol as in Conway-Sloane directly describes a sum of Jordan factors. Then apply Cassels's theorem about the existence of forms in genera given the right local factors, and the fact that the determinant and Hilbert reciprocity are the only conditions on existence of a rational form locally isomorphic to given local forms. 

This answer shows maybe. Pick a parameter $s$. We will precompute $2n$ Bloom filters with false positive rate $s$ and size $g(s)$ such that $B_{i,0}$, $B_{i,1}$ such that $k \in B_{i,b}$ if $m_{i,k}=b$. This takes time $O(g(s)mn)$ Our algorithm is as follows: we will intersect the $\sqrt{n}$ bloom filters (time $O(g(s)\sqrt{n})$) and then look within in that set for the answer. This takes time $O((1+s)\sqrt{n})$ Total time for $t$ operations is $O(g(s)mn+t(g(s)+1+s)\sqrt{n})$. If you can pick a better $s$ for $t$, then yes. Why is the false positive rate not larger for the intersection? Because the intersection of the Bloom filters is exactly the Bloom filter of the intersection. I don't think the adversary can do much about picking the worst row, but that takes some more analysis. 

Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix with even diagonal and elements in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and nonzero discriminant. (Yes, $p$ can be two) and $a$ an nonzero integer. Suppose there exists a solution to $x^{\top}Ax/2=a$ where $x$ is a primitive vector. Is there an explicit $\delta>0$ depending only on $A$ and $a$ such that if $\Vert a_{ij}-c_{ij} \Vert<\delta$ and $C$ has the same determinant as $A$ then $x^{\top}Cx/2=a$ will have a primitive solution? 

Here is a trick that might help: Compute $\sqrt{5}D$ as $\sqrt{5}(D+R)-\sqrt{5}R$ where $R$ is in the large set you know how to compute. 

The difficulty here is the exact definition of PRF. A PRF is a function $f(k,x)$ which is computationally indistinguishable from a random function of $x$ when we pick $k$ randomly. This does not mean $f(k,x)$ for a fixed $k$ is a random function. The other obstacle is that we do not know any PRFs, only conjectured ones. There are very few unconditional results in cryptography. 

As far as I know the question of outliers is a very difficult one. You need a model of the process that produces the data, and argue that the underlying process is better behaved than the data, so there is a rare mistake in some outlying point. Given this it is a mixture model to be fit. There are issues about biases introduced through this method, and fitting distributions is very annoying from a statistics perspective due to measure theory issues. You might try robust statistics to avoid being sensitive to outliers, without the issues of chopping data after looking at it. You could also determine the sensitivity of your procedure to each piece of data, and see if excluding 54 gets significantly different results from excluding other entries. 

For genus $1$ any supersingular elliptic curve will have trace of Frobenius $0$, and so have minimal polynomial of Frobenius $T^2-p$. If you permit an abelian surface, not just a Jacobian, then the product of this elliptic curve with itself will have the desired minimal polynomial of Frobenius. For genus $2$ hyperelliptic curves a supersingular hyperelliptic curve is one whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of $2$ supersingular elliptic curves, and they are known to exist. See Choie, Jeong and Lee "Supersingular Hyperelliptic Curves of Genus 2 over Finite Fields". 

I'm going to take a more algebraic number theoretic approach to this question. The solutions to $x^2-dy^2=k$ are the integers of norm $k$ in the number field $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt(d)]$ if $d$ is a fundamental discriminant. Such integers are acted on by the unit group. To have a unique solution one must mod out by this action, but Landau singles out a unique representative instead. Those strange numbers $w$ are just the number of torsion units in various quadratic fields. 

Let's write down equations. $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ is $E$, and $dy^2=x^3+ax+b$ is $E^{F}$. Now we know that two torsion points have zero $y$ coordinate, and so the identity map is an isomorphism of $E[2]$ with $E^{F}[2]$. 

So the first thing is that your definition of $M_{n}(t)$ needs to be $\frac{1}{n}\sum e^{tX_i}$. Now Glivenko-Cantelli tells us that $F_n$ converges uniformly to $F$. Fix $A$. Now integration by parts for the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral gives us that $$\int_{-A}^{A} e^{tx}d(F_n(x)-F(x))=e^{tA}(F_n(A)-F(A))-e^{-tA}(F_n(-A)-F(-A))-t\cdot\int_{-A}^{A} (F_n(x)-F(x))e^{tx}dx$$. (The layout isn't the greatest: there is a $t$ before that last integral). Uniform convergence lets us make all these contributions negligible, as $t$ is bounded on some interval. Now we have the parts outside of $A$ to deal with. My guess is that this is where Dini's theorem comes in, letting us set $A$ big enough so the convergence is monotone (I'm not sure if that is true yet). But we can't use the integration by parts trick there, so have to be cruder. 

As part of my thesis work I have proved Ibukiyama's conjecture implies something about $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ forms associated to certain lattices lifting to $\mathrm{GSp}(4)$ (This was originally a discovery/conjecture Jeffery Hein, Gonzalo Tornaria and I made together) Now the computers of the Berkeley math department have made big lists of (some) paramodular forms in $S_3(K(p))$ for $p<1000$, each one with hopefully 100 Hecke eigenvalues computed (for small $p$ a lot more Hecke eigenvalues, for big $p$ fewer as the calculation gets hard and there are CPU limits in play). There also are some oddball forms I get when I try to go to squarefree level in general which I don't quite know where they live, but some of them correspond to hypergeometric motives (something David P. Roberts helped me discover) What conjectures should/can I test? Any particularly interesting examples you wish you knew more Hecke eigenvalues for? I already know about Harder's conjecture and plan on examining that. And yes, this will go to the LMFDB someday. Sadly I can't get the coefficients of the forms, only Hecke eigenvalues. Weight 3 is where everything has been computed so far, but that definitely can be extended. Currently I'm working on nonsquarefree levels in order to find more corresponding hypergeometric motives as they tend to have very nonsquarefree conductors. 

In Barry Mazur's paper introducing Galois deformations, he hints at having a general theory for representations which are not residually Schur, but with more complicated statements. Does anyone know where/if this got written up with a similar level of detail as in Mazur's paper? I'm particularly interested in applications to Faltings-Serre. 

Consider $\mathrm{SO}(5)$, or maybe $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ over your favorite locally compact non-Archimedian field of characteristic $0$. There are two interesting families of compact open subgroups. The first is those coming from the Moy-Prasad filtration. The second are the stabilizers of lattices. My question is as follows: is it the case that a lattice stabilizer is a subgroup of an arbitrary step in the Moy-Prasad filtration? I know the top of the Moy-Prasad filtration is a maximial parahoric, which is known (by Gan-Yu) to be a subgroup of the stabilizer of a lattice. But I don't know much more than that. 

$\bar{\rho}$ irreducible Galois rep has finitely many lifts $\rho$ unramified outside of $S$. Proof: $(\rho_2^{-1}\rho_1\rho_2-\rho_1)/\mathcal{l}^r$ is a cocycle. 

I have a matrix with integral entries $A$ and integer vector $b$, and want to determine if there is exactly one vector $x$ such that $Ax=b$. $A$ is rectangular, and I know there always is a solution. Now, Sage has a wonderful function to calculate this: solve_right. But when the input matrix and vector have dimensions around $1600$ this function eats up a lot of time and memory: 5 gigabytes and a lot of time before I finally killed it. Using the real field doesn't work either because Sage only solves linear equations with square matrices over the real field. Are there any approaches to the above problem? Perhaps I can figure out some bounds on coefficients that would let me work over a large finite field. 

See the preprint $URL$ I have just implemented this a month ago, and would be happy to share the code. 

The $x$ coordinates of the $l$-torsion points are the roots of the $l$ division polynomial. Any cyclic subgroup of order $l$ is generated by a single point of order $l$. In practice only $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ rational points are used. See for instance $URL$ 

Let $S_2^{+}(p)$ be the space of newforms of level $p$ that have Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue +1, and $S_2^{-}(p)$ be the space that have Atkin-Lehner eigenvalue $-1$. What is known about the asymptotics of $S_2^{+}(p)/S_2(p)$ and $S^{-}(p)/S_2(p)$ as $p$ goes to infinity? I did a computation involving the mass formula that gave me a surprising answer to this question, but since it involves the mass formula I am not sure I did it correctly. 

Suppose you have $G$ a finite group of Lie type (say $\mathrm{Sp}_4( \mathbb{F}_5)$ as a case I particularly care about, but there are others.) Your friend picks a subgroup $H$ and selects random matrices from it, takes their characteristic polynomials, and hands them to you. Is there a criterion that will let you figure out if $H=G$? Existing theorems I've found use the existence of transvections, which can't (as far as I can tell) be deduced from the above. Or they work over a field of characteristic $0$, where we have more Galois groups to work with. Some also work over the algebraic closure, which is a weaker hypothesis and I'm hoping it strengthens this result. This has applications to large image theorems and experimental mathematics. 

Let $D$ be a definite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$ ramified at $p$ and $\infty$ for simplicity. Then an automorphic form on $D^{x}/F^{x}$ has several different interpretations. First, through the conjugation action of $D^{x}$ on totally imaginary quaternions, this group is isomorphic to $O(3)$ split away from $p$ and $\infty$. Secondly, through the theory of the class group, a level $\mathfrak{R}$ modular form is associated to a function on the genus of an Eichler order of level $\mathfrak{R}$. Finally, Jacquet-Langlands tells us it is an ordinary modular form, via the trace formula. Now using the theta series for the Eichler order, we can compute what turns out to be a classical modular form. Does this modular form agree with the one Jacquet-Langlands would give us? It seems to me the answer is yes by strong multiplicity one. Furthermore, if we take the form on $O(3)$, we can take its theta series to get a weight $3/2$ modular form, and apply the Shimura correspondence to get a weight $2$ modular form. (Although Jacquet-Langlands is used in the proof by Waldspurger of this fact, and we do have a nontrivial kernel for some of these maps). Is this the same as the one given by theta series on the Eichler order? I think the answer is no, because many sources say so, but I've not found or constructed a good example yet. 

I'm looking at the map $w_H$ defined by Kottwitz in "Isocrystals with additional structure II" in section 7. It is a surjective group homomorphism defined for all reductive groups $H$ from $H$ to $X^{*}(Z(\hat{H})^{I})$ where $I$ is a Galois group and $\hat{G}$ denotes the dual of $G$. To define this for arbitrary reductive groups and not merely ones with $H_{sc}$ simply connected Kottwitz introduces a $z$-extension $H'$ of $H$ and a vertical arrow from $X^{*}(Z(\hat{H'})^{I})$ to $X^{*}(Z(\hat{H})^{I})$. But he doesn't define the map this arrow represents, and the only natural thing I can think of goes the other way. 

There are several different kinds of factoring and not all depend on smoothness in the same way. The first method historically was Fermat factoring: Search for solutions to $x^2-y^2=N$ by squaring numbers around $\sqrt{N}$. Continued fraction factorization methods do similar things as the quadratic sieve, but without the factor base as in [1]. Jacobian based methods (elliptic and hyperelliptic curves) search for a group of smooth order, but the runtime depends on the size of the sought-after factor, and smoothness is detected by a group calculation rather than trial factoring of sieving. [1]$URL$ 

There is sage code in John Cremona's answer to the question How to find all integer points on an elliptic curve? that is worth a try in your case. Magma also has a function for this as documented in $URL$ Try both and see. 

Yes. Let $f(x)$ be a function on $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that its Fourier transform has compact support inside of $[-R, R]$. Then $f(x)$ is completely determined by its values on $\frac{2\pi}{R}\mathbb{Z}$ by the Nyquist sampling theorem. (I may be off by a factor of two here). Thus it is completely determined by a countable number of Fourier coefficients. As the spacing between the samples decreases functions with higher frequencies can be exactly represented. As a limit of Hilbert spaces I think this only works for functions with rapidly decreasing Fourier transforms, but I haven't sat down to work through all the details. 

Birch has a conjecture about which automorphic forms on $PGL(2)$ are the lifts from nonsplit $O(3)$. Temporarily ignore global issues, and focus on the local nonarchimedian picture. The automorphic representations of $PGL(2)$ are representations of $GL(2)$ with trivial central character, and Jacquet-Langlands describes the ones that come from representations of $D^{\times}$ where $D$ is a definite quaternion algebra. (Supposedly: I've not found where in the book that result is) Then using the fact that $D^{\times}$ is a double cover of the nonsplit $SO(3)$, we should be able to prove Birch's conjecture. However, this requires a description of the representations of $D^{\times}$ that includes the central characters as a representation of $D^{\times}$. Does this appear somewhere in Jacquet-Langlands, or do people have some other source? Or is this line of reasoning insufficient to get Birch's conjecture? In the case of squarefree levels we can avoid supercuspidals, so a description that only works for the principal series and the Steinberg (and twists of Steinberg) suffices. 

Let $H$ be a finite $2$-group. Let $N_{4}(H)$ be the subgroup generated by fourth powers. Let $H_{4}$ be the last term in the short exact sequence $1\rightarrow N_4(H) \rightarrow H \rightarrow H_{4} \rightarrow 1$. Suppose that every element of $H_{4}$ has a lift to an element of order $4$, $2$ or $1$ in $H$. Is it then true that $N_4(H)=1$? When $4$ is replaced by $2$ this is true, and used in Livne's generalization of Faltings-Serre. 

Variety has a number of slightly different definitions. Apparently some authors use reduced of finite type over a field, whereas I would want separated to rule out the line with two origins. Most people use scheme-theoretic language to solve this problem. Conway-Sloane jokes the discriminant of a quadratic form is a function of the form and the author. They are not wrong. That same subject has two distinct definitions of integral, which are basically the same (multiply by $2$) but which are a pain to keep track of. The Hasse-Witt invariant has two different definitions as well. 

Suppose I have a motive $M$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and can compute the Euler factor of the associated $L$-function for any good prime $p$. How can I compute the Zariski closure of the image of the Galois group? In particular I am interested in the case where $M$ is a hypergeometric motive as implemented in Magma. I only have access to the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius operator for any prime $p$, so ideally any characterization would need only this information. Sato-Tate data indicates it is $\mathrm{USp}(4)$. 

In order to use the known cases of Langlands the starting point is Serre's conjecture, now a theorem of Khare and Wintenberger. Serre's conjecture states that any odd, continuous, absolutely irreducible, dimension two over a finite field, representation of $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ is modular. So in your problem we need to find a field and a representation of dimension two of $S_5$. Unfortunately there is an obvious projective representation, but no obvious representation. Results of Tate that were cited by Bosman in his PhD thesis provide conditions under which lifting is possible, namely that we can take unramified liftings at all but finitely many primes. However, it isn't clear to me what that lifting would look like in this case. Once we find the representation (ideally with some explicit formula) we have to ask what sort of automorphic object appears on the other side. In this case it will be a modular form, which we know how to write down and calculate, once you know the weight, level, and enough coefficients to give it uniquely. 

Yes it is! We have Gröbner basis algorithms that can answer the question of ideal membership and can be used to answer many other geometric questions. If you are interested in this further, Cox, Little O'Shea have a good introduction to algebraic geometry from this perspective. 

Suppose we have $M$ a hypergeometric motive, and $\rho$ its associated Galois rep over $\mathbb{Q}_{l}$. Is there any easy/concrete way to find $\bar{\rho}$, the residual representation at a prime (in this case 2)? If we were discussing the Galois representation associated to an abelian variety, we would look for the $2$-torsion, but I'm not aware of an equivalent formulation here. Furthermore the primes of ramification are too large for complete tables of number fields, so we cannot use that method. 

If $G$ is a semisimple algebraic group over a local field with finite residue field $K$ and $x$ a point in the Bruhat-Tits building $B(G, K)$ then the parahoric group scheme $P_x$ is a group scheme $P$ whose $O_K$ points are the connected component of the stabilizer of $x$. If $G$ is not semisimple there is a construction of a group scheme $P$ associated to $x$ called a parahoric. But as the center of $G$ acts trivially on the building the $O_K$ points of $P$ aren't exactly the stabilizer of $x$. Is it the case that $Z(G(K))P_{x}(O_K)$ is the connected component of the stabilizer of $x$? This seems believable from the construction. If $x$ is in the extended compartment instead will I just get the connected component of $P_{x}(O_K)$? Bruhat and Tits don't use the extended compartment, so I lack good references for that.
