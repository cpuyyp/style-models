So, in this case did the author of the book you are reading translate the date to "new style" or is it an "old style" (Julian) date? You make your best guess (Julian?) and footnote the source. Sometimes you will see ("o.s.") in books, indicating that they are using an old style date. 

None of the contemporary accounts I have read, such as that of Francis L. Hawks (1861), which is more or less the official account of the missions, make any mention of an attack of any kind. In the Hawks narrative the embassy is presented as entirely peaceful. Also, the text of the letter which Millard Fillmore gave to Perry for delivery to the Emperor specifically says that he had ordered Perry not to do anything "which would disturb the peace of Japan". There is a book written by an eye witness, John Smith Sewall. "The Logbook of the Captain's Clerk" published in 1905. Sewall was the clerk to the Captain of one of the escorts of the expedition. Nowhere in this book does he mention any shots or "blanks" fired and he represents the embassy as peaceful except for three shells fired by the Japanese which exploded harmlessly behind them when they first arrived. These shots by the Japanese are also mentioned in the Hawks narrative. 

The Mesoamerican Ballgame was played in more-ancient times than the Grecian games (1600 BCE) - but there is not a strong opinion about whether it was played as an inter-nation event in such ancient times. Certainly, for the Aztecs, the ballgame had a ritual significance, also we know that their conduct of ritual was a political stage that hierarchically organized tributes. Those tributes often involved people, that were ultimately used for human sacrifice – and such sacrifice did sometimes occur after these sporting events. 

If I were in your shoes, I would pay for this even if your relatives cannot. I would travel to be with them for the start of this process, and when the conservationist arrives - so that my relatives understood that I share their values regarding this documentation of birthright. Advice I glean that you do not have much affection for the noble system nor the meaning of your family's title. I encourage you not to push on your relatives regarding matters that I have outlined are against their values, as this will only distance you from them and limit the positive impact that you can have on the preservation of this relic. Apologize to them for any insult, and affirm that you will help them with proper preservation, within their household, under them control. Convey to them how lack of a consultant conservationist could risk the condition of this document. It has survived 500 years — ensure that it can survive no less than 500 more. 

The Wikipedia page on the British Official History of the Great War. A lot of the volumes are available as PDFs in various web archives. For example, this map, in the chapter on First Contact with the Enemy is extracted from a volume freely available: 

Obviously you could theorize about such things all day long. Thankfully, user2590 above stopped after one page. To answer this question in one paragraph, let me paraphrase what a wise old man once told me: "At the end of the day, people only care about one thing: results." When Robespierre took control, he promised what everybody wanted, which was to solve the food problem. He attempted to do this by creating price controls, then, when that did not work, by sending soldiers out into the provinces to try to seize grain by force from farmers. When these methods failed to improve the food problem, his time was up. If Robespierre had succeeded in delivering copious quantities of cheap food to the masses of Paris, he might have had a long career ahead of him. That did not happen. 

Not all sacrifices were human, and other events called for blood (cutting) or animal sacrifice. Such non-human-death sacrifices were often evoked by personal omen-istic experiences like 

The ritual calendar(s) are quite detailed, with minor differences between cultures. The Maya were no special case in the following list, because the ritual calendar was more-or-less driven by the imperialism of the Aztec empire. Simply, the 'corners of the year' (solstices and equinoxes) were the major ritual times because the sacrifices governed the prosperous / abundant transition of the seasons. Omens were another large governor of sacrifices: 

Matters of language are probably best handled elsewhere, so I'll try to answer the question that I think is answer-able here: 

Great answers have been given regarding the general lack of warfare between Mesoamerican peoples, and North American peoples. 

It is right to understand that this book is a book of title. Internal Affairs First, your assertions that this belongs in a museum are very-evidently part of your friction with those relatives regarding documentation or movement of the book. Many families treat these relics with intense protection, and would consider any outside personnel purely as consultants in the preservation of their family's relics. To such a mindset, transferring such document to another person, even as a service, is maybe what we can call a 'secular form of sacrilege'. If you are uncomfortable with that or cannot grok it, you will not be able to ally with you relatives in any significant way on this matter. In some societies, noble title grants a birthright to land, political interaction, or other affairs. I do know know Spain's noble system well enough to say more. For people that value their family's history with this kind of 'hallowed' conscience, the suggestion that such a relic be appraised for monetary value is just plain insulting. One could ask the question "You would peddle your birthright for a meal?" Preservation I cannot say yes/no if relinquishing this documentation of title to a museum would forfeit your family's title within the royal system of Spain. Preservation of this relic is absolutely critical. If you family has no money to preserve the document, and they have no care for their noble rights, then turning the document over to a museum is a [small] gift to the nation of Spain, as it preserves the history. Preserving History is, itself, an 'act of noble stature'. But preserving the document within the family is the more respectable thing to do. You are correct that a preservationist should come in to inspect the relic and evaluate: 

On paper the USSR had some of the strictest environmental laws in the world, however, in most cases they were just paper laws and were widely ignored. Ironically, the USSR did very detailed studies on environment contaminants such as mercury. In some cases the EPA actually used Soviet reports on mercury and other toxic chemicals as a data source because the Soviet studies were so detailed. In general, the Soviet Union had a lackluster record on the environment. One typical example of this was the sulfur dioxide problem. Behind the iron curtain making monumental statues of Lenin, Stalin, etc, out of cheap materials was popular, so in many cases these statues were heavily affected by acid rain. The Soviet response was to hide the affected statues. In 1988, the United States, USSR and Japan all voted against a UN proposal to hold carbon dioxide emissions at 1988 levels through the year 2000. In 1989, at the Malta Summit, Bush brought up the upcoming formation of the IPCC and associated conference on "climate change" with Gorbachev. Environmental advocates hailed this as "progress". Generally speaking, the global warming initiative did not catch on until the 1990s when the Soviet Union had already collapsed. Years later, Gorbachev became, like Gore, a strong proponent of global warming activism. However, there was no significant interest in the global warming topic during his tenure as the President of the Soviet Union. 

There are other examples of inter-nation games in the Native American nations, though not as ancient as the Grecian games. Also, I have heard pro and con arguments on the idea that these sporting events were used to solve disputes and other 'inter-national' planning without deadly warfare. One example of such an inter-nation game is Pasuckuakohowog. It was like football, and involved thousands of players (e.g. many nations). Other games, like Chunkey, were played as far back as the 600's CE. 

Carbohydrates were the basis for nutrition stores (silos), which were not possible with meats and fruits/vegetables due to availability. Such storage allows longer forays (time spent doing an activity rather than gathering/preparing food); which probably enabled more scouting/exploration, conquest, design / 'science'. People today do not need to eat so much grain / carbs. Our nutrition only expanded since agriculture. So we cannot say that we had better nutrition back then. I suppose you could try to argue that, per capita, nutrition was better. This argument would require proving that fewer meats, fruits and vegetables exist per-capita today than in pre-agricultural times. If you cannot show that, then the situation is purely that we have more options for nutrition today (and possibly worse choices) 

Recently I was reading Brugsch's History of Egypt and he describes the figure of Horus as being that of a "sparrowhawk". Now, I have the greatest respect for Brugsch and consider him the best Egyptologist by a margin, but anyone who knows anything about birds, can tell Horus is not a sparrowhawk. I am no serious bird watcher, but even I can tell the difference between a sparrowhawk and a falcon. The question, however, is what kind of falcon is he? There would seem to be two candidates: the Barbary Falcon and the Lanner Falcon, both of which are commonly found in Egypt. I have three theories: (1) The two types of falcon (Barbary and Lanner) are quite similar to each other, so Horus is considered to be indifferently either one of them and the Egyptians drew no special distinction between the two species. (2) Horus is a Barbary Falcon because that type of falcon tends to have stronger, more distinctive facial markings and a rounder head, both characteristics of the stereotype of Horus. (3) Horus is a Lanner Falcon, and specifically a female because the female Lanner Falcon is very large and majestic compared to all other types of falcons and hunts in a majestic way, descending from tall cliffs. Would there be a reason for preferring one of these theories (or some other)? 

Because of the complex inter-linking of planetary calendar phases (sun, moon, venus, mars, saturn, mercury), certain calendrical intersections were times for sacrifices. Places where the count reset itself (such as the 2012 long-count incrementation) were also times for awareness. Since many of these intersections are dictated by solar cycles, the seasons sacrifices would have had special meaning at these epagomenal times. 

I wrote a paper related this topic, for peer review. Basically, the general story (maybe "propaganda") of state ritual sacrifice was that those sacrificed were becoming god-like, and so were elevated to the holiest status achievable - perhaps (in a distant way) like suicide bombers today. The Aztecs saw that representing yourself as one of these Divine Powers was a 'holy' thing - but only those representing the 'big 4' divinities had the national stage, and even then the selection process was something of a random lot. No one charged toward it. Being chosen for one of the lesser Divine Powers was probably even less attractive, to the individual. Whether this was a way to 'clear out undesirables' is not yet clear. Certainly, it is known that these people (ixiptla) were drugged. The way that songs were written, and evolved over time, about these ixiptla, we can infer that people took this practices as vital, if not serious, part of the cycle of life. In my paper, I present evidence that the upper classes saw the sacrificial practice as a way to glean necessary insights about the future of the civilization. A mix of augury and science. 

The quote comes from the Jami' al-tawarikh (the Ilkhanate's "History of the World"). The quote as given by d'Ohsson, translated from the French: 

I doubt that William could write. In the Saxon Chronicle, the coronation is listed as one of the events of "An. MLXVI." This is what it says exactly: 

During the First Opium War, on the march to Peking, many of the battles that occurred did not involve Chinese soldiers, but fighters that the British described as "Tartars," being vaguely described as either Mongolians or Turks. Who were these men and from where did they come. Were they Mongolians or Turks or both or some others? One thing to note is that the Manchu themselves have sometimes been described as "Tartars," so there is the possibility that they were actually Manchu. 

Thus you can see 1490 was really the watershed year when Henry VII basically made it clear: ok, everybody, we are all going English. 

The nose guard is kind of a strange item in some ways. They would not provide much protection against a heavy weapon like a mace. I think the main purpose was to prevent getting slashed in the face with a sword.
