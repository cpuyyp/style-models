Bogdanovist, Read this article as it will give you the best evidence based research about your question and a treatment plan. If you can have access to a PT near by, I strongly suggest you to go see one. Make sure a PT is experience with sports injuries. Real quick tips to get back on your feet fast: 

Lift weights - especially heavy weights by focusing on the major muscle groups like chest, thigh, butt, back and core. Try squats, deadlifts, benches, chin-ups, bent-over rows and lat pull-down machine next time when you are at the gym. Try to lift 2-3 days per week with at least 85%-90% of your maximal effort for 8-12 reps. And if you are worrying about spending hours in the gym or losing your high speed or the intensity (triathlon) with weight lifting, then you can always try to workout with higher intensity (perform multiple exercises as a group/cycle) with less rest in between exercises (10-20 seconds), and rest about 60 seconds at the end before moving to the next cycle. For example, try to perform squat, bench, lat pull-down as a group (supersetting) with only 10-20 seconds of rest in between exercises, then rest 60 seconds after completing the whole cycle. Repeat 3 more cycles. Consume more calories - but not just any, the right kind of calories. The way you are training right now (most triathletes do), yo will need lots of energy, if not you will continue to see your weight to drop- try to consume more of these foods from now on peanut butter, avocados, sweet potatoes, nuts and of whole eggs. If after about 4-6 weeks of trying the above advice, and you still don't see results, you might want to look into hiring a sports nutritionist who has knowledge about weight lifting or a certified strength & conditioning specialist who has knowledge about sports nutrition to give you a complete individualized - gain lean muscle mass program while still training for your triathlon. 

To maximize side to side muscle isolation To decrease compensatory movement/dominance from one side to another To be sports-specific and functional, since most sports and daily activities are single leg activities (walking, reaching, running, jumping, cutting, etc.) To improve propriocenption or balance enhancement Also, all of these reasons can later enhance injury prevention 

You will need to start performing dynamic warm-up. In addition, I strongly recommend you to perform 2 sets of 10 reps of burpee push-ups before any chest exercises from now on. You will also need to start training your core even more. Perhaps the most important routine you need to start looking into is to slowly adding eccentric strengthening exercises, particularly the pecs and the hamstrings. For your eccentric hamstring exercises, you may want to start out with the single leg stance matrix reach. After a few weeks, you can try the kneeling hamstring curl. For your pecs, you can try eccentric push-ups or going down much slower than usual, and this can be done for all chest exercises (presses). 

Strengthen your hip abductors Strengthen your posterior chain (glutes and hamstring) Stretch your Tensor Fascia Latae Either practice in front of a mirror or have someone continue to watch your form to give you feedback while performing a squat 

Workout 3 days per week with one day of rest in between. Try 4 sets of 10-20 reps. Rest 45-60 seconds between sets and between exercises Next 4 weeks 

It seems like you have already been doing most of the high intensity interval training with BJJ and Muay Thai, and that is one great way to get rid of your belly fat. However, here are some rules to remember when it comes to losing belly fat and gaining muscle mass at the same time: 

EMG studies show that pull-ups and chin-ups to not target your lats as much as bent-over rows. Half pull-ups at top or bottom has no significant difference when it comes to lats activiation. Behind the neck pull-ups hurt your shoulders because you have placed the greatest amount of stress on your biceps tendon and the rotator cuff - not good. Your arms get tired quicker than your lats when doing pull-ups because the pull-ups isolate the forearm more than the lats. Read number one answer. If you want to increase the number of pull-ups, then you should try one of these techniques: 

Geek, A couple quick thoughts about this routine: One is that this is not a beginner routine (most beginners won't be able to perform pull-ups or dips), and two is that doing max out reps for each exercise is not the best way to start out of any exercise, workout or routine. You are at a higher risk for injuries (most commonly is tendonitis and extreme muscle soreness that may last for days). I have been working with high level gymnasts and college athletes over 10 years now, and one of my specialty is to design and implement calisthenic workout routines for all athletes at all fitness levels. To answer your question specifically, I have broken down your workout routine including the frequency and duration for you. I do think that since you have been doing SS for over a year consistently, you should consider yourself as an intermediate level, not a beginner in my opinion. So here it is: Your workout for the first 2 weeks: 

Dexamethasone 0.4% or acetic acid 5% delivered via iontophoresis can be used to provide short-term (2 to 4 weeks) pain relief and improved function. Prefabricated or custom foot orthoses can be used to provide shortterm (3 months) reduction in pain and improvement in function. There appear to be no differences in the amount of pain reduction or improvement in function created by custom foot orthoses in comparison to prefabricated orthoses. There is currently no evidence to support the use of prefabricated or custom foot orthoses for longterm (1 year) pain management or function improvement. Night splints should be considered as an intervention for patients with symptoms greater than 6 months in duration. The desired length of time for wearing the night splint is 1 to 3 months. The type of night splint used (ie, posterior, anterior, sock-type) does not appear to affect the outcome. 

Seems like everyone has giving you some good advice. However, I agree with JohnP the most because your health should be the most important aspect of your life. Find something you like, get up and take breaks frequently to drink some water throughout the day is cheap and possibly would give you the most health benefits while you are at work. Since you are sitting mostly at work, you will need to do some exercises to strengthen your core, back, posture and yes even your hip extensors (buttocks). Keep in mind that getting out of your chair and doing these exercises a few times per day is best. Here are some exercises/workouts you can try while you are at work. 

From a Sports Physical Therapist standpoint, I prescribe all single leg exercises to include the single leg deadlift for a few reasons: 

Don't forget that genetics also have a role of this. Also, overweight (obesity) is perhaps one of the main causes of chronic and gradual OA of all joints, especially the knees. Here are all of the scientific evidence regarding OA: 

John, Dave Liepmann is correct. However, the concept is called Isometric hold vs. Full Range of Motion. Full Range of Motion exercises are more functional and have been shown to reduce stress on the joints. In this case, it's the shoulder the the elbow joints. Isometric hold has been shown to recruit more muscle fibers, but also increase stress on the joints (shoulders and elbows with bench press). This is because our body and joints are more suited for full range of motion with our daily activities. Think about it, we tend to get up and move, pick up things and put them down, constantly moving from one place to another. With this being said, there is nothing wrong with training with Isometric hold, just as long as you have a goal and is functional and specific to that goal. If your goal is to recruit more muscle fibers, then you should try to train with Isometric hold every now and then. I say 1-2 times per month to reduce stress on the joints (squats, bench presses, shoulder presses, etc.). It takes time to get used to this type of training methodology. A good example is to look at the way most offensive linemen train. They do train with Isometric hold (typically for about 5-10 seconds) to give their running backs and quarterbacks sometime to work with. All in all, just making sure the training methodology is suited for your goals and is functional to your activities, whether you are a runner, weight lifters or any athlete to reduce injuries and for best results. Hope this helps! 

Hamstring strengthening is very important to prevent knee injuries in addition to improve your performance, especially in sports that require lots of kicking, jumping, cutting, sprinting, acceleration and deceleration. If you can find a stability ball, then you can try these exercises: 

Corner stretch for the entire lower and upper chest and mainly the pec major This corner stretch to mainly target the pec minor, which has been shown to be more problematic in the PT world from my experience. 

a. Eccentric training - going down slowly b. Train more often - pretty much work-up to doing pull-ups everday eventually c. Supersetting - pull-ups, then perform a few reps of lat pull-down Here is a qretty good book about "pull-ups." Good luck! 

Lightbulb, Moses already mentioned about dieting, and Moses is right. I don't know much about your diet, but I can tell you that the truth about sustainable weight loss has a lot to do with proper eating and little to do with exercising. This works for all normal individuals (no hormonal imbalances). With this being said, I don't think you should worry about whether you should lift weights or doing cardio to lose weight. The truth is that if you decide to lift weights, and you burn more calories then you consume, and if you continue to do so, then you will lose weight. You may even get more toned and more muscle definition. Look at the women gymnasts and cheerleaders. They use their own bodyweight as resistance. On the other end, if you run 2 hours per day, but you consume more calories than you burn, then you will gain weight. This is true with many people in the gym on the treadmills and the ellipticals. It's really all about calories in and calories out. It sounds like you are working out at a moderate intensity (sweat a lot), so I won't change much. Just make sure your diet is good and clean. Here is what I always tell my patients and clients! Tips and tricks for successful and sustainable weight loss: Eat healthier foods throughout the day to include meals and snacks. Try to eat every 2-3 hours (including snacks) to keep your metabolism running high, thus resulting in burning more calories. Consume the least amount of sugar as possible. Foods like milk, juices, sodas and sweet snacks have lots of sugar, which will slow down your metabolism, thus will not be effective for burning calories. Be sure to read the label before purchasing or consuming. Drink plenty of water so that you will feel full throughout the day (12-16 glasses per day). If you do eat late (after 7 PM), try to eat good calories like vegetables and lean proteins. If not, make sure to exercise extra to burn those calories the same night. Yes! Exercise, but try resistance training. You do not have to use actual weights, but rather mostly your body weight to get results (look at the gymnasts). Plus, resistance training has been shown to boost your metabolism. Remember the more muscle you have, the more calories you will burn throughout the day. If you start a habit by eating healthier, most likely you will sustain the results because it is so natural to eat, and not so natural to exercise and sweat. I hope this has been helpful! 

That's common sense, and that's also science. With that being said, currently there is no scientific evidence regarding temperature and weight loss in a significant number. So, the answer is no, especially going from 75 degrees to 68 degrees. By the way, if you continue to consume more food than you can burn, then I don't think the temperature has much to do with weight loss! Thoughts? 

If you train harder, you will need more complex carbs. If you train longer, you will need more complex carbs. If you train more frequently, you will need more complex carbs. If you want to gain muscle with weight lifting, yes you will need both proteins and complex carbs (energy). Try reading this plan from Greatist. But don't forget that if you can't answer the 4 questions that I posted above, then it's going to be tough to assist you regarding your dieting plan. 

As for as muscle recruitment goes, read this article. Basically, stiff-legged deadlift has been shown to recruit more hamstrings, glutes and paraspinal muscles. There are risks for all exercises; however, with proper form and technique, the single leg deadlift is safe and effective for the above reasons. Hope this helps! 

Skiing is what I would call a relatively eccentric loading your quads and glutes. This is where your muscles are constantly working in an lengthening phase, relatively in a squatting position. So, you need to train specifically to this phase. My recommendation is for you to look into the slide board equipment. There are many versions for the slide boards. I would strongly recommend for you to look into this piece of equipment. Here are some exercises that you can do in the mean time to get your quads stronger with just body weight. 

Freakyuser, It might not be your hamstring muscle. If you can touch the floor with your knuckles without bending the knees, then it is most likely not your hamstring. Also, this is beyond average (most people can't do this). You might want to check and see if your lumbar spine is the problem of your stiffness. However, you can read the Functional Movement Screen and see if you can test your own hamstring flexibility. You can watch this video on the active straight leg raise and see it for yourself. When you said, "I feel a stone-hard hamstring." First of all, this is pretty normal because that's when you start to put your sciatic nerve on a stretch, so your neuromuscular response is to stop your muscle from going any further. This is done to prevent injury. However, you might want to stretch your piriformis muscle, since the sciatic nerve runs straight throught it. Give your piriformis muscle a stretch and see. So the answer is that it is pretty normal for you to feel this way at that stretch point. However, you might want to start working on your lumbar spine mobility and stretch your piriformis. Check out the lumbar spine mobility exercises and see if you can start working on your lumbar spine mobility. You can also try dynamic stretching since it's been proving to be more effective overall. Good luck! 

Make sure you do not have any shoulder instability problems before doing these stretches as they may cause some pain. You should feel the stretches in the muscles, not in the shoulder joints. Try not to lean forward to far in the beginning to reduce stress on the shoulder joints. I recommend holding the stretches for about 20-30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times and perform them at least 2-3 times per day for best results. In addition to these stretches, you can try this one on a foam roller for 5 minutes before bed for an awesome stretch of the entire chest, shoulders and biceps. 

First of all, you might want to read this article, "Pull-up or Chin-up" by Mike Reinold to get a better understanding regarding chin-ups and pull-ups in general. The truth is that chin-ups and pull-ups both target your lats somewhat equally (no significant difference according to EMG studies); however, as you know already that chin-ups will isolate the biceps a little more, according to EMG studies. So, if you really want to target your biceps more without losing the lat isolation, then yes you should stick with chin-ups from now on. Regarding the body weight rows (sometimes referred to as inverted rows), this is just another variation (easier) for the chin-ups or the pull-ups. With that being said, you can continue with the underhand gripped inverted row in addition to adding a few sets of eccentric chin-ups towards the end of your workout. I say you should try 3 sets of max of the eccentric chin-ups before you call it a day. Don't be surprised if your biceps are extremely sore the next few days. This is due to the fact that eccentric strengthening has been shown to damage more muscle fibers, but no worries, with proper rest and nutrition along with good sleep, your biceps will grow bigger. Good luck! Hope this helps!
