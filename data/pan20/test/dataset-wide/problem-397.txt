This is something of a question mark for me when it comes to world building, since a cursory examination of our own history shows many of our most important advances have been spurred by the desire to gain the upper hand in conflict. Setting aside explanations of alien mentality (ie. 'they just don't think like humans') and formerly more warlike civilisations achieving technological mastery before adopting a pacifist mindset, what conditions could realistically spur the development of a civilisation like this? I'm looking for primarily environmental and sociological influences, though I'm not averse to external influences. 

The most useful direction to take is to look at proto-currency. Something portable enough to carry around, yet useful enough that a community can use it without necessarily having a trader come by for a long time. Lumps of metal would be most useful for this. Little bits of workable iron or tin, weighed and shaped into ad-hoc coinage and valuable to any community for a wide variety of uses. Iron is useful because you can shape it into nails, tools, weapons, anything you need. Tin similarly because it can be mixed with copper to make similarly useful bronze, or used to patch holes in cookware, make utensils, and so on. Both are broadly useful for different reasons and a traveller could be fairly sure that they could get a meal and a bunk in exchange for a few lumps of tin or iron. Someone can always find a use for a little extra tin or iron at hand, after all. If electricity is available to your societies, copper will itself become a potentially useful currency - the stuff is expensive to use even today: one of the advantages of fibre is even that it doesn't need so much copper! And they're going to need a relatively steady stream of the stuff to replace old, worn out cables and extend the network and build generators and all kinds of things so there's never going to be enough. In future someone may begin minting coins of guaranteed weight this way and continue progress along the historic development of currency, but for your world proto-currency seems more than sufficient. 

You've got the right of your phoenixes off the battlefield - they're strategically quite powerful, able to torch supply lines, spy from the air, and more. On the battlefield, though, they get to fill a role that's historically very glamorous. Specifically, they make truly superb heavy cavalry. Or, thanks to their size, a whole brigade of knights. Like heavy cavalry, they can completely devastate a unit of soldiers. They'd swoop instead of charge, of course, but they could boil an entire unit alive in their armour. However, like heavy cavalry they're also vulnerable to prepared infantry- a thicket of pikes will sting for sure. Unlike heavy cavalry, they're very manoeuvrable (since they can of course fly). They never have to engage if they don't want to. They may or may not be more vulnerable to archers - they obviously can't wear armour and the heat will only do so much to burn away arrows. They're also not themselves vulnerable to heavy cavalry- indeed, a brigade of knights caught in the open is easy prey for even a single phoenix. A phoenix can also influence a battle more indirectly with fire - lighting fires upwind of the enemy will limit their options drastically in the right conditions. This then gives us their glamorous battlefield role (when present). When on the field, a phoenix can: 

Those who make this discovery will quickly come to a grim realisation: the dragons used to dream, too. And one day, we too could go the way of the dragons. And with that realisation would come an urgent imperative to not irresponsibly use such a power, lest you accidentally destroy yourself and everyone with you when the universe tilts just enough that there's no place for humans anymore. You would be looking at a kind of religion, either its own or added to the existing major religions. Its central tenet? To believe in the world as it is. To assert the world is as it is, to reinforce the existence of those they love and care about. "I believe I am. I believe in my family who loves me. I believe in my neighbours beside me, I believe in their little house with the red roof, I believe in the sparrows in their front yard..." It wouldn't stop demagoguery outright, but in everyone reinforcing their beliefs in the things they know and care for, the impact of a demagogue is less likely to change the world into something unrecognisable. Peter Pan would gain a whole new significance. 

Here's where you get a knowledge gap problem - when you don't know enough about a topic it's hard to see how much you don't know. For example, why exactly do we twist copper cables together? Why is it important for an antenna to have the precise dimensions it does? Why do we build long distance fibre optic cables from two different kinds of cable and switch periodically? How can we modulate a transmission to limit the interference on a receiver from an open-air optical signal arriving multiple times due to reflection effects? That last one might get you a PhD if you can prove your answer works. As you learn more about a topic you learn to ask questions you wouldn't have even realised existed with a lower level of knowledge. So too for the Erubians. To us their replicators are pure magic, the stuff of gods. To them, well, they'd sure as heck love to find a design for a stray quark regulator that doesn't have a resonance in the 300THz band that wastes so many extra materials... 

The economy would boom! Without the need to deal with ordinary malaises all sectors would abruptly be able to reduce spending on day to day healthcare. No more losses to sick days, no more expensive medicine for chronic conditions! No more cancer to take our loved ones too soon! That said there's still always going to be call for doctors, they just get to palm off the simple stuff to nanobots. You're going to get a dip in the transitional period but it's a truism that there's never enough doctors today so the drop probably won't be too high. Certainly there will be shifts. Some sectors of healthcare will shrink, like insurance, but 20 years is a decent chunk of a career; plenty of time to readjust to the exciting new world. Maybe some retire early, proud to see the impossible day they were finally able to say the job was done. But there will always be work to be done. You can't genetically engineer away a car crash, or a table saw. You can't engineer away a terrible industrial accident. Efforts will shift towards emergency care, to saving that many more victims who now get to live because the paramedics don't have to worry about as many of the victims. The new dream in research is now true immortality, to solve that last year of life and turn it into an eternity. Turn the last year into two years. Cure the disease that crops up at 200. Invent a nanobot that saves someone five minutes dead. Ten minutes. A day. Brain backups. Meet your great great great grandkids. Wouldn't you pay for that? The important bit here is that medicine as a discipline doesn't really shrink so much as find loftier mountains to climb. In the past some attrition in the family was ordinary, today we don't accept children dying at all. In the future with all these advances we'll just raise our standards - if you can shrug off a car crash we'll work on how to save you from a run in with an exploding fuel tanker. 

The Threat Model Let's start by modelling our problem. The scenario you've posited of a self driving car being used as a bomb, as has been mentioned, is quite similar to an ordinary kamikaze car bomb attack. Compared to a kamikaze car bomb attack, the smart-car bomb attack benefits from not requiring the death of its 'pilot'. However, it's also limited by the fact that a smart-car will drive to an appropriate parking space safely, and at a safe speed. We can expect that this system would be difficult to override; a drunk/reckless driver attempting to override the self-driving controls and smashing into a storefront would pretty clearly be part of ordinary safety concerns. Thus, we can say that a would-be terrorist would have a hard time configuring a smart-car to, say, ram a building's entrance. They would have to settle for a parking space or remotely triggering somewhere along the route to a parking space. Along the lines of the parked-car constraint, another threat scenario we can point to in the real world is that of a more conventional car bomb. There's plenty of examples of this kind of attack before the era of suicide bombings - the IRA, the first World Trade Centre attack, the list goes on. In this case, the attacker drives the weapon into some ordinary parking area then leaves the scene. Later, the bomb explodes (to some varying effect). Like a smart-car attack, an ordinary car bomb doesn't directly expose the attacker, and is constrained to ordinary travel routes. Unlike a smart-car attack, the attacker does not necessarily have to enter the vicinity of the attack, and the weapon could be triggered automatically (eg. when the car recognises that it has successfully parked) - removing any opportunity to identify the car as suspicious before it explodes. Combining these two factors, we can model this problem in known terms: An attacker blackmails a car-owner (henceforth, the driver) into visiting a target location. Unbeknownst to the driver, the attacker has previously loaded the car with remote-controlled explosives and hidden cameras, which the attacker monitors from a hidden location. At an opportune moment, the attacker detonates the explosives. Based on this threat model, we can come up with a few lines of defence that should effectively mitigate this type of attack: Spot the Explosives It's no mistake that in the developed world we haven't seen any suicide bombing attacks for quite some time. Even in countries like Indonesia (that aren't generally in the view of the western world), the only suicide attack had very limited impact and was effectively halted by the police. In fact, the main impact was some young ladies developing a crush on a particularly dashing looking young officer. Security agencies around the world are extremely cognisant of the risk of explosives, and monitor anything that could potentially be used for explosives production closely, from fertiliser to civil explosives. So the first line of defence is to spot the attacker before they're ready to attack. If they can't get explosives, then what they have is a car. A car that will safely park itself in front of a government building and achieve a parking fine. Meanwhile they can be arrested or tapped for information or even subjected to a sting operation. It's unlikely, but possible that someone slips through the gaps - but this defence will likely make any explosives that do get through a lot weaker. Halt the Car The car would likely have either an unwilling driver or no driver at all in this threat model. (The attacker sacrificing themselves we'll call out of scope, since at that point it's an ordinary suicide attack). Either would render a smart-car suspicious to passers-by and likely prompt police intervention. Since a smart-car is self-driving, it's trivial to include electronics to make it smart-stopping. Using such remote lockout features would allow a smart car bomb detected in the process of driving to its destination to be easily halted at a safe distance and any victims rescued. In the worst case, the bomb gets triggered early, to reduced effect compared to the intended target. This defence line is less effective in the case of an ordinarily-driverless car, like an automated delivery van. Protect Vulnerable Areas Not all targets are high value, and not all high value targets are vulnerable to this attack. We can expect that our attackers would be aiming to target places where lots of people congregate, to maximise damage. However, we can also rule out some places; for example, a major sports stadium is unlikely to be vulnerable because a car would have a great deal of difficulty getting into, say, the stands. Most vulnerable are street-facing entrances, and street malls, where cars generally share space with a great many people. To mitigate this, we need to keep cars from sharing space with people - remove parking spaces directly in front of high traffic buildings, and build walking-only street malls (for example, Bourke Street Mall in Melbourne is completely elevated and with bollards, only certain vehicles like trams and armoured cars are allowed and only specially.) Build important buildings with spacious parks and plazas out the front. As a bonus, this can be justified as tying into building more enjoyable public spaces, transforming a potential 'fear factor' into a 'liveable city factor'. For example, the State Library of Victoria with its lawns and steps and greek columns is basically immune to an attack like this, and it's by no means a product of a risk mitigation strategy. Hunt Down the Culprit Bombs are... not easy. For one, they explode. And there's only so many people with the skills to become the Unabomber out there, and most of them are quite sane (and employed by the military.) Attackers capable of sophisticated bombing attacks are quite rare. In any case after each individual threat is gone, there'll be plenty of evidence like phone records and witness testimony that will allow the police to hunt down the true culprit over the course of the coming months. Over the course of a few arrests and deaths, the threat of explosives will rapidly decline as the best-and-brightest of attackers get exposed and removed from the equation. Conclusion Between these four factors, the risk of a serious attack can be quite efficiently mitigated (without panicking the electorate!) It's extremely unlikely an attacker gets a hold of explosives, but if they do, they can be stopped by remotely halting the car, and even if they don't get detected, their would-be targets are naturally unsuitable for dramatic attacks like this. And afterwards we keep arresting/shooting bomb-makers so the would-be attackers run out of bomb-making experts. More likely than not, you'll end up facing a different threat altogether, once you've made the explosives attack completely infeasible (in fact, in the real world that's precisely why we're facing all these ramming-car attacks - our security agencies have basically killed the idea of sneaking around explosives stone dead.) 

This creates a tricky situation. If I run out of pad, you can't send me more messages without somehow getting me a new pad. If a message gets intercepted, you need to somehow figure that out and tell me how much I need to increment by. We can get around this by, say, discarding a page every day or numbering the pads, but this means a lot more pad and leads into the third problem: I need to hide at least twice as many documents as you're sending. To decode a letter I need the letter and its key. That's two documents I could be caught with and executed for, and two documents that might be intercepted, either of which would ruin the message. With all that said, it probably wouldn't see a great deal of use outside of very special circumstances where it's better to lose the information outright rather than risk discovery- internal affairs rather than wars. A regional governor has perverse tastes, and if discovered the province could revolt. Still the agent needs to inform their superior so it can be handled discreetly, so the one time pad is used. In crisis situations they probably wouldn't be used - if the byzantine generals are trying to coordinate, losing the critical message to a messenger being intercepted is worse than the defenders getting hold of the plan. Of note, the message loss problem can be solved if I retain used pads to decode corrupted messages and cope with messages arriving out of order, but this then becomes more of a codebook than a one time pad. For the circumstances we would want to use a one time pad (ie. where we would prefer for nobody to know the message over the proverbial Eve knowing it) it represents something of an unwelcome risk. 

You know what happens when you start answering questions like 'how holy is my neighbour?' You get witch hunts, that's what. Bad enough they're picking fights with each other, encouraging it by answering questions about how holy their rivals are is only going to make matters worse. One priest gets it into his head that because the local wise woman isn't blessed he should burn her at the stake and then the whole village is worse off. Nasty stuff. You can't stop them from going out and doing it anyway, but you can refuse to be a party to it. How much power you bestow on anyone is your business and nobody else's. Sometimes that means you can't say that the new pontiff is actually a follower of the god of duplicity, but it beats giving your real followers excuses to attack each other.
