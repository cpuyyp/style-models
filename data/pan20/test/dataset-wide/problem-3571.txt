Exactly. That just means it's a case of discipline. All fit people who used to be skinny, had to go through this. It's a rite of passage. Getting fit isn't comfortable. Most of us are lazy, but if you want something, you're going to have to work for it, and sacrifice some comfort. If you don't have the discipline to eat properly, then you're not going to get fit. 

Dead hangs. Find a bar where you can hang straight down without touching the floor, and challenge yourself to hang there for a total of 1 minute. If you can't do it in one go, just drop down, give yourself 5 seconds, then get up and continue. As you progress, you can increase the total time, or keep challenging yourself to 1 minute, and see if you can decrease the amount of times you fall off. Dead holds. Same concept, but instead of hanging from a bar, you load a barbell up with some weight, and do the same thing as above. For variety, you can mix up how much weight you use and/or your goal time. 

Press exercise orders has nothing to do with fat loss. In fact, weight training does very little in terms of burning fat in the first place. Fat loss is primarily done in the kitchen. But weight training will affect how your body adapts to the changes, so there's that. 

You're not necessarily doing something wrong. Could be that you're experiencing lasting fatigue due to lasting calorie deficiency. How is your bodyweight? Have you been gaining or losing weight? 

Building on JJosaur's answer, there's also the issue of muscular imbalances. Chest muscles pull your shoulders forward. Back muscles pull your shoulders back. If one set of muscles is completely over-developed compared to the other, your posture, and in turn your back, will take a severe hit in the long run. This is usually never a problem for the case of back muscles overpowering the chest muscles. But the other way around is quite frequent, and if you pay attention, you can literally spot people every day that suffer from this, unknowingly or not. They'll be hunched forward over a hollow/concave chest. Doing thousands of pushups every week can very easily lead to this, but thankfully, there are bodyweight exercises for your back as well, namely pullups. I would think that a person who can perform a thousand pushups in a day will be able to do at least some pullup variation. 

No. Gaining muscle does not directly equate to losing fat. Case in point; it's possible to gain both at the same time. What is more likely, is that through gaining muscle, you have lowered your bodyfat percentage. There's more fat, but a smaller percentage of it overall. It's the bodyfat percentage that mostly dictates muscle visibility and definition. 

If you can sleep easily while still digesting a meal, go for it. There's no harm, other than the potential loss of sleep. Try it out, and see how your body deals with it. If you still wake up well rested, it's fine. It's common to wake up and have to use the bathroom if you ate a meal just before bed. It's also pretty common to experience nightmares because your body isn't completely at rest. But bottom line is; try it, and see for yourself. 

This is the physical law which dictates that if I push you, you automatically push me back. The reason why you fall and I don't, is that my stance was more balanced (I was leaning into into it because I was ready for it, as the perpetrator), and I absorbed the recoil. This is the same thing that happens when firing a gun. The bullet is pushed forward, but the gun is equally pushed back. But the gun is blunt and not sharp, meaning you don't get harmed holding on to it because the impact is spread out over a larger surface area. But to the point...! For your example, let's focus on the weight in your left hand. When you push this weight forward, it will push you backwards with an equal amount of force. This means you'll spend slightly more energy accelerating. When the weight is pushed all the way forward, it has to stop for a moment, before it returns. You will then start pulling the weight backward, but the weight will also pull you forward. This is where you get the feeling of being assisted. But whatever force you exert in order to move the weight, is mirrored onto you. So when the weight is pulled all the way back again, and you start to push it forward, it will push you back, making this part of the motion detrimental to your forward momentum. Now, for the case of both weights, it's exactly the same, but alternating (because when you push one weight, you pull the other weight). In other words, this all adds up to 0 total assistance gained from the weights. But this does not mean that running with weights is pointless, because the energy you spent running is moderated by the weight of your body, and whatever else you're moving (clothes, backpack etc). So if you're holding some extra weight, that's more energy spent per step. Quick tip; the benefits of extra weight is more beneficial when doing uphill cardio, because the energy spent gaining altitude is directly, and linearly dependent on the mass (weight) of your body and baggage. So in conclusion, carrying weights while running is indeed beneficial, but it does not assist you in any way. At the end of the day, the assistance you get from the momentum of the weight, is momentum you spent energy starting in the first place. The feeling of being assisted there, is simply you reaping what you sowed! 

Like @AlexL, I'm worried that you're not eating enough, and that your body is adapting by shorting some processes, rather than burning fat. What you have to understand, is that in order to be healthy, you have to have a healthy diet. Too many people try to lose weight by trying diets that exclude this and that. The problem there is that they're excluding important nutrients, vitamins and minerals, simply because the food also has, say, sugar. You seem to be in the habit of counting calories, and that's very good! But try to make sure of these things; 

More often than not, if you want to work on form, you should decrease the weight. If your form breaks, it does so when the load is high. Naturally there are exceptions to this rule, as there are to any rule, but if you've found an exercise where heavy weights force you into strict form, you've found a magical exercise. That said, make sure you know good and bad form, and that you're not simply making the assumption that the heavy weight reps were the good ones. 

I can see that you're quite reluctant to go the gym for pure bodyweight exercises, and that's understandable. But if you want to build muscle AND get a lean physique, then bodyweight is probably the hardest way to do so. In that case, I'd recommend looking into some more advanced calisthenics. 

I don't think starting SL5x5 should be a problem, because the first thing you do is test your 1RM, and have the numbers for your program set to percentages of that. So at the end of a cut, if you're weaker than normal, then it's perfectly reasonable to work with lower weights than you normally would. So long as you rely on a fresh 1RM test, and don't use a previous one that is possibly higher than your current, you won't stagnate as fast, so you'd also be able to cut a bit longer before phasing into a surplus regimen. 

Yes / no / YES. The best way to get rid of fat is to take control of your diet. And your workout routine should include your entire body, and not just one part of it. Any workout program that targets only abs, is a supplemental program. Not a full program. 

The short of it: No. Absolutely not ideal. If you want the best results, leg day is the most important day. This is the day where you use the largest bulk of muscles (and not just legs either). How to improve your approach The biggest issue here is that you're working only your upper body, but forgetting legs and lower back. Legs and lower back are what you work to reduce your risk of injury, and become a better athlete altogether. Legs and lower back are what you work to increase how much calories you burn by default, because it requires more effort from your heart and central nervous system (CNS). Your balance will improve, your endurance will improve, your metabolism will improve, your back will improve, and let's face it, this is the most important thing at any age, but more so the older you get. But don't worry, there are some freely available pre-programmed schedules that anyone can just pick up and use, and one of my favorite ones to advocate is Stronglifts 5x5. And before you ask; yes. Any age. :) 

Workout program First off, I hope you're doing more than just the 5 exercises in the article you linked to. Those exercises are indeed a good set of exercises for the upper back, but good posture is only achieved through exercising the entire body! Intensity and volume parameters When deciding your set/rep ranges, one often asks "do I want to focus on strength, or size?" Naturally, in most cases, focusing on one, will lead to improvements in the other. As a rule of thumb, we like to divide the rep ranges into 3 basic stages; 

Rectifying imbalances is not something you do by working the weaker side more than the other, as suggested in another answer. Consider your scenario. You might have a stronger left-side bicep than right-side. However, if you were to do more curls on the right side, you're also training the right-side forearm and shoulder. You're also training the left-side core muscles because they will be doing more counter-balancing work since you place more weight (or doing more reps) on the right side. In other words, you're substituting one imbalance, for a plethora of new ones. The most surefire way to balance out unequalities, is by simply training them equally. As for your bicep workout progression, it's hard to say without knowing anything about your workout. But then again, bicep curls are an isolation exercise. You might be better off doing it at the end of an upper back workout (which engages biceps a lot) for the added bicep hypertrophy.
