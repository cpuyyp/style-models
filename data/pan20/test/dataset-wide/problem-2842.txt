Regarding point 1, I refer to the following definition of explanatory reductionism and ontological reductionism from (4): 

Human progress – technological, scientific, social, etc. – seeks to reduce, and ultimately totally eliminate, the aspects of life we perceive as unpleasant – loss, tragedy, suffering ... However, an argument can be made that we require a possibility for "unpleasant" aspects of life - i.e. a conflict to be overcome - in order to build an identity and construct a meaning that will transcend the state of being best described by Nietzsche's formulation of "last man": 

I will argue that Dawkins is wrong in the sense that his notions of warmth and awed wonder refer to something entirely else than those implied by at least some opposing views. What's immediately obvious is that some people feel that science takes something away from life. This goes at least as far back as 19th century romanticism (1): 

Like Feynman, it is this appreciation of scientific description that Dawkins is talking about, and feels awed wonder towards. If we define awe and wonder as in (4): 

If we assume explanatory scientific reductionism, then the fact that objective mechanisms predeterminate subjective experience doesn't automatically negate the reality of subjective experience, or its importance. If instead we assume ontological scientific reductionism, subjectivity becomes a mere emergent illusion underpinned by a more fundamental reality. Point 2 refers to personal beliefs impacting the response one has to scientific claims. For instance, similarly to what atheists like Dawkins and Feynman are describing, a deeply religious person may experience more awe and wonder because of an added scientific perspective, although for a different reason: she may marvel at how a deity has constructed the world to be full of such and such physical interactions, etc. However, some people may feel that ontological reductionism imposes materialism, which is in contradiction with some beliefs or hopes. In this sense, scientific knowledge can taint experience as a harbinger of unpleasant truths, and stands in opposition to the type of awe and wonder grounded on convictions that science undermines.

Assumption is a perception of inconclusiveness and cannot be used to obtain the fact of anything, which conclusion should lead to from a rational argument. Any interpretation should not come from a basis of assumption if you conclude that rational argument is a process that returns fact. Science adopts a method of argument from a conception or theory and a test of that through experiment and the data returned from that test which is statistically analysed empirically to affirm or reject the theory based upon a probability of certainty that cannot ever return an absolute. It is certainly an assumption that this method returns any truth based on its application which logically opposes its own nature from its uncertainty and its attempt at truth. Which leads to an interpretation of anything but faith with an absence of any other method. 

Your argument is a consequence of the logic of the language you used to form it in morality and immorality and its observed concept and the language used to communicate it. Society or people in fact everything is limited by what physically is possible and what is not and the perception of a causal nature in the result of a choice in action of the possible and a return in the perceived pleasure or pain of that action or from experience of a similar action. I have felt also guilt from my actions now I don't know if its a result of conditioning of society or an absolute return in the nature of a choice I took and a fundament of an immoral act. Society judges immoral act upon a notion of guilt and an attempt to keep order from that guilt but its hard to say if every immoral act judged by society results in a guilty feeling absolutely and should accumulate a social judgement of morality from that percieved guilty feeling. 

Is his claim that Noam Chomsky rejects Darwinian evolution true, and if so, on what grounds does Chomsky do so? 

So, instead of the "anything that exists has a cause of its existence," it is closer in meaning to "anything that begins to exist has a cause." The kalam cosmological argument does not even attempt to prove that "everything that begins to exist has a cause," but assumes this as a premise. This premise is often defended as self-evident or as following from a commonly accepted proposition such as the Causal Principle, but these defenses are not part of the kalam cosmological argument per se. 

A strategy that tends to result in short and easy to understand proofs is to immediately assume the negation of the sentence you're trying to prove and then make derivations until you find a contradiction. Having found a contradiction allows you to deduce the negation of the sentence you assumed that lead to the contradiction (this is a valid inference rule called reductio ad absurdum). Here is an example: 

The rule of absorption can be proved via truth table (which is neither a "conditional proof" nor an "indirect proof") like so: 

If by "symbolic logic", you mean propositional logic, then the answer is that you can't (exactly). The closest you can come is the hypothetical syllogism: 

The only truth you can take is that in the language your using is formed as a function of the subject experiencing the object and the logic contained within the subject. Every thought you think is a consequence in the language you use and sequentially forms grammitical sentences based up your perception when you experienced learning it. Every thought you will ever have will be based up your level of knowledge of the dictionary of it and the rules learnt from your logic in the perception of the grammar and the construction of thoughts using the grammer and the dictionary. So yes for all intents and purpose yes we may be all experiencing a self induced simulation the means of which to perpetuate the need of the subject and the object the definition of which we have because of the difference observed. And the subject cannot directly observe itself only retropectively, but in the picture of it's self is dependent upon the language gained through objective experience and similarly limited in the reflection of it. The subject and object has to be experienced concurrently and a pyramid of simulation would have to occur simultaneously as a memory of sequence would occur that could question the nature of the object we are subject to and since I don't recall that memory to dispel the object I carry on lol. Since The persitance of memory shapes the subject from information in experiencing the object and gives us our only fact. It becomes a lonely world out there and therefore maybe faith is a greater truth than fact, as each is similarly indeterminate but the later I think more purpose. Well that was a load of flannel just keep your sense of humour mate. Sorry invidullators I should keep this discussion professional I know. And take a load of the grammar I use, l know my limitations :). 

then reductionist science is in conflict with neither; it's possible to experience both awe and wonder while trying to understand a phenomenon in scientific terms. Perhaps a more fundamental question would be whether the ultimate goal of science is to eliminate all space for awe and wonder by providing a complete understanding of everything; i.e., is it possible, assuming the definitions above, to experience awe and wonder about something when it is understood completely? But that is a different question. However, I think both Feynman and Dawkins (assuming he would agree with Feynman) miss something crucial here. For scientific understanding to add to the appreciation of an experience, two conditions must be met: 

explanatory reductionism, rather than ontological reductionism is assumed; one is at peace with potential implications of scientific understanding, and does not experience cognitive dissonance because of it. 

A common criticism of Christianity is that it is too limited in time and space for its claims to be true: Christianity has only been around for a relatively short period of humanity's existence, and has only been prevalent in certain parts of the world. Most people could never have become Christians as they never encountered Christian teachings - so why would being a Christian as established later in history be required for salvation (i.e. Heaven), assuming that God is just? Intuitively, this argument makes a lot of sense: if most people in history lived without any notion of Christian teachings and Christian God, why would the latter require belief and a certain way of life for people to be be allowed to live in an afterlife they had no knowledge of in the first place? One possible counterargument could be that historical Christian teachings are only to orient and assist people, who are otherwise meant to come to similar (Christian-like) conclusions regarding normative morality on their own. This reasoning, of course, is not without problems as it renders the specifics of Christianity irrelevant and reduces it to the level or mere practical morality. Another possible counterargument is that the interpretation of Christianity assumed in the question is wrong, and that e.g. God can be just while those who are not Christians (for whatever reason) cannot be saved - the problem then becomes about the notion of justice as attributed to God. Does the problem have a common name in philosophy? Has it been addressed more rigorously by philosophers, particularly from the Christian apologetics perspective? Are there common counterarguments? If so, are they specifically Christian, or could they be used to defend other religions? I'm particularly interested in the work of modern and contemporary philosophers, as well as theoretical analyses of implications of the potential resolutions. 

Can't we simply use common sense in the statements negation the statements truth could only come from observation but it is an assumption. It contains a nature in its content which is contradictory ie eating when not hungry question the nature of the truth of the observation. The negation "Jakie does not eat sweets if she is hungry" is the common sense negation and results in a similar contradiction in the meaning of the content and maintains the possible truth or assumption in the observation. The logic applied is not an analysis in the nature of the determination of the contradiction in the statement and the negation, or the truth of the observation the statement comes from, but in the negation of the structure and syntax of the language the statement is a composition of. 

Reductionism leads to division, division leads to separation and to partition, partition fences the whole with its partition and results in objection from the subjection because of the division and its incompleteness in its own argument, and an nature of the innumerate quantity of it and its premise. Wholism comes from no pretence of its own absolute and disregards that nature of quantity from a reference of reduction and its negation but in a quality that transcends the material to give value to its conception not by a quantitative measure of that value but an intangeable quality determined without reference to scale or similar measurement. Are you happy on a scale of one to ten? are you fing kidding me!! Newton gave rise to an exlanation of the world from his three laws and the consequence give rise to determinism and a fact upon his argument of the past the present and future. The spectrum reduced colour as a fraction of vibration but colour may as well be a degree of black and white because of infinite division and a quantity associated with that division as well as the whole spectrum of EMR. Our consiousness gives rise to colour and sound and attributes value from the properties of our senses and is more important than the mechanism that affords it explained by science in the nature of its process. Quality in my mind preceeds quantity and has a greater importance than the measure that science atemmpts and uses as an explanation. Reductionism in its own definition allows the concept of wholism and vice versa but is more mechanistic in its approach and leads to measurement which is a product of division with no absolute scale that a whole gives no value to other than the presence of its quality. I dont think that what we observe is reduced to mechanism and construction it can be argued that the reality we observe is artificial compared to God and we are subject of that artificialality in its creation unless its a perfect example of Gods judgement upon his own enviroment and unquestionable replication, but explanation leads to an argument of fact and just where does the fact lie within the pyramid. 

Both of these notations are semantically equivalent, so use whichever seems more intuitive unless you are operating under additional constraints such as course requirements. For both notations, it is common to read the first premise symbolically as "for all x, if x has property P, then x has property Q," the second premise as "for all x, if x has property Q, then x has property R," and the conclusion as "for all x, if x has property P, then x has property R." 

There is no such thing as the cosmological argument. Rather, there is a class of arguments that share similar themes and (sometimes) logical structure, but that rely on different premises that are all referred to as cosmological arguments. For instance, a cosmological argument defended by Aquinas depends on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress. On the other hand, the Leibnizian cosmological argument depends mostly on the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Given the wording of your question, you are most likely referring to the kalam cosmological argument, which has a premise that is similar to, but importantly different from what you stated. The argument is usually formulated as follows: 

The above notation is preferred by many philosophers, while mathematicians might prefer notation like this: 

But, if truth tables presuppose the law of excluded middle, then it would seem that the rule of absorption is not provable within the constraints you've imposed. 

For example, consider a scientist who derives meaning from his quest to discover a cure for a horrible disease – this quest requires the disease to exist in the first place. By discovering a cure (i.e. contributing to progress), he eliminates some suffering, but he also denies this same quest to others who will come after him. Similar arguments can be made for all areas of human endeavor - even great art is usually based on conflict and some variation of suffering. Assuming a hypothetical limit of human progress where all negative aspects of life - or perhaps all problems - have been removed, could individuals derive autonomous meaning that would objectively transcend the dystopian Brave New World, last man-like state? Or would we be forced to face existential boredom where precisely the arbitrary malleability of reality due to our omnipotence (even e.g. immortality) would force us to - as Zapffe put it - "artificially limit the content of [our] consciousness" by means of e.g. cognitive control in order to preserve sanity, and in the process transform the human condition to the level of last men? To put it differently: if we define technological progress as an optimization problem that seeks to minimize suffering and/or conflict, is the paradox of technological progress then that the only state of being it ultimately allows is the one of induced "last men", a kind of maximum existential entropy?
