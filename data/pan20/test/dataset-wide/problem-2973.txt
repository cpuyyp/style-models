Given the second law of thermodynamics, everything is unravelling, rolling down hill. Everything ends. We all die. Civilisations collapse. Our conventional sources of motivation in 'the grand scheme', are meaningless, pointless, irrelevant. So, we are all Sisyphus. We set ourselves tasks, they unravel, either before or after our deaths. So why do anything? Camus is saying don't turn to 'the grand scheme', meaning gas never resided outside ourselves, can never be 'found' in the world. Accept that being happy is a creative, imaginative act, which we must turn to ourselves for, and to living authentic lives - living with a full heart. Edit to add: 'We must imagine Sisyphus happy' can be looked at as parallel to Hume's 'Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions'. We cannot reason our way into happiness, it is an irrational, absurd act, to be happy. 

You could make a much better case from what you quote for atheism or deism. Luciferianism has always existed more as a smear than a coherent theology, and there is a history of trying to apply it to discrediting freemasonry $URL$ The only serious attempt I know of to examine what the self-declared Illuminati were historically, is Niall Ferguson's in "The Square and the Tower: Networks, Hierarchies and the Struggle for Global Power". There is quite a detailed discussion of this part of the book in the Waking Up podcast episode #117 "Networks Power and Chaos" $URL$ Umberto Eco's "Foucault's Pendulum" is a work of fiction that illustrates the way the idea of secret and hidden societies can become a screen to project ourselves on, and a tar baby to absorb energy and creativity. 

Do statistics. Understanding statistics is key to understanding what we know about the world. Yes in science like Type 1 & 2 hypothesis testing, but also $URL$ Continental philosophy is especially focused on language, and maths helps to analyse it and draw meaningful conclusions about information transfer, language evolution, and other patterns. Basic mathematical proof theory, like $URL$ can give insight into mathematical Incompleteness, which is key to the rise of the Continental programme over the Analytic. Maths is fun. Do it. 

Evil is a slippery term. In it's conventional use, it draws on a vague psycological archetype of some 'thing' wholely negative, malicious, destructive. Religious justification is often sought for such a simplistic view of evil, because on even very shallow analysis it falls apart. Dictators invariably believed at least initially they were doing good, or at least neccessary, things, and could be talked out of bad methods in principle. Psycopaths are ill, and can be healed. Temptation and the fall, went against god's directions, but the fruit of the tree of knowledge can be seen as obviously neccessary, like recieving fire from Prometheus. When we examine notions and examples of evil, and how and why it exists, we have to see it as behaviour that is pathological and needs healing for the benefit of the acted upon and the evil actor themselves. A psycotherapist looks at impulses, that generate motivations. These are sources of vitality, when integrated and properly harnessed. Can impulses at core be evil? Possibly, in a sick person. But they arise from our biological needs, our desire for health and wholeness and wellbeing. The therapeutic perspective is that people can be healed, meaning wholesome impulses generated. Our fundamental nature cannot be aimed against itself, that can only have been aquired. Actual evil actions are capable of being redeemed, like people are capable of being healed. Where does the energy in the motivation come from? In so far as it is evil, it is vitality aimed against itself. Vitality, rooted in our biological being, seeks to regenerate itself, to be reclaimed into positive cycles. 

If the probability is non-zero, and the trial is run infinite times, then the outcome will necessarily happen, by definition. Infinity is a mathematical tool with exactly that purpose. You could run the trial for the age of the universe however, and it potentially never happen. 

This involves a fu damental misunderstanding about what science is. But that's not unusual, in fact a lot of scientists share it. Because they think philosophy can just stay in it's box, and don't recognise the underpinnings of their endeavors. You mistake technology, including ideas, for science. Ancient cultures developed electroplating $URL$ $URL$ Does this mean they had electricity? Obviously, no. Compare these to what $URL$ did in his lifetime. He took a hodgepodge of electrical a d magnetic phenomena, and through a series of systematic experiments and mathematics, unified electricity and magnetism into four short equations. This is the essence of what science is about, sytematic, unifying, experimental. Not technology, which is purely incidental. It is interesting to note widespread phenomena of $URL$ And we might add to such, development of written language $URL$ Developments of ideas, and technologies however does not necessarily mean full development of their consequences $URL$ There has been a widespread tendency in the West to overlook or underestimate cultures and societies elsewhere. No doubt that needs a corrective. But science is about finding fundamental principles that minimise assumptions and maximise explanatory power. It is about integrating and unifying methods and ideas. Not only did that not develop elsewhere, it took a lot longer to fully develop here than most people realise. Newton was an astrological alchemist, as well as a scientist. Notation and symbolic abstraction is exactly the point. 

This question, like a lot of Christian thinking, suffers from a lack of insight into Judaism. It is the Hellenic tradition that prompted identifying Christ with God, and chose 9 months after spring equinox for Christmas out of synchretism with Sol Invictus. Hel was never mentioned until well after Jesus died, because it's the Norse domain of the unrighteous dead (vs Valhalla). The Jewish tradition is about a people with a covenant with God, chosen for a purpose. God is explicitly stated to be beyond our conception, with purposes unknowable to us. Moses refers to other peoples having their own relationship with God, and to prophets outside of the Jewish community. They interpret this into, "Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come". The Jewish tradition of salvation is more like, being woven onto God's plan, rather than part of a metaphysical carrot-and-stick. There is not enough discussion within the Christian community of how exegesis has been done, and what the options are. The rabbinical tradition, by opening up much more to questioning, has made for more coherent and consistent interpretation. This soteriological problem of evil, not only causes problems like Dante having to put Aristotle and others in the first circle of Hell. But much more widely, assuming aliens are found to be as common as expected, for uncountable billions of species including those in parts of the universe beyond our light cone, so literally impossible to ever interact with. 

Read Sartre's Existentialism and Humanism, not just an explanation of a quote. 'True existential condition' - what have you presupposed that to be? The attempt to 'get rid of guilt' sounds exactly the worst way to address guilt. Atonement for wrongs done, reconciliation between enemies, and healing from damage, are ways to deal with guilt that have a history of working. Shoving it into a corner and imperiously declaring it irrational - not so much. I blame a lot of what you seem to assume on Descartes. Rationality as a kind of isolation from causes and conditions. Take up some Wittgenstein, learn how there is no Private Language, no ivory tower to survey reality from. We can only think at all, because we care what other people think. More broadly, there is this idea that we should first be concerned with ourselves, and relational behaviour is an optional extra. But research shows that is very much not the case - altruism is the instinct, and egoism the learned behaviour: Is Psychological Egoism true? Did C Daniel Batson refute it? Take a deep breath. Count your blessings. Look for what is good in your life and nourishes you, and cultivate that. 

it occurs in languages, social conventions of use that occur through culture and community. Meaning does not exist in the world, but only in minds, in community with each other. Mathematics and geometry are not just a matter of progressively unpacking axioms. They need a backwards-and-forwards process between minds and the world and between people. From set theory to Incompleteness, the tools and insights occur not as insights of isolated brains, but in dialectics, discussions, in adding to and refining meaning which has context only through our lives and community. 

In a classical universe, it may be possible in principle to predict things, but impossible in practice. So we use predictors like character and identity instead of just initial conditions. In a quantum universe, there is $URL$ So, in these views free will is the subjective experience, even in a deterministic system. Fate is usually used in a different sense though, in terms of inner qualities or characteristics which must inevitably manifest, in a way that can't be subverted by rational choice or other subset of who someone is, that results from their whole being. Perhaps that they were born with, or was otherwise predetermined. So I suggest you can have choice, determinism, and fate, all separately. Always seemed to me determinism is borne out of cognitive bias, rather than any specific observations though. If you can't solve the problem of induction, how can determinism even be meaningful? It would be beyond any possible science to observe it as logically required or inevitable, or even as set to continue. Quantum mechanics has further shown god does play dice, and not just with the future, with the past. 

I am a bit surprised by the hostility to the concept of this question, given that it is a classic problem restated by nearly every serious philosopher. If your stance is, 'I don't want to think about it', fair enough. No one is making you. This thread is clearly stated as being about evidence for or against. You might have saved everyone time if you didnt want to address that. I found this great article, that I'd say answers my question as thoroughly as it's going to be. Please consider what it has to say if you have been argueing this is a meaningless question. "David Chalmers has argued that we should consider the 'simulation hypothesis' not as a skeptical hypothesis that threatens our having knowledge of the external world but as a metaphysical hypothesis regarding what our world is actually made of. " $URL$ The Peer-To-Peer Reality model framed here seems to me directly comparable to the Yogacara Mind-Only school's stance. The objection around nested or recursive realities can be seen as being directly addressed by Nagarjuna, as described here: $URL$ Buddhist thought acknowledges reality is confusing, it does not throw hands up and refuse to engage. This avenue of thought looks to be a route towards recognising the sophistication of some Buddhist thinkers.
