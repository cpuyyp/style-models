The basic premise of your question is faulty: the American defenses weren't wiped out. Look at the list of what the Japanese hit (from Wikipedia): 

From the standpoint of the ancient Greeks, the aeolipile is a technological dead end. As an engine in its own right, it's useless for more than toys/temple wonders: it produces negligible torque, and does so in a horribly inefficient manner -- the slave you've got stoking the fire to run your aeolipile-powered device would be far more productive if he let the fire go out and did the task himself. As a predecessor to other steam technologies, it's also a dead end. There's no obvious transition from it to the steam piston, which the Greeks might have been able to build. If you turn the aeolipile inside-out, you get the steam turbine, but making turbines efficient enough to be worth using requires a knowledge of metallurgy, precision machining, and aerodynamics far beyond what the ancient Greeks had. 

During the first world war all of Ireland was within the United Kingdom. In C. S. Lewis's autobiographical book Surprised by Joy he says that as an Irishman (from Belfast) he was exempt from conscription during the first world war. (He joined the army and was wounded in combat, and many of his schoolmates were killed.) I am guessing that attempts to conscript Irishmen at that time might have been resisted with widespread violence, but that's just a guess. Why were they exempt? 

ZIP codes were introduced in 1963, and ZIP is an acronym for "Zone Improvement Plan." ZIP codes were to be an improvement on "postal zones". Thus before ZIP codes existed one would write: John Xmith3001 Zarthan Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The number 16 was the zone number; this address was in postal zone 16 within the city of Minneapolis. This number followed the name of the city and preceded the name of the state, and was not used in small towns having only one post office. When ZIP codes were introduced, in most cases the zone number became the last two digits of the ZIP code. Thus the address above became this: John Xmith3001 Zarthan Avenue Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416 (If I'm not mistaken, in 1963, the Postmaster General was a member of the president's cabinet, heading the "Department of the Post Office". He was one of two cabinet members who headed the Department of Something but who were not called the Secretary of Something, but instead the Something(else) General. The other one still exists: the head of the Department of Justice is not called the Secretary of Justice, but the Attorney General.) 

What you describe are skirmisher tactics, not guerrilla fighting, though guerrillas do usually use them. Skirmisher tactics are highly effective against a linear infantry formation if you don't intend to hold the field. Taking aimed shots from a distance and reloading from cover lets the skirmishers inflict disproportionately high casualties. Success depends on being able to move out of the way of the advancing army, though: if they ever manage to close in on the skirmishers, the superior numbers and volume of fire from the linear formation will tear the skirmishers to shreds. This means that if a linear formation is willing to absorb the casualties, skirmishers can't stop them. Skirmishers are also highly vulnerable to cavalry charges. Until the development of quick-loading weapons, only compact infantry formations had the volume of fire or the density of bayonets/pikes to keep cavalry away. A skirmisher can't move fast enough to get out of the way, can only fire one or maybe two shots before the cavalry arrives, and is at a distinct disadvantage in a close-range fight. 

Is there any account of the politics of the revisions of Vermont's constitution in 1793? When Vermont was admitted to the Union on March 4, 1791, it continued to function under the constitution of 1786 that was written while Vermont was an independent country (and which in turn superseded the constitution of 1777). On this matter it is very easy to surmise that a major motive of the revision was deletion of the lengthy condemnations of the two former enemy states, Britain and New York. It seems especially inappropriate to continue to speak officially of New York as an enemy after admission to the Union. (It just occurred to me that I don't know at what point the confiscations from, and deportations of, "Yorkers" ended in Vermont. In 1784 after the U.S. concluded peace with the British (and the British ceded Vermont to the U.S. although Vermont's government didn't recognize that), the governor of New York was actively threatening to invade Vermont and asking for the support of Congress in so doing.) But a surmise about the motives is not an account of events. In particular, did the Council of Censors recommend the revision? (Robert Mello's definitive biography of Moses Robinson says nothing about the 1793 revision. I conclude that Robinson --- at that time a U.S. senator --- did not participate this time around.) 

When triggered, a bounding mine propels itself into the air, then explodes, spraying shrapnel over a large area. To maximize the effectiveness, the shrapnel pattern is largely horizontal (shrapnel thrown upwards into the air or blown into the ground at the base of the mine is wasted). This means that, in general, the best way to survive a bounding mine is to throw yourself flat on the ground, face down. If you're close enough, most of the shrapnel will pass over you. The best-known bounding mines, the German S-Mine class, had a four-second time delay on the fuse. This gave a person or vehicle triggering the mine time to move away so they wouldn't prevent the mine from rising into the air, but it also gave them time to take evasive action if they realized they'd triggered it. 

Mathematicians are better at mathematics than at history, and have perpetuated an error concerning what Euclid did. They frequently state in textbooks and elsewhere that Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers is by contradiction. But it is not. Euclid considered what happens if you multiply finitely many prime numbers and then add 1. For example: (2 × 11 × 37) + 1 = 815 The number you get cannot be divisible by any of the finitely many prime numbers you started with. 815 cannot be divisible by 2 because 814 is; 815 cannot be divisible by 11 because 814 is; 814 cannot be divisible by 37 because 814 is. (The next prime number after 814 that is divisible by 37 is 814+37; the next after 814 that is divisible by 11 is 814+11; the next after 814 that is divisible by 2 is 814+2.) Therefore, whichever prime numbers 815 is divisible by, whether it is prime itself or not, cannot be among the finitely many you started with (in this example 2, 11, and 37). (In fact 815 is 5 × 163, and 5 and 163 are prime.) In this way it is seen that every finite list of prime numbers can be extended to a longer finite list of prime numbers. That is how Euclid prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. Catherine Woodgold and I wrote a joint paper in which we refuted the historical error and explained some practical reasons why it matters: Michael Hardy and Catherine Woodgold, "Prime Simplicity", Mathematical Intelligencer, volume 31, number 4, fall 2009, pages 44–52. I learned only after the paper appeared that the historical error may have originated with Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. It appears in his posthumous book on number theory. 

Although the two formations look similar, the pike square was developed in a very different tactical environment than the phalanx. The phalanx and the maniple were developed in an environment where the primary weapons were swords, spears, and occasionally slings. Cavalry was rare, and was typically light cavalry used as skirmishers or to protect an army's flanks. Infantry was the supreme fighting force, and the maniple and phalanx were both developed as a counter to infantry. The phalanx and the maniple were both employed offensively: to push against the enemy's formation and break it. The Renaissance, on the other hand, was the tail end of a period when heavy cavalry was the dominant force. Ranged weapons such as bows, cannon, and early handheld firearms were common, and infantry were considered a "yes, we've also got some of them" force by many commanders. Tactically, the job of a pike square is to provide a defensive formation: to keep enemy cavalry away from your artillery and to keep enemy cavalry and infantry away from your arquebusiers (see: pike and shot). The job of breaking the enemy formation was given to the other elements of the army. 

Do any writings about Saint Patrick written while he lived survive, other than what he wrote himself? Is he actually known to have died on the 17th of March? (I'm guessing he didn't write that himself.) When Patrick was first taken to Ireland as a slave, how much communication and commerce existed between Ireland and the rest of the world? Did that substantially increase with the conversion of the Irish to Christianity? 

In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect in the states that had ratified it, and that meant elections had to be organized for representatives in Congress and for members of the electoral college (in those days I suspect they were literally for electors and the presidential candidates were not named on the ballots). Today all presidential elections and elections for members of congress were held on the same day throughout the country. Was that done in 1788? If so, who organized it? Was the Congress of the Confederation involved? (Elections for U.S. senators were done by state legislatures then, and I suspect they were not all on the same day.) 

Were there any instances where high-altitude bombing of ships had a significant impact, or even managed to hit the intended target? 

Wikipedia has an example Bill of Mortality from 1665, listing the causes of death for the London area. Many of the terms in it are unfamiliar, though, eg. "Kings Evill", "Rupture", "Livergrown". In modern terms, what are these people recorded as dying of? 

If the photograph is from 1905, then the ship is one of USS Pennsylvania, USS West Virginia, USS Colorado, or USS Maryland, as the other ships of those two classes were commissioned in the 1906-1908 timeframe. There's a decent chance that it's the USS West Virginia, since that ship served with the New York Naval Militia. 

In short, politics. The Flensburg Government (Doenitz's German government) wanted to surrender to the Western allies (the United States and United Kingdom) rather than the Allies as a whole, primarily because of the Soviet reputation for how they (mis)treated prisoners. To this end, Admiral Friedeburg was sent to Field Marshal Montgomery's headquarters. Montgomery was unwilling to accept such a surrender, but Friedeburg was able to negotiate a partial surrender, of forces in Denmark, the Netherlands, and northwestern Germany, including the U-Boat forces. This had the effect of being a surrender to the Western allies, since they were the ones who controlled or were adjacent to these areas. Between the May 4 partial surrender and the May 8 total surrender, German refugees and troops frantically tried to reach Western allied lines to surrender; this included several breakout attempts by forces encircled by the Soviets. On May 7, General Eisenhower informed the Flensberg Government that further attempted surrenders by German troops to the Western forces would not be accepted, which lead to the May 8 unconditional surrender of all forces to the Allies as a whole. 

In the 18th century, if I understand correctly, the king of England appointed the governors of the thirteen colonies in North America. How far beyond royal appointments of governors did British rule extend? One obvious answer is that in the 1760s the British Parliament began trying to impose taxes on Americans --- money to be sent from America to Britain. Another is that when Britain went to war against France in 1756, colonial Americans helped the British conquer the French colony of Canada. After the taxation laws of the 1760s some American statesmen took the position that the colonies had their own legislatures and, although they were subjects of the same king as the British, and the king therefore appointed their governors, the British Parliament had no more right to legislate for America the the Virginia House of Burgesses had to legislate for England. So a question is: before the tax acts, how extensive was legislation by Parliament that was intended to be enforced in America, and how effective was the enforcement? Added somewhat later: Another instance of governing from England was the order-in-council signed by King George III on July 20, 1764, stating that the disputed territory claimed by both New York and New Hampshire belonged to New York. That disputed territory is what later became the state of Vermont. The ruling followed an ex-parte hearing, i.e. the king and council heard from only one side: the province of New York. Then in 1767 a further order was issued in response to a petition from the inhabitants of the "New Hampshire Grants", as that territory was then called, saying the province of New York ought to recognize New Hampshire land grants issued before the order-in-council of 1764. However, this was clearly not routine governance. 

Historically, there weren't multiple Portuguese colonies in South America. There was just one. The Portuguese governed Brazil as a single unit since 1549, when the failed Captaincies were merged. This became the Viceroyalty of Brazil (1775), the Kingdom of Brazil (1815, still ruled by the Portuguese Crown), the independent Empire of Brazil (1822, when Pedro I rebelled against his father, the King of Portugal), and finally the current republic (1889). In contrast, the Spanish colonies were governed as multiple independent areas. 

"Latino" or "Hispanic" refers to an American with a cultural heritage from Spain as filtered through Latin America, and says nothing about their genetic ancestry. "Taino" refers to someone with a genetic and cultural heritage from the Taino peoples of the Caribbean. A resident of Puerto Rico could be either, or neither, or both. 

The term you're looking for is chronology (Wikipedia's article on the subject is rather sub-par). In general, there are two major ways of synchronizing dates.
