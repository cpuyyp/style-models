Technological unknowns give you the freedom to shape your future as you see fit. Consider some other questions: -How hard is human-level intelligence to simulate, really? At the moment, it's not clear how far we are from having sentient computers. The human brain is a fantastically complicated piece of organic computing, and programmers are having to replicate the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution by hand. You could decide, for the sake of your fiction, that neural nets and quantum computing are right around the corner, making a future where intelligent computer software is commonplace. On the other hand, you could posit that even with advances in technology, a sentient intelligence capable of replacing the common soldier is still beyond reach. Also, if intelligent machines are readily available, androids could be more economical even if they're more expensive or difficult to produce than simply turning a human into an equivalent cyborg. Remember, training a soldier is expensive, as is raising a human to military age. There is a finite limit on how many conscripts a nation can summon for military service at any given time, before you start running out of people, and it takes time to train them for combat (let alone convert them into cyborgs). Androids neatly sidestep these issues. -How important is the human element? Is sending cyborgs into combat, risking human life, less politically acceptable than sending robots? Do we trust robots to employ lethal force, or do we want a human pulling the trigger? Robots don't need veterans' associations, ongoing pay and employment in peacetime, or retirement benefits, so what ancillary costs are involved with cyborgs? Do you want tactical independence from your soldiery, or is that seen as a liability? -How hard is it to integrate cybernetics into the human body? Despite ongoing progress in prosthetic development, cybernetic augmentation is a complex subject. You can write a piece of computer software to drive a servo motor trivially using off-the-shelf components, but translating an electrical signal from the brain to perform the same operation is considerably more complex. There's also acclimation to the new changes, and constant issues of rejection by the host tissue. Building a wholly cybernetic, autonomous system to drive a piece of mission-relevant hardware might ultimately prove easier than trying to coerce the human body into supporting it. Or it might not. Maybe a wonder drug can solve rejection issues and a chip can translate crystal-clear instructions from your brain, making cybernetic augmentation easy and hassle-free. There's no simple, easy answer to your question. You have the freedom to modify the parameters of your setting to get the kind of balance you want. Whether you want all androids, all cyborgs, or a mix of the two for different roles, it is possible to construct an internally-consistent set of justifications for your stylistic choices. 

I'm wondering if a pine forest with near-constant rain and thunder could be possible. I was thinking that possibly something like this could be created by high mountains next to this place, lightning-wise, or somewhere on a tidally locked planet, but I don't know a lot about this topic. What geographical and other conditions might create a place like this? 

This depends if they're 'right' next to each other. I would assume a day's walk is okay, which Wikipedia informs me is about 40 kilometers. On a tidally locked planet, there's a large ice side and desert side. But that's too large. Good thing we can lower the mass, while lowering diameter, to have the same gravity. Not sure about the exact measurements, and you could have a mountain range blocking light from getting to a specific area, which could just be cold enough for snow and ice to exist at all times. 

I'd say something psychological. Elves, in fiction, are known for their love of nature and such. If they eat something that came from a sentient being, it's possible that they start breaking out in hives, or become sick, not because they have a species-wide allergy, but because of their culture. 

To preface this, be aware that nuclear saltwater rockets don't involve nuclear reactors. The nuclear fuels are kept diluted as propellant and insulated in a neutron moderator, and the nuclear reaction that provides thrust occurs externally to the ship. The ship still needs an onboard power source, but if that source is non-nuclear (like solar panels), then when the engine is shut down the only significant radiation source would be due to transmutation of the engine components. So with that said, if you can tolerate the radioactivity of an inactive NSWR, then the solution is: Tugs. Tugs aren't just a solution for nuclear propulsion, they're a necessity for any setting involving large spacecraft which by virtue of their size will likely be little better at maneuvering near a space station than a supertanker is at maneuvering in port. You need small, maneuverable, powerful spacecraft to help guide the bigger ships into port anyways, which calls for a (non-radioactive) chemical rocket. You can shut down the nuclear reactor and run on battery power while the tugs bring you in to dock. Keep personnel away from the still-hot engine, but it will be much easier to shield against than a live engine. But if your engine is powerful enough to render its inactive components dangerously radioactive, then you'll need another solution. Launches. In the 17th-19th centuries, it was common for ships to stay at anchor outside of port, and use small boats (called launches) to ferry personnel and supplies between the ship and the port. Following this example, keep the ships at a safe distance whenever possible. Since radiation follows an inverse-cube falloff at distance, they shouldn't have to stay too far to keep bystanders within acceptable dosage limits. Use shuttles to convey personnel, and tugs to carry supplies, cargo, and equipment. If you need to work on the ship, bring a maintenance vessel (or mobile drydock to it). Alternatively: Modularity. As a third option, keep the radioactive drive unit separate from the crew habitat. This concept by artist William Black depicts an example, where a nuclear propulsion system and its propellant is a detachable module. The nuclear propulsion module is left a safe distance from the destination, while the chemical propulsion module completes the journey. This gives you the best of both worlds. A small chemical propulsion module can come in to dock with much greater maneuverability than the whole, without any danger of radioactive contamination. The ability to jettison the nuclear propulsion system might also be highly desirable when dealing with a nuclear saltwater rocket, which is almost literally a flying bomb and something you would want to get away from quickly if there were signs of imminent failure. On the flipside, modularity is expensive, complicated, and typically not as durable as a fixed design. This solution could conceivably coexist with one of the above methods, offering greater convenience and less logistical coordination in exchange for higher operational costs. Depending upon the details of your propulsion system and technological assumptions, all three of these solutions might coexist to different degrees. You can likely carve out different ecological niches for each approach within the same setting. 

I've only found out how to get the materials to make the wire. Back in the 1300s, your average English labourer earned about 672 grams of sterling per year, or about 2.1 grams per day. That converts to .20 cubic cm, then to 2800 cubic millimeters. Going through some more math, that would be 36 days worth of pay for a wire 100 meters long. Solution: rob a peasant. 

I can do something close, but yet entirely possible within our known sciences. In 1984, Larry Niven published a book called The Integral Trees. The setting is a vast gas torus, around a neutron star. The gas torus is a known object, and Niven did the math to make the setting scientifically accurate. This gas torus was formed by a gas giant's atmosphere being sucked into orbit around the neutron star. The gas torus was located 26,000 kilometers away from the neutron star, but, after a detailed examination of the numbers- distances, the neutron star's size, orbit time, etc, it was found that it was incorrect. But by adding a zero to the kilometers, it was corrected. So, Niven just dropped a zero, and removed public interest in this fantastical object. So we have a place for floating islands, but no floating islands. And that's where Jupiter's Trojans come in. They are two large clusters of asteroids at Jupiter's L4 and L5 points. These asteroids are numerous, and there are estimated to be around 600,000 asteroids in between 2km and 1km in the L4 group. In the L5 group, there are over 1 million asteroids above 1km in size. Now, we just put these two things together. It is not a world in the strictest sense, but no world seldom is. The main problem is the absence of gravity, but we don't know what happens when someone is born in zero gravity. That means you can make something up for yourself. There is a miniscule amount of gravity on these asteroids, but it's so negligible it could just be called zero gravity. Plants should still be able to grow downwards on their own. They should be extremely tall, but I cannot find anything about that. This should be enough for your world, as anything else would be not be your work. 

No, this will not work. For the heat-electricity concept: What you describe as 'converting waste heat into energy' is the naive explanation of how a thermocouple works. Heat goes in, power comes out. The problem is that thermodynamics tells us it is impossible to reverse entropy, and that means you can't convert heat into useful work. You can use a heat gradient to perform work, which is what a thermocouple actually does, but the process creates even more waste heat in the process. You can hide that heat temporarily by stuffing it into heatsinks, and you can use that heat to generate electricity, but you cannot get rid of heat by using it to generate electricity. Your heatsinks will continue to fill until either you start radiating heat or your ship melts. For the emissions concept: The problem is that you can't interfere with the relevant forms of radiation. Namely, if your ship is emitting the amount of waste heat associated with onboard human life (let alone associated with gigawatt drive systems or anything of the sort), it will be visible as blackbody radiation, the kind that telescopes are routinely designed to detect. And you can't jam a telescope. As explained in this answer to your last question, the only hypothetical way to interfere with this is to spit out a whole lot of additional energy in other wavelengths, but that's neither a means of camouflage nor effective in its own right. 

Question in the title. A Rogue planet is a sunless world that exists in interstellar space. It might be possible for life to develop on one, but what happens when that happens? I've seen people say that plants could not develop on these worlds. But there's the theory of Thermosynthesis, which is almost what I'm looking for. But would it be possible to absorb infrared photons? What is the most efficient color to absorb infrared light? I've heard different things about nonvisible light's albedo, and can find nothing to confirm one way or another. I saw this, and I can see nowhere on it that mentions the color of plants. 

There's a concept that is 100% hard, and is exactly this. It's called Starlifting. Here's a video: $URL$ 

I did the calculations a couple weeks ago. Generation ships are slow and sort of dumb, and will never be used in our grand colonization of the universe. What you need are relativistic ships. With an acceleration of 1.25 Gs(12.25 m/p/s, you can reach Proxima Centauri with a ship-time of about 1126 days, or over 3 years. You can do this for distances as large as you want. Even to Andromeda, without it becoming a generation ship. Here's a handy calculator that I used a lot: $URL$ 

Give each train its own plow High-velocity impacts with lightweight projectiles don't follow the intuitive pattern of a bullet drilling through anything in its way, requiring very thick armor to prevent penetration. Rather, the faster the projectile, and the lighter it is, the more the impact resembles a small explosion. At relativistic speeds, and with individual atoms of interstellar medium, the result is an explosive burst of radiation that does not penetrate no matter how thin the shield is. Mitigating this radiation and sustaining the ablation rate of constant bombardment are the primary concerns. Thus, the plow does not need to be incredibly thick or enormously massive. On a trip to Alpha Centauri (4.4ly) at up to 0.2c, a spacecraft would appear to suffer only half a millimeter of ablation to a quartz shield. The individual particles explode on contact with the shield, blasting out microscopic divots, but not penetrating through to affect the spacecraft behind them. As long as the shield is thick enough to survive ablation over the duration of the journey, it will suffice. At 0.8c, the amount of energy released in each impact will be considerably greater than at 0.2c, but the required shielding still isn't excessive. If the rate of ablation scales linearly with the kinetic energy of collision, this implies around a centimeter of ablation for the 4.4 light-year distance. Each train can be given a shield just a few centimeters thick and slightly larger in diameter than the train itself- there's no need for it to be ten times the size of the train, or for it to be the size of a spacecraft in its own right. A simple, disposable shield made of easily-available materials will suffice, can be recycled and reformed into new shields at the destination, and in the context of interstellar travel is so cheap it's hardly worth accounting for. 

I have a being that does not have vocal cords, and instead, speaks to 3-dimensional beings(humans) by manipulating air to produce what sounds like human speech. What would its voice sound like? 

Thinking outside the box, here. It's entirely possible. The soil could even be normal, Terran soil. The light shining on it could be blue, though. As O-type stars are really rare, and not recommended for life, let's go with a B-type, a blue-white, or light blue star. If you place a planet in orbit of one, you're going to have blue soil. For your color requirement, here's a nice picture of Bellatrix, a example of a B-type star that's 250±10 light years off. Now, would the soil be fertile? The main issue is of how long these stars live. It's not very long. Enough for planets to form, but the star will go nova or supernova before then. You could always terraform one of those molten rocks, or build a megastructure like a shellworld there.
