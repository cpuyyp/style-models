Much heavier people ride various kinds of MTBs that have been reconfigured for riding on the road, and do not experience regular tire problems (blowouts, punctures). You seem to be suggesting that your weight and size is the cause of the tire problems, but that is not consistent with my experience. As suggested by other respondents, you want some good quality slicks or semi-slicks on this bike to improve rolling resistance. You can run some of them at higher pressures than you might run a knobby tire, which also helps. Before you install new tires, be sure that your rim tape/rim strip is not the source of your "blowouts." In other words, once rim tape gets tired, and the adhesive doesn't work as well as it used to, the tape can shift around under the tube, exposing the spoke holes, causing flats. Similarly, if you have an incorrectly sized (too narrow) rim strip, you can have the same problem. Bottom line, be sure your rim tape or rim strip is not uncovering the spoke holes. You did not mention what width of tire you're running on the Marin, but on BikePedia it shows the bike is typically spec'd with something around 26" by 2" so any decent tire around that size should be good. Schwalbe Marathon Plus can be hard to mount, and they can be "tall" for a given size, but they are about as low-maintenance and puncture resistant as you can get. There are a few different SMP tires available for 26" rims: Marathon Plus, 50-559, Black-Reflex, Wire Marathon Plus Tour, 50-559, Reflex, Wired Marathon Plus, 47-559, Black-Reflex, Wire Marathon Plus Tour, 47-559, Reflex, Wired That is what I would suggest, along with some decent-quality tubes. 

Collectively, were you to follow all of their recommendations (regarding chain lube, specific chain, pedal, derailleur pulleys, and so forth), they suggest that these improvements will collectively deliver about a 20 Watt savings, which is pretty significant. But I am not a professional racer, and I ride mainly for fitness, so I don't mind some losses due to drivetrain inefficiencies, and if a particular lube delivered extra chain life, I might consider it, even if it was not as efficient as some. BTW, I'm writing from the U.S., and have no idea what GT85 is. 

That has a link to download it as a GPX file, so you could load that onto a GPS device, or other mapping software as required. 

A cyclocross bike is designed for cyclocross racing. This typically involves riding as quickly as possible around a muddy field. So for a cyclocross bike: 

These are designed for road/touring bikes, so are fairly slim, with a small metal platform. (Not to be confused with the PD-A520, which are one-sided SPD pedals, without a flat platform). Personally I use these, they work pretty well, with either SPD shoes or non-SPD shoes. Weight: 383g (pair) PD-T780 

Whereas a commuter bike is designed more for comfort, and carrying luggage as required. So it may have: 

It is possible to buy a basic new fork for about £20 to £30. eg Raleigh 700C 1 1/8" Threaded Fork from Evans. Or there's a variety of options on Ebay, either new or used. Or some cycling forums have classified sections, so you could post a wanted advert. Though there are several things to check to ensure a replacement fork is compatible: 

You could find a bike shop to fit the replacement fork. It may cost anything between £20 and £50, depends on the shop and just what needs done. Or if you want to replace the fork yourself, you will need several tools. Probably including several spanners, and possibly also headset tools. If you don't have these, you may be able to borrow them from someone. The best option could be a DIY bike workshop, eg the one suggested by Booker. They will have tools you can use, plus they may be able to advise on what you need to do. Depending on how your fork was damaged, its possible that other parts of the bike are broken. So it is worth checking it all carefully. The worst would be if the frame is bent or broken, that would be a lot of cost and work to replace. If the frame is damaged, you may be better off just replacing the whole bike. 

It doesn't take much of a change in the stem length to make a difference. Long story short, I changed my saddle and my bars, and started getting horrible back pain after 40 miles or so. I shortened my stem by 30 mm, and all is well. I can ride 70 miles or more before I start feeling any pains, but back pain is not one of them, typically. If you can't post pics of your bike, measurements would be helpful for you to know. In addition, check your bike vs. a fit calculator like this one. Make sure you're in the range of numbers before you start throwing money at this problem. 

You might want to read this chain survey. See page 44 and onwards. Lately I have been using Dumonde lube on my chain and I have been pretty satisfied. It makes it easy to keep the drive-train clean, but it does require the chain be completely degreased prior to the first application. My experience has been consistent with the review. 

The same retailer offers several different models at a lower cost, including this one with a steel frame. 

A good full-suspension bike will make offroad riding better in two respects: 1) The rear suspension can help keep your rear tire almost glued to the dirt, meaning better traction when needed; 2) The rear suspension can help soak up trail buzz, resulting in greater comfort/less fatigue, especially if you don't have the bod of an elite cyclist with noodle arms and a concave chest. I've ridden a local trail with my 1980's vintage MTB (no suspension) and my recent vintage full-suspension bike (Trek Fuel EX 8) and it is like night and day. The bike weight is roughly the same (they built those first-generation MTBs like tanks), but I can go much faster and more comfortably on my Trek Fuel EX 8, especially when I am descending. The full suspension on the Trek makes it much more controllable and comfortable. I admit that I have been passed by guys on hardtails many times, but I outweigh these guys by a few pounds and I definitely don't have the elite cyclist bod. I'm also older than most of them, judging based on appearance. Those are two factors that none of the other responders to-date have mentioned: age and size/weight. In a nutshell, according to my experience, if you are young and/or thin, you may do just fine with a hardtail. But if you are not young and/or not thin, you would probably find greater enjoyment with a FS bike. Most of the folks that I ride with would qualify as "Clydesdales," meaning they weigh 200 lbs or more. All of the Clydes have FS bikes for offroad riding. 

Well, I tell you: you should think before upgrade your gearing. Ask yourself: Do much declines and inclines? In my experience, you cannot run out of a 3*6 combination on flats or even the meager gradients of elevated corridors in cities. As for if it's possible or not, yes it is. You'll need to change your freewheel, change your derailleur and change your shifters and this will cost you a great deal if you consider how much you actually spent on buying that bike. (Well I did some research, turns out that the upgrades alone will cost you a considerable fraction of the cost of your bike, especially since the country you're living in doesn't have an abundance of upgrade parts.) Also, you might need to get a new chain along with all the other things but it won't be required if you're lucky and you get a similarly spaced cassette. --- 

I've got this issue with my bike: the chain rattles an unusual lot when the bike is subjected to usual shocks during a very usual ride (or when I replicate that myself). Background I've got a 21 speed bike with a Shimano tourney derailleur-shifter set and a KMC chain that's the same as what came with the bike (I also recently installed a KMC missing link, but the issue with the rattling predates that development). The chain rattles and touches other front chainrings when I ride on 2*x combinations (and is very annoying too). -- Does the problem has something to do with the derailleur tension? I observed that when I pulled the derailleur back, the chain was more tense, so this could be a thing. If this is the case, then I would be tweaking the B-tension screw. Or can it be something with the chain length? (Remember: the chains the same that came with the bike and when I measured the gap between 12 links, it came out to be less than 12 inches !) I would really like this issue sorted to make my bike a nicer experience (I've taken up biking after a lag of an year or so and I really intend to keep it up and improve my performance) :) 

A little more information would be helpful. Are you riding a road bike or hybrid, or what? How tall are you? What is your inseam? What size is the bike? Without this information, the best I can do is: 1) 6-7 miles isn't a long ride. If you're getting numbness in such a short distance, something is probably wrong. 2) It could be the fit of your bike. Hands get numb when they carry too much weight. If your bike is not the right size, or if it is set up incorrectly, this may cause you to put too much weight on your hands. 3) It could be your fitness. If your core (abdominal and/or back muscles) are weak, you could be compensating by putting too much weight on your hands. 4) It could be a combination of #2 and #3. What can be done to fix this? It depends on the cause. See if your bike is the right size for your body. Online fit computers can help with this. In addition, consider strengthening your core. If you ride a hybrid, consider some new grips. 

What I've found is that I get back pain when I'm too stretched out. That is, when the reach is too much for me, I get back pain. You can see the measurement I'm referring to in the picture below. 

The Amazon wheel you linked is a solid axle, which means it has bolts (instead of a quick-release), so you'll need to carry a wrench that fits it. If you have a flat and are not carrying a wrench, you'll be walking or finding some other means of transport. Cheap wheels are, to a certain extent, false economy. You'll find they may not stay true for long, because of careless assembly. Spokes can break more frequently. If you're in a position to handle such problems, then no worries. But if you're not able to fix a broken spoke, your savings can quickly evaporate. My local bike shop charges U$D 30.00 each to fix a broken spoke on a rear wheel. While some bicycle wheels can be quite expensive, you want to strike a balance between total crap wheels that achieve false economy, and too-expensive wheels (which may not be optimal for commuting use anyway). You linked two different sizes of wheels, so I don't know what kind you really need. I recently shelled out a few hundred U$D for some new wheels. They were machine made and needed retensioning, which cost another U$D 100 at my LBS, but they are real true now and very, very strong. Had I bought the hubs, spokes, and rims separately, I would have paid even more. I anticipate many thousands of miles of life from them. If you drop decent money on a set of wheels and get 20,000 km from them, I'd say you're better off than if you drop a small amount of money on a wheelset that gets built into a decent one, one broken spoke at a time. 

Shimano Deore XT T8000 is a groupset designed for trekking, touring and commuting bicycles. It is different to the XT for mountain bikes (currently XT M8000). So some bike shops may not sell the whole range of trekking components. 

Mars Bars are not that great for cycling. Yes, they have quite a lot of calories, so will give you some energy. But most of that is simple sugars, so it may be a quick energy boost, but soon followed by an energy crash. Also Mars Bars have quite a lot of fat (about 17g per 100g), so this can not be easily digested while cycling hard - it could just make you sick. Mars Bars are not very practical either. On a warm day, a bar in your back pocket will probably melt, so become rather messy and difficult to eat. 

TCX and FIT are designed for fitness activities, so they can contain more fitness data than GPX. eg TCX or FIT supports laps (splits). So your device could record a new lap whenever you press the lap button, or automatically after a set distance, eg every 1km. Also they support pauses, if you want to stop the activity at one point, then start again later. Whereas GPX is essentially just a series of points (with timestamps). I am not sure whether Strava actually uses the laps or pauses recorded on the device, I suspect it will recalculate them anyway, based on the GPS points and time. As standard, GPX does not support heart rate, cadence or power data. But this can be added with extensions. The most popular format for these extension was created by Garmin, it is also supported by a variety of other software/websites (including Strava). But some devices might record heart rate/cadence in a different format in the GPX file. TCX or FIT can also contain summary data, for the whole activity. eg the total time, distance, calories, device used, type of sport. Some of this is used by Strava, eg to display the device, or automatically select the activity type. TCX and GPX are both XML formats, which can be fairly inefficient in terms of file size. But this does mean they can be easily edited, eg in a text editor. FIT is a binary format, so is much smaller file size, typically about 1/10 of the size. File size is usually not a problem anyway - even if you are recording at 1 point per second, a 3 hour activity would be about 1MB in GPX format. So not really an issue, unless your device has very limited memory, or a slow internet connection for uploading. So in general, you probably won't notice much difference between formats for uploading to Strava. Though TCX or FIT may give you a bit more data. And FIT would be a smaller file size.
