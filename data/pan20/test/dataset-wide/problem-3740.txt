The theory of the natural numbers with addition and $x\mapsto 2^x$ is decidable. One reference is the Cherlin-Point paper "On extensions of Presburger arithmetic". It can be found on Francoise Point's webpage: $URL$ 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

Another spin on this question, that gets around the fact that there are only countably many second order sentences, is to look at categoricity in $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$ where we allow conjunctions of size less that $\kappa$ and second order quantifiers. Hyttinen, Kangas and Vaananen (see $URL$ show that, for suitable cardinals $\kappa$, all models of a complete first order theory $T$ of size $\kappa$ are characterized by and $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$-sentence if and only if $T$ is ``classifiable" in the sense of Shelah's Main-Gap i.e., $T$ is stable, NDOP, shallow, and NOTOP. 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

Both seem fine, but like Lee's book, they don't quite cover all the topics you'd want to have covered. Getting past all the foundation work seems to be quite a lot of work indeed. 

More concretely, are there other cardinality related restrictions one can put on a TVS to obtain decent results, or are such pursuits apparently fruitless? Is any cardinality restriction looser than separability useful? [Note: Model Theory would have a lot to say about this, but I'm looking for additional perspectives as well. In addition, we could ask the same question about other structures, but I'd like to start with something concrete.] 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

It is also stated as Theorem 4.(i), I think, and again on pages 470 and 472 where the reference is given to earlier results. For a recent easy-to-read presentation of the proof, see Theorem 5.1.4 in David Marker's Introduction to Model Theory. 

The answer is negative apparently. It is consistent relative to ZFC that all Aronszajn trees are special and that the club principle holds: $URL$ 

In belated partial response to (A), canonical functions are certainly already defined in the Jech-Shelah paper: A note on canonical functions, where reference is made to the work F. Galvin and A. Hajnal, Inequalities for cardinal powers, Annals of Math. 101 (1975), 491-498. The name "canonical" appears to derive from the property that if they exist, they are unique up to equivalence modulo a club. Below $\aleph_2$, they always exist; at or above, they may or may not. 

More can be said than non-first-order axiomatizability. Since the free group $ \mathbb{Z}^{(\omega)}$ is an $L_{\infty, \omega}$-elementary substructure of the non-$\aleph_{2}$-free group $\mathbb{Z}^{\omega}$, there is no axiomatization of the class of free groups (or of $\aleph_{2}$-free groups) in $L_{\infty, \omega}$. If large cardinals exist, the outcome is very different. Mekler proved that if there is a strongly compact cardinal $\kappa$, then the class of free abelian groups is definable in $L_{\infty, \infty}$ (and in $L_{\kappa, \kappa}$ in fact). Furthermore, if the class of free abelian groups is definable in $L_{\infty, \infty}$, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. 

There is also Shelah's very enjoyable construction using descending sequences of infinite subsets of $\omega$, close in spirit to Aronszajn's tree of rational sequences, and described in Judith Roitman's book here: $URL$ 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

This was surprising because before that point I had considered the two sides of a coproduct to be reversible, but they can no longer be considered so if the first set is designated as the collection of "normal" outputs and the second set is designated as paramaterizing an "exceptional" result. My question: are there other places where an function/arrow to a coproduct is viewed as an alternative between a normal/regular outcome on one side and an exceptional/irregular outcome on the other? Though I can't think of many right now, I'm guessing there must be computations (etc) where coproducts have an asymmetric normal vs irregular interpretation. 

First, some setup: So: given a commutative ring $R$, let $Ideals(R)$ be set of ideals of $R$ and let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of closure operations $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow Ideals(R)$. In other words, let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of functions $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(R)$ such that 

Given a topological vector space $V$, let its density be the smallest cardinal $A$ such that a set of cardinality $A$ is dense in $V$. Naively, it seems one of two things happen: 

TVS's $V$ of larger and larger cardinality become more and more pathological / difficult / intractable or, There is a cardinal $A_{max}$ so that almost all pathological behavior exhibited in any TVS is exhibited in a TVS of density $A$ less than or equal to $A_{max}$. 

Does such a book exist? Perhaps a second volume such as "Topics in Smooth Manifolds" by John M. Lee would do. Alternatives to consider:
