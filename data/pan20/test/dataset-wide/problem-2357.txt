How about if you just take photos and post them on mountainproject or summitpost, along with verbal descriptions and UTM coordinates? Physically marking the starts of the routes is not compatible with a leave-no-trace ethic. 

The options you're proposing are VFFs or hiking boots. There are lots of other options. What I use most of the time here in California is running shoes. They work great when conditions aren't snowy or wet. The weight is much less than the weight of hiking boots, but if I step on a sharp-edged rock, I have more protection than I'd have with VFFs. I use lightweight gaiters (Dirty Girl brand -- google it) to keep pebbles out. In certain conditions, sandals such as Cachos can be extremely comfortable. However, in certain conditions (e.g., powdery dust), they can be miserable. Where are you used to hiking? Are the conditions there comparable to Scotland (which could be wet)? If they're comparable, use what your feet are used to. GoreTex hiking boots are great when you're hiking through a lot of mud or snow. Other than that, there isn't much reason to put all that weight on your feet, and the weight will just decrease your efficiency. However, the number of miles you're planning to hike is very low, so efficiency may not be an issue. 

I've been working on improving my self-rescue skills, but the skills I've learned so far seem to pertain mostly to single-pitch climbing. For example, a lot of people emphasize knowing how to escape a belay, which is fine, but that seems to be mostly applicable to the situation where you're giving someone a belay from below on a single-pitch climb, you can't just lower them (maybe because they'd end up on a ledge), and you need to run and get help. If you're in the middle of a multi-pitch climb, it seems like it escaping the belay may not be relevant, or may at best be only part of the solution. I'm sure there are many different possible self-rescue situations that could come up in multipitch trad. But one likely-seeming situation I can come up with is that I'm giving someone a lead belay, he gets injured too badly to be able to up- or downclimb, and we have more than half the rope out, so I can't just lower him all the way. What do you do in this situation? My best guess would be to lower him down to the lowest piece of protection I can get him to, escape the belay, ascend the rope, improve that piece of pro to a solid anchor, secure him to the anchor, and free the rope from the gear higher up (either by climbing and cleaning, or by untying and pulling the rope through). Then maybe clip him in to the rope with a locking biner, lower him to the belay station, have him unclip, and then rap down to the belay station myself (possibly leaving a lot of gear). Wow, this seems complicated and difficult, especially if I can't see the situation clearly from the belay station. I think a solution to this problem would also pretty much apply to single-pitch climbing in an area where it's not possible to run and get help, e.g., because you're in a remote area. Question: what would be some general strategies for dealing with this type of situation? 

I have a pair of microspikes, and have a friend who has owned both microspikes and yaktrax. The impression I get is that yaktrax are meant for walking around town on sidewalks covered with snow and ice, whereas microspikes are more for trails and steep terrain. Microspikes have spikes, yaktrax don't. Because of that, yaktrax give much poorer traction on ice, but you can walk into a shop without taking them off. Microspikes are more like mini-crampons, and the situation where they're really great is if you're hiking across a landscape where there's a mixture of rocks, ice, snow, and dirt. Crampons are not well suited to these mixed conditions. Microspikes are also more compact and lightweight than crampons, and unlike crampons they're compatible with any kind of shoe. I've used microspikes plus an ice ax in situations where other people were using crampons plus an ice ax, and although I would have felt safer with crampons, they were better than nothing. 

No, not at 10,000', if "worried" means worried about dying. Of course, if you feel lousy, you feel lousy. You're not having fun. That could be a good reason to reconsider your options, such as turning around or waiting somewhere while your companions summit and then pick you up on the way back. 

Big, heavy "waffle stomper" boots are mainly a relic of the past, along with wool knickers and steel canteens. For most conditions, modern running shoes work far better. Any weight on your feet cuts down on your efficiency much more than a similar amount of weight on your back. Also, the heavier your boots get, the harder it is to keep from getting blisters, regardless of how hard you try to get the right fit. If you find it a nuisance to have pebbles always getting inside your low-cut running shoes, there are lightweight trail gaiters these days that you attach using velcro and a hook. (I buy them from dirtygirlgaiters.com.) For people like me who have wide feet, it tends to be easier to find running shoes that fit properly; in particular, nobody seems to make crampon-compatible boots in wide sizes. Boots are better in certain specific conditions: 

Factors you can't easily control Some factors that you can't easily control play a clear role. These include genetics, being overweight,[Theisen] or having a previous injury. For example, people who want to lose weight may run in order to burn calories; they can't necessarily lose the weight before they start running so as to reduce their chance of getting hurt. Changes in what you do There is a large amount of consistent evidence that people get injured more frequently when they make a change in their activity. This could mean changing from stretching to not stretching, changing from not stretching to stretching, wearing different shoes, or running at a different pace or for a different distance.[Pereles,Reynolds] Stretching and warming up In general, scientific evidence doesn't support the common belief that stretching before playing sports prevents injuries.[McHugh] Of course this depends somewhat on the sport. In the case of running, a pre-run stretch has been found in a randomized trial to have no statistically significant effect on the incidence of injuries.[Pereles] Cushioning of shoes A number of studies have attempted to test whether shoes with more cushioning prevent injury. The results have not always been consistent, but in general there is no clear evidence that cushioning prevents injury.[Theisen] Barefoot runners and runners who use minimalist shoes do not have higher rates of injury, but switching from one type of shoe to another may cause problems; as with any change in what you do, it increases your risk of injury. Running shoe companies have been telling runners for a long time that they need different shoes depending on whether their feet are normal, pronated, or supinated. This is not true.[Nielsen2] Repetitive stress injuries Most running injuries are repetitive stress injuries, or RSI's. As you run, you may be doing tiny amounts of invisible damage to various parts of your body. Normally this damage just heals up and you never even feel it. But if the long-term rate at which you do the damage to a certain body part outpaces the rate at which your body can heal it, your condition will gradually get worse. As suggested by the term, RSI's are thought to be caused by a stress or load, such as tension or compression, placed on your musculoskeletal system. Most materials behave elastically when subjected to a certain amount of stress, so that when the stress is released, then go back to their original shape. Think of a rubber band being placed under tension, which is then released. But there is a limit on the amount of stress, called the elastic limit. Beyond this limit, the rubber band may be damaged. When it comes to RSI's caused by running, there has been a lot of speculation that the really damaging stresses are the ones from impacts, such as the heel strike seen in the style of running used by most people who grow up in the industrialized world wearing shoes. The evidence seems to show that what's correlated the most with injuries is not the amount of force (load) experienced by your body parts but the rate of change of the force, which is called the load rate or impact loading.[Zadpoor][Davis] For example, if three people are piled on top of you, lying quietly, then your body is feeling a force equal to four times the usual force of gravity, but the force is not changing, so the load rate is zero. Measurements seem to show that when people wear running shoes, the load rate from their heel strikes is higher than the load rate experienced by barefoot runners.[Lieberman] Unlike load rate, load itself doesn't seem to be correlated with injury.[Davis] In fact, impact is good for you. Your body seems to need some good hard impacts (about 4 gees or more) in order to have healthy bone density.[Tobias] This is an example of what's known as the "training effect," which is that when you do an activity that results in a certain optimal load, your body gets stronger. However, there is a higher level of load, called the "abusive load," that causes injury. So the evidence seems to be that you should subject your body to impacts that are of just the right strength, and that they should be applied with a low load rate. Volume and pace This makes it pretty complicated to interpret medical studies of running injuries, because usually there is no detailed information about the load and load rate. One hypothesis[Nielsen] is that there are four different variables that should be studied:
