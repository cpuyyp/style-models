As said in the comments, there is an important difference between household income and wages. Household income includes income from capital. As a higher share of total income is going to capital than to labour (see below), you would expect a divergence between household and wages. 

Since you are interested in labour, let's assume for simplicity that the stock of capital is fixed at $\bar{K}$. Then, the optimal choice of capital and labour is given by: $$\frac{L^*}{a}=\frac{\bar{K}}{b}$$ Therefore, optimal labour is: $$L^* = \frac{a}{b}\bar{K}$$ The marginal product of labour depends on how actual labour relates to optimal labour: 

The example by @CWill is correct in an exchange economy (explore more of it here), but does not apply to a production economy. As David Ricardo explained, the only condition needed for exchange is the existence of comparative advantage. This is when say group A is relatively more productive in the production of one good than another group B. Then, group A will specialise in the production of that good, whilst group B will specialise in the other good. Trade will expand the overall production possibility frontier, which means consumers in both groups will see an expansion in their consumption possibilities. Thus, through trade, they can both consume more. Importantly, this is independent of any different in consumption (actually, trade still occurs if preferences are identical). The role of preferences is to determine the relative prices of the goods. Notice that one reason why a group might have comparative advantage is relative abundance. For instance, one country might have a sea with so many fish that, even if using a net of the same size than another group, the output of such fishing will be very high. In this case, relative productivity is different between groups; comparative advantage exists. Another nice example is that of Robinson Crusoe's economy. 

Therefore, if I were to model AI, I would do so as part of TFP, and not as a new factor of production. In my view, the report is highlighting is that AI is a different and new component of TFP, one which could revitalise growth. 

Regarding your question before the update: 1) Yes, they have the same units ("how many units of CNY you need to buy one USD", either directly or through a bitcoin intermediary). That is the whole point of arbitrage. 2) It seems that "the global forex market" and "the bitcoin market" seem separate to you. If by the former you mean big investment banks, then maybe you are right, as there seem to be no indication that big investment banks are systematically engaging in Bitcoin trading (at least I found no evidence of it; please correct me if I'm wrong). However, there are tons of bitcoin-oriented banks and brokers doing transactions on currency pairs, and I'm not sure these should not be counted as part of the global forex market. Having said this, I think the simplest interpretation of the lines is that of a currency pair, and that of the currency pair being arbitraged through bitcoin. 3) The green line refers to how many units of CNY you need to buy one unit of USD. Or equivalently, how many units of CNY you get for one unit of USD. If the purple line is above (below) the green line, then you can get more (less) units of CNY by (1) selling USD through bitcoin and (2) buying CNY with those bitcoins. This means your interpretation in the update is correct. If you have USD, sell them to BTC, and buy CNY (purple line), and then exchange these directly to USD. As the green line is below the purple one, you need less CNY to buy one USD, which is the same to say that you get more USD for the same amount of CNY. So, there seem to be arbitrage opportunities, at least in a zero transaction cost market. 

According to Vela Velupillai, Orthodox Economic Theory is not Turing Complete, because it is "replete with uncomputabilites". On this 2009's article he states: 

Official forecasts seem not to be available. The Bureau of Economic Analysis did produce these forecast in the past, but not anymore. Forecasts from academic economists are scarce. US studies are usually only available for employment and not for GDP (for example, this paper). A working paper from late 2014 reviews the literature on regional forecasting (not only for the US) and the state-of-the-art methodology of such exercises. You can see in Table 1 a summary of studies between 1975 and 2015. None of them focuses on GDP for US states. Notice however that there are such studies for Germany (Wenzel, 2013) and Europe (Baltagi et. al. 2014), so maybe in the future an equivalent for the US will be produced. 

(Report here). Conclusion As you can see, ILO puts Czech Republic, Greece, Argentina, and Chile as developed countries, whereas Citi puts them as emerging countries (Argentina as emerging can be seen in other reports). (ILO even distinguishes between emerging and developing). This shows that there is no hard-coded rule about classification of countries. It all depends on the institution. 

According to Eric Beinhocker, complexity economics is built upon very old contributions, including Mathus, Darwin, Marshall, Schumpeter, and Hayek, to name a few. It is inspired by Biology (and Evolutionary Biology in particular), but also by physics. There is a discipline related to the latter and many times associated with Complexity ideas, called Econophysics. In terms of Institutions, the main precursor of this school of thought, and still central today in its development, is the Santa Fe Institute, in the U.S. 

You can only judge returns to scale by a simultaneous change in all inputs. Thus, in this case, if you want to test returns to scale, you have to use one of the first three rows and the last row as references. So, by the definition of returns to scale, you can see that doubling the factors (this is, a move from top row to bottom row) doubles the output. Therefore, it must be the case that there are constant returns to scale. The other two rows only show that labour is productive. This is, that it's marginal product is positive. 

Perhaps not entirely pertinent to the case of parking, this entry in The Economist claims that early-bird tickets are useful in events like concerts to build up a minimum mass of goers: 

There is the row Observations, and the row Countries. The latter is the unit of analysis. As the data is a longitudinal panel, there are multiple observations per country. As the panel is unbalanced, the number of observations is generally not a multiple of the number of countries (e.g. for Pooled OLS (column 1), $945/150=6.3$). 

Microsimulation: this requires to have a general equilibrium model where a population of (commonly) households are simulated, usually to analyse policy changes. For the case of China, an example is here. This is the best approach in terms of using economic theory, but it is very time-consuming. Regression: here you estimate a regression to evaluate determinants of nation-wide inequality. Included in these determinants should be the rate of urban and rural poverty. Forecasting them (and other regressors) you can forecast future Gini. This method is a highly reduced-form approach and might be highly inaccurate or inconsistent (due to endogeneity, etc). Still, to get an idea, see this paper. Percentile income growth: as suggested by ahorn, you could go atheoretical and simply predict income growth of each percentile. Then you can easily compute Gini. The plot of these percentile income growth are commonly known as "growth incidence curve". For an example on China see here (Figure 4). 

What if we went to China and said, "Instead of us paying you 600m USD in full for your goods, how about we just give you a piece of paper that entitles you at some point in the future to come take some of our US goods? Say, \$1 worth of US goods." That sounds like debt to me. But that paper is the same thing as a $1 bill. This is one sense in which you could think of the trade deficit as representing actual indebtitude. (Originally a comment from @NickJ) 

A context where the PPF is usually found is in a 2x2 model, where there are two sectors or goods ($x$ and $y$) and two factors of production ($K$ and $L$). The shape of the PPF depends on the relative intensities in which each sector/good uses those factors. For example, assume each sector $j$ has a CRS production function $F_j(K_j,L_j)$, with different technological parameters. Let us also assume a fixed endowment of factors of production, complete factor mobility across sectors, and competitive markets, such that payment of factors of production freely adjust in order to allocate factors into sectors. Also, assume the price of the goods fixed, e.g. as if the economy is small and open to international markets. For a given set of relative factor prices, $r/w$, common to both sectors, optimal relative factors in each sector are given by: $$ \dfrac{\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial K_x}}{\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial L_x}} = \frac{r}{w} = \dfrac{\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial K_y}}{\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial L_y}} $$ The first fraction above is a function of $\frac{K_x}{L_x}$, whereas the last fraction is a function of $\frac{K_y}{L_y}$. Since by definition $L_x+L_y=L$ and $K_x+K_y=K$, we have a system of three equations with four unknowns. This means that we can reduce the system to one equation with two unknowns. Whether this equation yields a closed form solution for on variable in terms of the other (e.g. $L_x=f(K_x$) depends on the functional form of $F_j$. Apparently, this is possible only in the case of trivial production functions like Cobb-Douglas or Leontief (for an example of the former, see here). Assuming we can find such equation $L_x=f(K_x$), the algebraic solution to the PPF follows immediately. This is because you have reduced all four endowment variable sin terms of just one (for instance, $K_x$). Therefore, to find the PPF you can evaluate $F_x$ and $F_y$ for every possible value of $K_x$, and draw the map. Alternatively, you can solve the homogeneous equation $x-F_x(K_x)=0$ for $K_x$ as a function of $x$, and then replace this $K_x^*(x)$ into $F_y$, from where you get $y=f(x)$, having in mind the restrictions on the variable space (i.e. $x,y>0$). Notice again that solving the above homogeneous equation is not always possible. For an example where it is possible, see link above. The PPF might look like: 

The author is referring to "old" political theories of inflation. I have struggled to find references about them. I wonder if someone has come across some of these political theories of inflation? 

Albeit many economists contributed to the emergence of this school of thought (particularly the "marginalists" William Stanley Jevons, Leon Walras, and Carl Menger), the father of neoclassical economics is Alfred Marshall. In his famous and widely used book "Principles of Economics", published in 1890, he provided a systematic and rigorous treatment to now-common topics like "elasticity, consumer surplus, increasing and diminishing returns, short and long terms, and marginal utility". He was also the first to use the demand and supply graph: 

I do not know where you got the forecasts for GDP, but it is very likely they do not include a forecast on how PPPs are changing. As such, a computation of the rate of growth of GDP in 2005 PPP is a mreasure of real GDP growth. Hence, what you want to do is to concatenate two series. For this, take the latest GDP level of each country from the World Bank series in 2011 prices, and extend it using the forecasted GDP growth rates in 2005 prices, calculated from your database of forecast. Naturally you only want to forecast GDP for the years that are missing in the World Bank database. The reliability of this exercise depends on how outdated the forecasts from the 2005 database are. 

In that same report you find other goods/services which are not included in that category, like house rent, government college and university fee, restaurants, alcoholic beverages and tobacco, etc. I think this categorisation is rather arbitrary, and as I said, might only be used in Pakistan. In any case, if you want to give school children a rough idea, I would summarise it as "things for which people pay day after day, including food like rice, milk, tea (etc), or mobilisation like bus tickets, kerosene oil (etc), and it does not include things for which people pay only occasionally, like restaurants and college fee". Given the information I've given above, you can come up with a better phrase, more suitable for your (and school children's) context. 

The last payment of these loans by the UK government was done in 2006. Apparently, the last payment from the French occured in 1962. 

Although this is not a primary source (as ONS), they have the potential benefit of being comparable across countries (all in USD). The drawback is that they are not in GBP. This only matter is the GBP/USD has varied considerable over time, which it has:
