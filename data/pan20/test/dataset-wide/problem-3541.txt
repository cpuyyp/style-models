I yanked an adductor the other day. Just speaking from my own experience, it played out a little like this: 

There's a 2005 study, and plenty of others, that show a clear dopamine release when sugar is ingested. This one shows that (in rats) it's on par with addictive narcotics. 

Hormones get over simplified sometimes. The broscience would go something like this: "If you want to get bigger, inject testosterone. If you want to get skinnier, inject leptin." The reality is that your endocrine system is way more complicated than that, and leptin is a good example. This is an excerpt from Dr Richard Atkinson (endocrinologist): 

Your muscles will be more defined if you have less body fat covering them up. Muscles are built by protein and amino acid structures, fat has a role to play in nutrition but it lacks the ability (amino acids) to construct or repair muscle tissues. 

Overall body heat. I want to break a sweat no matter what I'm doing. I want to ensure that I'm specifically warming up the muscles that I'm about to use. It's a little silly to use a bicycle to warmup for bench pressing. It's better than nothing, but a big reason that people love rowing machines is because it's a fairly decent head-to-toe recruitment activity. It's also hard and uncomfortable, which is probably why most people don't do it. 

Certain types of activity, particularly lengthening (eccentric), are much more likely to cause DOMS. DOMS is also more likely to be caused by new exercises and new load. On the supplementation side, L-Glutatmine has been shown to reduce the severity of DOMS (but not eliminate it). One last note is that DOMS is not a good indicator of your workout. As an example, isometric muscle movements are unlikely to cause DOMS, and nearly all heavy back lifts train the lower back muscles isometrically (like the deadlift). Dumbbell flies will give almost anyone DOMS, and deadlifts will probably not give you much in your back: that doesn't mean that dumbbell flies are better than deadlifts because they make you more sore. 

A caveat to the ab wheel is that it actually takes a pretty fit person to safely use it. If you can hold a plank for a minute or so, I think you're in a good spot. It can be a lot of load on wrists, shoulders, and your abs. Used incorrectly, it can put a lot of load on your lower back as well. 

Summed up, you get different results from different speeds and sometimes it's determined by the lift itself. 

Just to provide some background, lightning is a real problem and causes a lot of casualties. From Medicine for Mountaineering, 6th Edition: 

Dizziness in training can come from a variety of factors. Most everyone who's lifted very heavy doing compound barbell lifts has felt a little woozy after a few reps of heavy weights, and you'll hear a lot of endurance athletes talking about "almost passing out". But real fainting (syncope) in exercise is serious: 

Cancers are too numerous to make sweeping statements about, but the National Cancer Institute has demonstrable evidence of exercise playing a significant role in reducing multiple cancer risks. Diabetes is clearly reduced by nutrition and exercise, and half of "accident deaths" are from falls, many of which in the elderly although perhaps not fatal start a chain reaction of events through broken hips and then lack of physical movement. Increasing balance and coordination reduces falls, and this has been demonstrated with fitness as well (2006 study): 

Ketosis is legimate, effective, and safe way to cut down on body fat. There are examples of native people who historically ate very little carbohydrates for generations. Most of the sinister cheap calories in a western diet come from carbohydrates. Even following a "low carbohydrate diet" still has you ingesting more than you probably want to. 

If you're talking about reducing belly fat, you should read up that spot reduction is a myth: you can't target fat on any part of your body. But directly answering your question the smallest piece of equipment I know of for abdominals is the ab wheel: 

Lyle McDonald wrote a while back that he doesn't feel carbohydrates are necessary at all, because glycogen can be provided by fat and protein. From the article: 

Your reliance on "going for some runs at night" makes me think you're not focusing on diet and nutrition. Track your calories, drop most of the carbs, stength train, get a physical sport/hobby, and up the protein. It's a lot of life modifications but it's the only long term path I know of that works. Welcome to getting older. 

For planks and bridges, I try to squeeze my butt really tight and get prepared for a sucker punch to the stomach. Your "core" is everything south of your pecs to north of your knees. I've always found "core" to be a silly term, but it does make people think of the oft forgotten muscles that we're talking about here. That position, where you are literally stiff as a board, is the same you will generally want to hold in a pushup, at the top of a deadlift, and numerous other positions requiring a tight mid section. 

No. You most likely have far more energy than your body needs to get through the day and possibly through the next month or two, just in fat and sugar (and to a lesser extend muscle) reserves. If you were a 4% body fat hunter gatherer living 300K years ago then yes, you really would want to ensure that you're sucking down every calorie you can get your hands on and never want to pass up a meal. Unfortunately, we share the same biology of our ancestors and food marketing companies know how to work with this. 

2.5. Also in a group setting you'll benefit from drafting, where you'll be riding in the wind shadow of people ahead of you, getting you more comfortable with speed. 

I don't think the weight is very relevant. Answering your question directly, the goal for carboloading is to ensure that you have sufficient glycogen for your event. Running 3.1 miles at ~6-minute-miles would take something like ~700 calories (depending heavily on a variety of factors such as your body weight, training, the terrain, etc). So having 2,000 calories stored might be a bit overkill, but to get to that number you'd need to do depletion in advance and eat lot of lower-GI foods. 

I hate answering with a question, but you really should have a solid answer to what are your goals? In short, you want to stress your system enough to cause adaptation. The four cycles go: 

Summary The study on the monkeys did not show a reduction in the primary (or even secondary) causes of death in humans. As such I think it's quite a leap to think it applies to humans in any material way as the challenges to our mortality are fundamentally different than that of a monkey. 

This really is a cosmetic question and nothing related to fitness, but I did some checking in on it before I dismissed it out of hand. It turns out that your friend is somewhat right based on January 2014 study. 

The diagram above is from the study, and basically shows that at a cellular level you retain a lot of your gains even going on for years. A follow up article took it a bit further and expanded on the last sentence in the study's abstract: 

These questions are tough because they're essentially "how long is a piece of string" type guesses. You're going to start seeing improvement slowly but surely, and eventually you'll get decreasing gains where changing a few degrees will take a much longer amount of time. Good on you for doing bent over rows and deadlifts (really terrific exercises), but rather than going at it from a physical therapy prospective I'd really recommend a proper and balanced strength training routine. Make sure you're doing some standing overhead press work, dips, and flat or incline bench pressing as well. Even pushups would be better than nothing in that department. You got into this predicament by being out of balance in the first place, so trying to out-smart your body's preferred state of affairs might seem like a great idea but it's not going to work well in the long run. 

Two things to consider would be deadlifts and barbell rows. Done correctly there's not much movement in your wrist for those, and the deadlift will train your biceps isometrically while the barbell row will do concentric. It's a little soap-box-y, but I'd add that except for a very small portion of bodybuilders, most everyone would be much better off doing compound barbell lifts. Targeting individual muscles in isolation (curls, skull crushers, etc) are a great way to build imbalances and tendinitis. So, while you may feel dismayed that you can't curl, you're probably better off anyway. 

There are other advantages, but clearly those alone are enough to show the importance of being "heat acclimated". Losing electrolytes wreaks mayhem throughout your body, affecting cellular activity when it's needed most. Slower thermal regulation causes your temperature to flare up, exacerbating the issue. And hyperthermia triggers vasoconstriction which reduces blood flow to skeletal muscles, your heart, your lungs, and every cell in your body. 14 days is the generally accepted period of heat acclimation, with the first 3-5 being quite important in their own right. It's been noted that there is a difference in adaptation between high and low humidity environments as well, pertaining to heat. A reality of athletics is that you need to train for the event's conditions. I live at 8,000 feet and we have plenty of trails and lakes above 10,000 feet so high altitude training is just how we live. When people from sea level come up here they are severely impacted, and there's just no way to train hard enough to combat that other than real altitude acclimating. Similar to the biological changes from heat acclimation, altitude includes the increased production of EPO, a hormone that triggers red blood cell production. At 10,000 feet, after acclimating, you will simply have more red blood cells. I bring it up to make it clear that you really cannot train hard enough at sea level, or in a cold environment in your case, to makeup for the biology. You'll need to ask yourself how important any given race is to you, and knowing conditions like altitude and temperature, are you going to put yourself on even footing with the folks conditioned to those environments? 

What I would add to that though is that the reasoning espoused by most lifters (and most vocally Mark Rippetoe) isn't necessarily about force production but rather spinal protection. Here's a decent video from Ripppetoe explaining his views on it. Basically, by filling the lungs and tightening the diapgram and abdominal muscles, you're bracing the lumbar and thoracic spine, providing less opportunity for it to shift and get damaged. This is not a concern for the strength loads involved in a "weight loss and wellness" camp, but it certainly is for strength athletes. 

Your mother is in a seriously dangerous place, and this really is in the realm of nutrition and medicine more than physical fitness (as far as priorities go). Her endocrine, cardiovascular, muscular, and skeletal systems have to be off-the-charts bad. There's a good movie that came out recently called Fed Up: it lays out a lot of the more horrible aspects of western diets that contribute to obesity and diabetes. You may want to sit down and watch it with her. She has some incredible distance between a healthy diet and where she is now, and honestly a physician should really be involved to help manage that weight loss. She's very likely a clear candidate for weight loss surgery, and a physician friend of mine has told me of cases of extreme obesity (which your mother has) where removing the weight needs to be carefully tracked. It's really not out of line to make the clear case that her life is quite literally at stake. People that are ~400 pounds overweight don't last very long and her quality of life has to be extremely compromised at this point. On a personal note, the embarrassment you feel at the idea of your mother attending your graduation is understandable. A sobering aspect of growing up is that you need to care for the people who once cared for you. If you can imagine how heart broken you would be to hear your mother say that she was embarrassed for you to be somewhere with her, I'm sure it would hurt her likewise. Focus on helping her. Talk to her doctor, get the point across to other family members: you don't have a lot of time. 

It's a bit of a viscous cycle because eating simple carbohydrates (bread, rice, sugar, flour, etc) produces insulin which makes the food taste better and makes you hungrier. Insulin is also an anabolic hormone that provides for fat storage. 

I've had this before and although I'm a little cautious to throw the overtraining flag, research suggests there is correlation if not causation:
