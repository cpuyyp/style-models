As the solar time Wikipedia page illustrates, we can split a solar day into a constant 23h56m to complete a rotation relative to the stars (a sidereal day) and a variable ~4m to compensate for one day's orbital motion around the Sun. The Sun's apparent motion around the equator determines how much more than 360$^\circ$ the Earth must rotate from one solar noon to the next. But the Earth orbits the Sun in the ecliptic plane, which is oblique to the equator. If that orbit were circular, the Sun's ecliptic longitude would change at a constant rate (see Note below). One degree along the equator spans exactly 4m00s of right ascension; one degree along the ecliptic, measured around the equator, may span ~8% more or less than that. At an equinox, the ecliptic crosses the equator at a 23.4$^\circ$ angle, and one degree of ecliptic longitude spans 3m40s of right ascension. The Sun appears to move slower than average around the equator, so the apparent solar day is slightly shorter. At a solstice, the ecliptic is tangent to a $\pm$23.4$^\circ$ declination parallel, and one degree of ecliptic longitude spans 4m22s of right ascension. The Sun appears to move faster than average around the equator, so the apparent solar day is slightly longer. 

A group at LLNL have worked on it with DARPA funding. They had a folding glass system called Eyeglass in 2003 and a flexible membrane system called MOIRE in 2013. They embraced the diffraction and put it to work, totally unlike refractive optics as we know them. 

(1) By the law of universal gravitation, All satellites MUST orbit around the centre of the earth. The plane of the Tropic of Cancer does not pass through the earth's centre and therefore cannot be the orbital plane for ANY satellite. (2) Since geostationary satellites must be located directly over the equator, their footprint does not extend to extreme North and South latitudes. To overcome this, an extremely eccentric orbital pattern called a Molniya orbit is used by countries like Russia (extreme North latitudes). The orbit is designed so that when the satellite is over Russian cities, the satellite is moving very slowly (in accordance with Kepler's second law) and remains "visible" to radio receivers for maximum time. 

By latitude and longitude of the sun, I think you mean latitude and longitude of a point on the earth's surface where the rays of the sun fall perpendicular to the surface. In astronavigation, this point is called the Geographical Position (GP) of the sun and terminology to describe this point is slightly different:- Latitude of the GP is called Declination, and it is numerically equal to what one might call "Latitude". It is measured in degrees North or South the equator. Longitude of the GP is called Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA). Just like longitude, GHA is measured East or West of Greenwich Meridian. Describing the sun's position in this way is called the Equatorial Coordinate System. The wikipedia page you have used gives the additional formulae below to convert from Ecliptic Coordinates (the steps you followed) to Equatorial Coordinates. 

An Earth-crossing asteroid has either an aphelion larger than Earth's perihelion ($Q \gt q_\oplus$, 0.983 AU), or a perihelion smaller than Earth's aphelion ($q < Q_\oplus$, 1.017 AU). For those which have both, the semimajor axis $a$ determines whether it is an Aten or an Apollo - subject to change by a close encounter with Earth. This Minor Planet Center blog post is consistent with the JPL table. I think the diagram used the wrong inequality for Aten aphelia. 

HEASARC keeps a list of FITS viewers. Maybe one of those will meet your requirements. Of course capabilities and usability vary widely. fv did enough to help me answer another question here. The TESS Science Data Products Description Document gives a one-line description of each of their FITS header fields. If Wikipedia and exploratory testing don't close the gaps, ask again here. 

Those two comets happen to have large orbital inclinations to the Ecliptic: 117$^\circ$ for C/1858 L1 (Donati) and 162$^\circ$ for 1P/Halley. Long-period comet orbits are oriented essentially at random, suggesting that they originate in the Oort cloud, a sphere several thousand AU from the Sun. Many short-period comet orbits are inclined only a few degrees to the Ecliptic, suggesting origins in the scattered disc, a torus several tens to a few hundred AU from the Sun. 

A photograph of stars is essentially a gnomonic projection of part of the celestial sphere. If $\vec P$ is computed for the photograph center (RA, Dec) in the same way as $\vec S$, and the north celestial pole is $\hat{\mathrm k} = (0, 0, 1)^{\mathrm T}$, then the photograph has basis vectors perpendicular to $\vec P$ and each other, $$\hat{\mathrm u} = \frac{\vec P \times \hat{\mathrm k}}{\| \vec P \times \hat{\mathrm k} \|}, \hat{\mathrm v} = \frac{\hat{\mathrm u} \times \vec P}{\| \hat{\mathrm u} \times \vec P \|}$$ and you can project $\vec S$ onto the photograph as $$\left( \frac{\vec S \cdot \hat{\mathrm u}}{\vec S \cdot \vec P}, \frac{\vec S \cdot \hat{\mathrm v}}{\vec S \cdot \vec P} \right)$$ scaling as needed. 

So because of what I have described - light being emitted in all possible directions from all over the Sun's surface - we do see light from all parts of the surface. And that light does reach our eyes directly. 

That's meaningless. All light is electromagnetic radiation. A finite part of the infinitely large range of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light. So you should talk about EM radiation and to discuss the visible spectrum just say visible spectrum. Stars emit lots of energy at frequencies that are outside the visible range. 

There's a minimum size for the formation of a black hole by gravitational collapse of a star and it's larger than our Sun's mass. There is, however, no theoretical minimum for the size of a black hole if you can make one some other way. 

An ellipse does indeed have two foci, but the orbits of planets and the motion of the Sun are not quite ellipses anyway. But even if we ignore these small deviations from an ellipse, each planet's orbit is in a different orientation and has different foci. 

Given that we have very few examples, we could not, statistically, draw any significance from any apparent bias. It's also hard to see any theoretical basis for expecting a bias, so my gut feeling would be there probably is no bias. It's also worth remembering that human observations of these things are essentially a very brief snapshot in a huge period during which we have no idea about what may have been happening. So again the statistical significance of what happens at the moment needs to be carefully considered. 

Gaia data release 1 was announced in September 2016. It has parallaxes for 2 million stars previously observed by the Hipparcos mission, a small fraction of the 1.1 billion positions recorded so far. Future releases will of course have more data and smaller errors. Gaia has ~600 light curves for Cepheids but probably not parallaxes for most of those. Casertano et al. 2016 checked Gaia parallax data of some Cepheids against expected values from ground-based photometry. 

The NOAA formula sheet expresses some quantities in radians, some in degrees, and some in minutes of time. It does say which is which, but it's easy to miss. A few minor code changes can help expose bugs: 

If you use the 100cm FL convex lens as an objective and the 20cm FL concave lens as an eyepiece, the telescope will have only 5x magnification but otherwise be similar to the one Galileo used to discover the four largest moons of Jupiter. Here is documentation of such a telescope built by students. Beyond 10x or so, you need a steady mount for the telescope, and simple lenses may show chromatic aberration. 

In other words, at what hour angle $h$ is the Sun's azimuth $\mathtt{Az}_s$ at a right angle to the wall's normal vector (84$^\circ$ or 264$^\circ$)? Using these formulas, which I've checked, from Wikipedia: Solar azimuth angle, $$\sin \phi_s = \frac{-\sin h \cos \delta}{\sin \theta_s} \\ \cos \phi_s = \frac{\sin \delta \cos \Phi - \cos h \cos \delta \sin \Phi}{\sin \theta_s}$$ where $\phi_s$ is the Sun's north-clockwise azimuth, $\theta_s$ is the Sun's zenith angle (90$^\circ$ - $\mathtt{Alt}_s$), $\delta$ is the Sun's declination, and $\Phi$ is your geographic latitude. Then $\tan \phi_s = \sin \phi_s / \cos \phi_s$, and $$\phi_s = \mathtt{atan2}(-\sin h \cos \delta, \ \sin \delta \cos \Phi - \cos h \cos \delta \sin \Phi)$$ This formula yields results consistent with the NOAA Solar Calculator in my tests. We need to solve for $h$, but how isn't yet obvious to me; maybe someone else can help? Notes: 

Part (1). Due to the earth's rotation, an observer on the equator moves 180 deg every 12 hours. Your satellite is moving perpendicular to the equatorial plane and it meets the observer on the other side of its orbit after 12 hours. Therefore it too has travelled 180 degrees. To revolve a further 180 degrees (and complete a full 360 degree revolution), in time to meet the observer again, the satellite would take another 12 hours. Therefore the time period of the satellite would have to be 12h + 12h = 24h. (2) A satellite with a time period of 24h is called a geosynchronous satellite. The radius $r$ of the orbit of this type of satellite is approximately 36,000 km, can be determined by working further into this formula... $$ \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ So, in your second diagram, we can see that the radius of the satellite is 36,000 km, and we know the radius of the earth is 6400km, so by Pythagoras rule, the distance $d$ to the satellite when it sets can be obtained by, $$d = \sqrt{36000^2 - 6400^2}$$ 

Follow these steps to determine Declination $\delta$ (Equivalent to Latitude). To get the sun's GHA, you need to first calculate $RA$ (Right Ascension) as shown above and then convert this to GHA by these= rules... $SHAÂ° = 360 â 15 Â· RA[h] $ $GHA_{Aries}Â° = 15 Â· GST[h] $ $GHA = SHA + GHA_{Aries}$ For the second step, you will need $GST$ (Greenwich Sidereal Time) which is you can calculate if you know UT (UT can be obtained from the time shown by a clock). Use this link to convert directly from UT to GST If you want a simple, concise way to be able to calculate the positions of all manner of celestial bodies, the sun, moon, planets, stars, then I highly recommended the book Astronomical Formulae for Calculators by Jean Meeus. It is the simplest, most comprehensive collection of astronomical formulae you are likely find anywhere on earth. 

No anti-gravity to be seen here. Really, learn the basics of physics if your interested and hopefully you'll find that not only is it interesting, but it can explain things without the need to invent other explanations. Usually. :-) 

For gravity the force is : $$F=\frac {G M_1 M_2} {r^2}$$ But the acceleration : $$a=\frac F {M_2} =\frac {G M_1 } {r^2}$$ and this is the same for all bodies as it depends only on the primary's mass ($M_1$). 

There is a probability we're the first, a probability we're the last, a probability we're the insert-any-number. I think the general scientific view at the moment is that it would be surprising if we were the first intelligent civilization in the galaxy, let alone the entire universe. But that's not to say we might not be the only intelligent civilization, just to say that there's always a possibility. From a scientific point of view there's no reason (at present) to suppose we're unique or the first. There's not much to say beyond speculation and back-of-the-envelope calculations at present. And those calculations change wildly depending on who you ask. 

I think the best model we could use for this is nuclear test fallout, whose dispersion was monitored quite extensively. It's very, very dependent on weather patterns at altitude. For example, the Castle Bravo test mushroom cloud reached at altitude of about 40km and hence hit the Jet Stream. In addition to this the wind speeds at lower altitudes were higher than ground speeds and this was not checked for, so the combination of factors spread the fallout downwind about 280 miles (about 430 km) in about 16 hrs. This was one reason for the irradiation of many people. What these tests and other nuclear incidents show us is that material ejected into the high atmosphere can remain there a long time, even circling the globe like traces from Fukushima. In theory trace particles from a meteor could remain in the upper atmosphere for days, months, even years. Most would be expected to fall within days, however.
