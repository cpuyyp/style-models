You also need to research more projects this employee worked on. Have they been on 25 different projects, excluding yours? If so, then it really isn't a big deal that one of the projects was for _____, which didn't fall in line with your particular beliefs. I've worked on literally dozens of projects, and the scope of the "beliefs" of each project range so far across the medium that it's not even funny any more. Try not to be a bigot in this case. In the end, it all boils down to which role you want to play. Who do you want to support? Yourself? Your "company"? (are you, in-fact, in control of the company?) The public? Your employee? Personally, professionally, ethically and morally, I would select either option 2 or 4. Chances are, if the employee is passionate about helping people, they'll agree to one or the other. Most people are understanding about these things, and it seems a lot of issues on this site boil down to "poor communication", such as this situation. You're literally asking Internet strangers to tell you how to resolve an issue behind the back of someone who has done no wrong. That's the worst kind of disrespect. Treat your employee with the same respect they have treated you, and it sounds like they have been very respectful. 

This was literally the password I used to access certain systems that were, in fact, not in my home. These were systems that I needed to always remember access for, prevent brute-force attacks for, and avoid the possibility of someone reading over my shoulder. (It's hard to follow an 8-12 character password, it's harder to follow a sentence of a password.) Now, after typing this time-and-time again it literally became second nature, and that sentence (which, hilariously, is one of the lines from "Once in a Lifetime" by the Talking Heads) became the single fastest sentence I can now type. So take one of these inappropriate passwords you came up with (which are also, conveniently, designed to require a lot of thinking power to process) and ask yourself: am I comfortable with burning this information into my brain and nature? You will literally be thinking about these things on a very frequent basis, and if the password is something you don't feel inappropriate thinking about, then I guess that answers that. 

Depending on the local legality (in the U.S. this is entirely illegal AFAIK, but IANAL), you can fire the employee. This is probably the worst possible decision to make, as you'll probably have to give them a nice severance package to make sure they don't tell the world that you fired them for believing in _____, which would damage your companies reputation so badly I'd be surprised if you didn't become the next Theranos. Discuss this with the employee. Assuming this is a project where there is some sort of crediting / accreditation, consider the option of either obfuscating (via a pen-name, etc.) or entirely removing credit to the employee to "avoid a potential negative public response." Depending on the project, scope, and employee, this may actually work out really, really well. You can keep the employee recused from the public (mostly), and still retain good relations. Scrap the project. This is probably the second worst possible decision. I put this above firing the employee in acceptability because this will help preserve some of your reputation, depending on the "reason" you scrapped it. At least you can make something up that helps preserve your public image. If you have a different, non-special-organization project, consider swapping the designers / employees. This gives you the best of both worlds: you can be truthful about who was the designer on the project, and you can avoid the potential negative public image of having an employee whose "views" (I quoted it because you don't say, and I assume you don't even know if the employee worked on previous project because of their views: you're speculating) don't align with the project. Fire-fight. Wait until release to see what happens. It may be the case that no one really cares, or they may care. Handle it like many other organizations and just do it and fight whatever fires may arise. Chances are very few people will look up the designer, find that they supported ____, and start a riot against your company for that. 

I am a trainee developer at a large (~120 people) web agency, about 7 days from passing my probation. During my interview and on the contract it says the work hours are from 9:30am to 6:30pm. I always work at least those hours, and often overtime. I studied biochemistry at university, but fell in love with web development. I don't have a CS degree or any qualifications as a developer; and my employers know this when he hired me. But he has criticized me twice since then for not being enthusiastic, and not using my time to make up for it. Both of which I find extremely untrue and unfair. I do a lot of relevant reading in my own time (for my own interests, not because he requested). Lately, I've been given projects with unreasonable deadlines, and they expect me to overtime without pay. I mean, I know I am not as skilled as my other colleagues, but it shouldn't mean I have to be a slave, giving all my time to do their projects. What's worse, they don't teach me anything, so I gain very little in these overtime. There's an overtime culture at the company; people there are happy to work, go home, sleep and work again the next day. I cannot do that. I am not as skilled as them, yes; that's why I need my own time to learn new things that they should be teaching me, but are not. How should I approach my boss to tell him that he is expecting too much? Without risk getting fired. UPDATE 7 NOV, 2014 Conditions did not get better, OT'd until 5am on many nights and also OT'd every weekend for the past month. After refusing to OT anymore, I was fired. In hindsight, sticking around wasn't such a bad idea, it really made me appreciate my own time more, and my work ethic is much better now. And now I have found work with a new company, who is smaller but have big clients too, and they've said "we work like a bank" - 0930 to 1830, you leave at 1830, no weekends - and they pay much better, which I didn't think was possible! I'll continue to give my best for this company! 

I am a trainee developer at a large (~120 people) web agency, about 7 days from passing my probation. I was feeling unwell this morning (Thursday) but I went in anyway because I have a deadline for a substantial project to meet in 4 days time (Monday). I was only briefed on this project yesterday (Wednesday). Work days are only Monday - Friday so technically I only have Friday and Monday to do this. I am still quite ill and the fever and dizziness is only slightly better, so I most probably won't be able to go into work tomorrow. However, I don't think it is fair to just dump an entire project on me with a deadline I know I won't manage to make. I have voiced this out with the person in charge of this project and he just shrugged it off without offering to help. I have been criticised by my boss twice during probation because he feels I am not enthusiastic, that my technical skills are much lower than my colleagues (I am a biochemist by training) and that I do not study further outside of work to make up for it (which I do, I left a career in science because I am passionate about programming). So I am afraid that if I continue to be sick (which I can't really help), I might get fired because I was unable to meet this deadline, which is unreasonably set in the first place. I look after myself well but these past weeks have been suffering from sleeplessness (I won't be able to sleep until 2am and would wake up by myself at 6am, 7am), probably because of the stress. The only solution I can think of is to go in on the weekends (provided I have recovered), but then would it be rude of me to ask for time off in lieu at the later time? 

Just to add some additional information: Consider the situation from your employers point of view, where they terminated you for a "gross misconduct", which typically means they really were not happy with what you did and would prefer you to never speak to them again. There's a huge chance they just want to forget you ever existed and leave it at that. If you go reapplying to a different store, not only have you dug up what could become "old wounds", but you've also shown them that you haven't really learned anything, especially if it's even remotely close to when you were terminated. It may seem counterintuitive, but employers (especially in related fields) do communicate with each other within regions and areas. My employer is very well aware of people that are terminated by our competition. Most companies (especially in smaller towns to mid-sized cities) talk with each other. If you work for retailer A, and they fire you, chances are retailer B already knows about it, through the grapevine of information travel within the city. Your best bet is to not only not apply on a job with the company you were fired from, but (as I saw a related question where you ask about a CV so you're obviously looking for a new job) also apply in either a completely unrelated field (if you are in retail now you should go work for a software engineering company or something), or in an entirely different region (if you are in the United States, I'd consider at least two states away). Things like "theft" and "financial abuse" and such are very much looked down upon, and chances are that all the local retailers (if that's the field you were in) know who you are and what you did. If you go pursuing a career with the previous employer, or with another retailer in your region, you're asking for trouble. Find a new place you fit well. I hate to be blunt, but you messed up and you're not going to fix it by pushing back against them. 

Second, we type passwords in a lot, which means they become part of us. I used to use a passphrase that I'm going to post here as an example due to the fact that it's been retired from my usage for literally half a decade: 

Yes this literally happened. I messed up. Three years ago (almost to the day) I applied to a company, did their technical test, interviewed, and was offered a job. Today I accidentally reapplied, and a different person responded to my application (almost immediately, literally minutes from application) with the exact same technical skills test I had last time. Do I tell this new person about the events from three years ago? I'd definitely take the job now, the only reason I didn't then was due to a salary and benefits advantage of an alternate company. I did my diligence and called them back and informed them (politely) that I couldn't take the position as a better opportunity arose.
