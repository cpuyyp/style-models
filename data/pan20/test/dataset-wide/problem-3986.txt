If $M$ is a finitely generated module over a local ring $(R, \mathfrak{m})$, we can detect whether $M$ has a nonzero free direct summand as follows: Consider the natural map $$\phi_M\colon \mathrm{Hom}_R(M,\mathfrak{m}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_R(M,R)$$ induced by the inclusion of $\mathfrak m$ into $R$. Then $M$ has a nonzero free direct summand if and only if $\\phi_m$ is not surjective. (If $M$ has no free direct summand, then the image of every homomorphism $M \longrightarrow R$ must be inside $\mathfrak m$, so $\phi_M$ is surjective. The converse is easy as well.) I'd like a more precise statement to be true. The cokernel of $\phi_M$ is a submodule of $\mathrm{Hom}_R(M,R/\mathfrak{m})$, so is a finite-dimensional vector space. 

Allen Knutson has a nice recent preprint which, among other things, discusses a class of rings (of prime characteristic) for which a certain supersubclass of the radical ideals is closed under sum. They're called "Frobenius split rings." I guess they're originally defined by Brion and Kumar. They are defined to be those rings $R$ of characteristic $p$ admitting an additive map $\phi\colon R \rightarrow R$ such that $\phi(a^pb) = a\phi(b)$ and $\phi(1)=1$. An ideal $I$ is "compatibly split" if $\phi(I) \subseteq I$. Compatibly split ideals are radical, prime components of a compatibly split ideal are compatibly split, and if $I$ and $J$ are compatibly split, then so is $I+J$. 

One of my all-time leading candidates for Most Preposterous Theorem Ever: Definition: A polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ is indecomposable if whenever $f(x) = g(h(x))$ for polynomials $g$, $h$, one of $g$ or $h$ is linear. Theorem. Let $f, g$, be nonconstant indecomposable polynomials over $\mathbb C$. Suppose that $f(x)-g(y)$ factors in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$. Then either $g(x) = f(ax+b)$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{C}$, or $$\operatorname{deg} f = \operatorname{deg} g = 7, 11, 13, 15, 21, \text{ or } 31,$$ and each of these possibilities does occur. The proof uses the classification of the finite simple groups [!!!] and is due to Fried [1980, in the proceedings of the 1979 Santa Cruz conference on finite groups], following a the reduction of the problem to a group/Galois-theoretic statement by Cassels [1970]. [W. Feit, "Some consequences of the classification of finite simple groups," 1980.] 

Yes. See Fossum, Foxby, Griffith, and Reiten, "Minimal injective resolutions with applications to dualizing modules and Gorenstein modules" (Theorem 1.1) and also Roberts, "Two applications of dualizing complexes over local rings". An earlier paper by Foxby, "On the mu_i in a minimal injective resolution" settles several special cases, including when $A$ or $M$ is CM, $\mathrm{depth} M \geq \mathrm{depth} A$, or $M$ has finite injective dimension. 

Yes. One can even restrict to $M=A/I$ for ideals $I$, and if $A$ is Noetherian it is enough to consider $M=A/p$ for prime ideals $p$. This is Lemma 18.1 in Matsumura's book "Commutative ring theory". 

No, this would force $R_\mathfrak{m}$ to be Cohen-Macaulay. So a non-CM domain like $R=k[X^4,X^3Y,XY^3,Y^4]$ would be a counterexample. 

If the answer is Yes, here's another desideratum: does the notion of "limit" extend to modules/sheaves over the singularities? My motivation here is that the $A_n$ and $D_n$ are (almost) precisely the equicharacteristic hypersurfaces with finite Cohen-Macaulay type (i.e. only finitely many indecomposable MCM modules), while $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ are precisely the ones with countable or bounded CM type. I'd really like some statement that each MCM module over the "limit" "comes from" a module "at some finite stage". 

Is there any software that will compute cohomology of vector bundles (or just line bundles) on flag manifolds? The only one I know of is Macaulay2, via the Schubert2 package, but it works with what it calls "abstract varieties", which are really just the intersection rings over $\mathbb{Q}$, so it's explicitly limited to characteristic zero. I'm interested in (among other things) bad behavior at small prime characteristics. 

As always, it depends on what you think "explicitly" means. It's a Fourier-Mukai transform; see, for example, Van den Bergh and Hille's expository article. It can also be explained in terms of so-called non-commutative crepant resolutions, see Van den Bergh. 

When $(R, \mathfrak{m})$ is a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring, then the multiplicity $\mathrm{e}(R)$ is the sharp upper bound for the number of generators $\mu_R(I)$ of ideals $I$ of $R$. It's sharp because it's also the stable value of $\mu_R(\mathfrak{m}^n)$ for $n$ large (this part doesn't need CM). 

No. Since it is the unique maximal ideal, $\mathfrak m$ contains every prime ideal (its complement is the set of all units of $R$). 

Edited to add: Well, now I feel embarrassed to have gotten an answer accepted which is absolute garbage, so I think I should offer an actual answer in addition to the indirect proof in a comment I made above (i.e. the Betti numbers of the cokernel $A$ of your matrix are 2,2,4,11,32,95,..., while those of the residue field $k$ are 1,4,13,40,121,364,..., so $k$ can't be a direct summand of $A$). Here's another that doesn't rely on computer algebra software. It does rely on $A$ being a graded module over the (naturally) graded ring $R$. Suppose $A \cong N \oplus k$. It's easy to check that $A$ has hilbert function $(2,6,1)$. Since $A$ is generated in a single degree, the copy of $k$ must also be generated in that degree, so $N$ has hilbert function $(1,6,1)$. In particular $N$ must be cyclic, $N \cong R/J$ for some $J$. But $R$ has hilbert function $(1,4,3)$, so can't have a quotient with hilbert function $(1,6,1)$. Edit: The below is wrong. Sorry. The minimal generators of the module $\mathrm {coker}\ M$ are the column vectors $(v,x)^T$ and $(y,z)^T$. They generate a two-dimensional vector space of all the minimal generators of the module. This is just $X/mX$, where $X = \mathrm{coker}\ M$ and $m=(x,y,z,v)$. If there is going to be a direct summand isomorphic to $k$, there must be a minimal generator which is annihilated by the maximal ideal. But one can write down a generic minimal generator $(av+by, ax+bz)^T$ and the 8 $k$-linear equations saying that it is annihilated by $x,y,z$ and $v$. Two of them are $v(av+by)=0$ and $z(ax+bz)=0$. The relations in the ring imply $bvy=0=avx$. Since $vy$ and $vx$ are nonzero in $R$, this means $a=0=b$, and so there is no such direct summand. Would you tell us why you thought there should be such a direct summand? 

You want to assume also that the residue field is infinite. Then a minimal reduction of the irrelevant ideal will be a system of parameters, each linear, and will be a maximal regular sequence. 

(1) No. Use prime avoidance: if the maximal ideal is not associated, it is not contained in the union of the associated primes together with $\mathfrak{m}^2$. (2) Yes, consider $k[[x^2]] \subset k[[x]]$. 

If $R = k[x,y]$ and we throw in $\frac {x^2}y$, we get $k[x,y,z]/(zy-x^2)$, not regular. This shows that it's not enough to assume $a,b$ form a regular sequence. The only sufficient condition I can come up with is that $a$ be outside the square of (every/the) maximal ideal 

Necessary and sufficient conditions for your question to have a positive answer are that $A$ be $\textit{unmixed}$, that is, every associated prime is a minimal prime, and $\textit{equidimensional}$, that is, $\mathrm{dim} (A/\mathfrak{p}) = \mathrm{dim}(A)$ for every minimal prime $\mathfrak p$. Charles Staats' example is not equidimensional. The one-dimensional ring $A=k[x,y]/(x^2,xy)$ is not unmixed, and $A/(y)$ has dimension zero. Sufficiency follows from the fact that the set of zerodivisors of $A$ is equal to the union of the associated primes. 

This would be a very strong version of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture (see here, for example) in the Gorenstein case. The Conjecture is still open, though many partial results are known. By the way, this paper (ScienceDirect link, may not be visible to everyone) claims a proof of the Conjecture in the Gorenstein case, which would give an affirmative answer to your question, but I --- and several other people I've talked to --- believe there is a gap in the proof. Their assumption is that $\mathrm{Ext}_R^{i}(M,M)=0$ for $i =1,2$. The questionable step is at the top of page 2163, the second line, where they say "therefore ... is exact".
