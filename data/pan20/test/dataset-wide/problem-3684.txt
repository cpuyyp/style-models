Genetically engineering your muscles? Not in the next decade or two. Steroids without exercise? No. Steroids increase the protein available to cells, which effectively allows you to work your muscles harder so they grow more. 

BTW, I'm 51 and am starting to find it harder to keep my fitness at a level I think of as very good. 

I ski in Austria and Italy with quite a bit of off piste / black run fun. I generally keep pretty fit, but in the 6 to 8 weeks before I go skiing I shift a couple of my workouts to favour squats, dead lifts and box jumps (with ankle weights when possible). 

For advanced bodybuilders, their is often only either "bulk" (maintain body fat, build muscle), or "cut" (maintain muscle, decrease body fat). 

Losing fat and maintaining weight implies building muscle. Building muscle and losing fat at the same time is difficult, although there is the phenomenon that sometimes works for novices. The only thing you can do is 

As far as I know, there's nothing you can do for preventing muscle soreness. But as soon as you get accustomed to the exercise, it should get better. As it basically boils down to providing nutrients to your muscle fibers, the quality of your nutrition matters as well, of course. 

The calculators I've seen on the internet tend to use a variety of indicators BMI (height, weight) rest heart rate (not always called that), how much exercise you get and dietary factors to calculate a "body age". Personally, I don't put to much faith in this kind of calculator except in general terms. Eat healthy, get plenty exercise, don't smoke and you will probably live longer. However, how long you live is mainly controlled by your genetics. My grandmother lived to 98 and smoked every day from when she was in her twenties. A friend who is a yoga teacher and eats well has currently been diagnosed with cancer. 

You are right, for increasing muscle mass, training at intensity that allows you to perform 8-12 reps per set is reasonable. But note that it's not the number of repetitions per set that make the muscles grow, but the intensity of each repetition. If you are able to do more than 8-12 reps per set with a certain weight, the intensity of that weight has decreased for you, and training with that weight will not have the same effects than before, even if you increase the number of sets. 

Your worth is not measured by how much you can lift. “Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. ” ― M. Scott Peck I suspect your barrier to change is not physical, but in your head. No, I don't think you're crazy, but (speaking from personal experience here) many people believe things about themselves that are not true and cause them to limit themselves drastically. 

I would strongly recommend too get a pull up bar, some rings, or a suspension trainer. Maybe one of the latter two make sense for you, as they can also be used for many other exercises. If you don't want to buy anything, try to use a door for pull ups. I think in order to gain strength, 10 pound dumbbells are too light, you should definetly train with higher intensity (like 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps each for each exercise). But training intensities are another story... Of course you should keep doing pushing exercises as well to prevent unbalance. 

Some of it could be water retention. Are you weighing youself at the same time each day, after toilet, prior to work out and breakfast? Are you using any diet supplements? 

You can do trunk extensions flat on the floor. Or if you prefer you can use pretty much anything to lift you up a little eg a folded blanket or cushions. $URL$ 

I can't find what I would consider a reliable reference for the 35% figure. As far as I can make out, (mung) Bean Sprouts are about 3% protein. So 200 grams would give you about 6 grams. Alfalfa sprouts have slightly more perhaps 4% protein. A Guideline Daily Amount or protein for a man would be 55grams and 45 grams for a woman. So, I'd have to say no, 200g of sprouts would not be enough protein on its own. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

When I'm doing pull ups, I try to go all the way down until the arms are straight, but I do not lock out my shoulders. Recently, I thought in order to get a greater ROM, it might be a good idea to completely lock out my shoulders at the bottom. After the workout I felt a slight shoulder pain. Is there any real benefit in locking out shoulders? Or is it just bad for my shoulders and I should avoid it? 

I have a weakness in my back from an injury 20 years ago. I find that working my back to make it stronger is a great help. If I ignore my back I start getting back pain. I find that kettlebell swings, deadlifts (stiff legged and normal) and squats if I'm very careful about good form are all beneficial. In general the advice to lift with your legs is good advice, but excluding your back from any exercise is not a good idea. 

In theory, you can. Stamina can be trained with any kind of muscles, as long as you are getting training is a very high volume (which implies a low intensity). Note that stamina consists of muscular endurance (which depends on the muscles that are trained), and cardiovascular endurance (which depends on the whole cardiovascular system) In practice though, most people probably won't develop as much stamina (in terms of muscular endurance) in their upper body as in their legs, because they simply get more volume in using their legs (unless they start walking on their hands all the time). That being said, if you want to improve cardiovascular endurance, you will probably get faster results with leg workouts, because your legs already have more muscular endurance which gives you the ability of higher volume training. 

Well, I don;t know much about you, so this may be inapropriate, but there are things called "treadmill desks" which allow you to work standing up and walking. Try Googling "treadmill desk" and you should get the idea. $URL$ 

Sit ups can be bad for you back! $URL$ Planks are great. Captians Chair is good too. But the number one exercise for core strength IMHO is squats. Counter intuitive perhaps, but they work for me. I have a dodgy back (hasn't needed surgery yet) and squats help quite a bit. But don't overdo the weight. $URL$ $URL$
