We are Graduates in a company. I was the new graduate... joining the already tight-knit graduate group. We are a happy gang, going to lunch together etc. I was very busy, working outside one day, and this older graduate rang me to get my password, so that she can do her (newly assigned) work. For your info, she needed my credentials to login to a client's server, to do her (newly assigned) work. You're not allowed to share passwords! In my mind, alarm bells. This is illegal according to company policy. So, I told her I was busy, that I couldn't remember my password (truth. I haven't used the password in months), and that I'll let her know in about an hour, when I would be free to find my unused password. She kept ringing me... and I ignore her. 5 ignored calls later, I got annoyed, and called up her manager, asking if she has the permission to use my credentials. She didn't have permission. About 10 minutes later, and about 3 ignored calls later, she was granted permission to use my credentials. I can give her my credentials now, without any risk of repercussions. However, I was still busy... About 10 minutes later, I receive an email from her, with EVERYONE CC'd to the email. Basically it said something like, "Hi all. Amy (manager's name), thank you for the permission to use John's credentials. Right now, John didn't give me his credentials and so preventing me from working. John, give me your credentials so that I can do my job. Regards..." That last part, "...so that I can do my job", really irked me. In my mind, "Why, and how could you send this to EVERYONE? (I felt betrayed). Also, who am I to prevent you from doing your job? I am not your manager. I am not your baby sitter." I am very pissed off at this stage, and I made a mistake by being a righteous prick, by replying (to her, along with everyone) like this: "Hi... I have told you that I am extrememly busy with a client, and that I will get back to you... Please do not demand information from me, I do not appreciate it, especially when you do not have the authorization... As per company policy, you are not allowed to share credentials, especially when a client has entrusted you with it.... You now have the authorization now, so here are my credentials..." I thought I had done the justifiably right thing - following company policy, and explaining why I didn't immediately give my credentials. After that email was sent, it was probably the point of no return. Basically, all the graduates, many immediately, have started to give me the silent treatment. They went out to lunch without me. They stopped inviting me to anything anymore. They talked about their graduate party in the weekend / movie nights. THey said all of these things around me, and ignore me like I don't exist. In my mind, I have offended ONE person. I didn't offend 10 others in the group. But it was like I offended everyone. I felt horribly sad for many months to come. I tried sucking it up. I kept thinking, "Why is everyone against me on this? Makes absolutely no sense" I lost many hours of sleep for many days. I still haven't come to terms with this whole ordeal. (thus, this question... many months later.) After about a month, I said, "This isn't a good way to live..." and so, very awkwardly, tried to apologise to her. She ignored the F out of me, like I didn't exist.... I tried to apologise, or just talk to another graduate who I (have now previously) respected, by very awkwardly and uncomfortably saying, "Hey, I don't know if I have offended you, but if you would like to talk about it I am open to it..." I was basically about to sh!t my pants at that point. He mumbled to me to "F*ck off". I seeked professional counciling over this as I felt horrible for many months. The psychologist told me that I was a victim of bullying (silent treatment), but I believe it's their job to help you come to terms with things. I couldn't let it go, especially when the workplace attitude didn't change. Management somehow found out about this. We had a chat. Basically they made me feel like 'bad guy' (quotes, because I think nothing's ever black and white), by saying, "Apparently you threw someone under a bus..." although they never admitted whether I was wrong or right. I told them my side of the story, and then they sighed... and basically they told me to "use the phone next time", and literally "Ignore the haters". 

I had this interview for a Software Development position. I'm from Kosovo and the job opening was in Germany. They were also offering visa sponsorship. I'm a Web Developer and the position was open for all levels. Rating myself, I'm way off the "Junior" title, but also need a few more years of work experience to go "Senior". So the Skype interview was nice and the interviewer was really friendly. However, he asked me 2-3 questions and he concluded I'm not a fit for his team. First question: Explain the IoC container. Second question: Explain the repository design pattern. After I struggled answering the questions, especially the first one because I wasn't aware of the term, but I knew about the design itself without putting a term to it, the interviewer said I'm not a fit for his team. I also showed him a 5% completed API that I'm working on and he said that my code is really good and clean, but I have too many controllers... All while being unaware what the actual project is and why it needs those controllers (they were just scaffolds anyway, I'm still far from touching those parts). He told me that HIS team needs a Senior level developer, but he'd pass my CV to the other teams which need other levels - I haven't heard from them and its been over a week. Anyway, how does not knowing these terms make you a bad programmer? I believe that these interviews should be more technical and require the interviewee to write actual code that might be suitable for the company. I think asking "What's an IoC container" might confuse a lot of people and it's an unfair way to check if the interviewee is qualified. This is the first time I've had a "professional" interview with a big company and to be frank, I felt a little unprepared and intimidated. What are some tips to handle these interviews like a pro? Do I really need to know programming definitions? 

Alright, so I'm in a team of web developers (RoR devs), consisting of 4 other people. My manager's programming abilities are ridiculously low comparing to the other team members. So that's causing a lot of delays in projects, as he's always the one starting them and then handing his work so we can continue extending it. Then usually we end up rewriting everything from scratch, because he's really that bad. Also before a project starts, we have brief discussions on how stuff should be. On the last project WE had to organize a meeting so we can give a structure to the project. This is definitely poor management and this costs the company very much. So, what would be the best way to confront the manager about his poor skills and maybe even ask him to step down from his role? 

I just joined a new company which is a new start up, STILL applying for funds etc. The product is very promising and likely to be a success once fully released to the public (we're currently in a closed beta). It has a very nice user interface and an easy experience, so design wise it's top notch. However, the application itself is written quite poorly. I'm a Senior Web Developer in this company and I was a little shocked with the lack of structure of the code. The manager (Main Senior? Can't think of an appropriate name) is very logical and always has the right solutions in mind and can also code them out nicely, but they are not very efficient performance wise and don't follow any particular concept (eg. DRY). We use a kind of a MVC model, but it's not very efficient and does not save us from the headaches it should fix. Code repetition is a major problem and so is the amount of jQuery, Ajax calls, unnecessary timeouts etc. The database abstraction layer seems very inefficient too and it doesn't include any sort of ORM. So to sum this up, the code is a mess, but the product works (can't judge the security yet). I would be able to take the whole project and code it from scratch with some rules in mind. I would make it easy to extend while preserving the same functionality, though it would take a while since a lot was done. I would incorporate things that would make development for the future team very seamless, such as: 

I understand that topics such as religion, race, age, etc are off limits in an employer / employee interview. However, are such topics allowable for discussion between potential business partners? I found a posting on Craigslist asking for a business partner. I responded, and I received back an email from the poster which linked to a few of their web pages on social networks so that I could 'see what sort of person they are' (in their words). The first link that I visited, their Google+ page, was extremely focused on the importance of religion in all aspects of their life. While I don't have a problem with anyone having their own beliefs, especially someone I'm just doing business with, I don't want to enter into a partnership that will be a constant attempted conversion, nor do I want issues to occur later if the business should flourish (for instance, providing any future employees health coverage that includes family planning). What are the legalities surrounding what I can and cannot ask / talk about in my response? 

A few answers, and the OP, have concentrated on her use of her gender as a shield. I would like to take the opportunity to point out the math of this situation. I know Iâ€™m late to this party, but this is an important point for future discussion of the subject. Just over 50% of the population is female, though more males work and women are not well represented in every field. Giving you the benefit of the doubt we will assume you work in an IT operation; a field well known for male dominance. In my experience, an 8 person IT outfit will have one manager, one marketer/BA, one administrative generalist, and five IT staff. Statistically, female prevalence in these roles ($URL$ are 27%, 60%, 94%, and 21% respectively. Now, if we believe all scientific evidence in recent history we can safely assume that work performance is equal across genders, which means that if your company hires the best person for the job for each position, the gender distribution for your company will follow that of the aforementioned fields. We can then calculate the statistical probability that your company will hire all men as: 73% * 40% * 6% * (79% ^ 5) This comes to 0.54%. What that means is that your company may be an innocent victim. However, it is 185x more likely, statistically, that the only reason your company has such an issue is that they have unfairly discriminated in some way in their hiring practices. Put another way, if this employee is using her gender as a shield, she's only using a shield that your company forged and handed her (ie: if there are several competent female employees in the office then there's no shield for poor workers to hide behind). So claims of reverse discrimination can be nullified by evidence of actual discrimination on the other side; but it's likely far too complicated a situation for us (or likely even you) to figure out and/or address. That out of the way, your other issues are adequately addressed in other answers. Her medical situation is not your business, so that complaint is not relevant either. Her workload is not necessarily your responsibility if you are a peer, but squarely within the purview of your manager. In short, there is no situation for you to deal with. There is a situation for your manager to deal with, and there is far too little information here for us to describe the best way for him to do so. Though a good first step would be to stop making sexist remarks in the office to other employees behind this employee's back. Next steps may be to work on a flex time system, reduced pay or unpaid-time-off system (possibly via FMLA), or perhaps just general forgiveness that will be extended to other employees in times of need as well.
