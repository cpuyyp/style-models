"Ethics" is not defined by our [or anyone's] pleasure / pain. "Ethics" is not defined by our [or any] society. "Ethics" is about good and bad "Ethics" can be understood systemically. The "metaphysics" is that he thinks we can work this out as a system and he's claiming it is real. 

A related objection was raised by Bernard Williams. His objection to utilitarianism is that it's not ethics. His reason is that we don't accept moral judgments from the utilitarian calculus. Instead, we make up utilitarian calculuses and we then check whether they produce morally absurd outcomes. To illustrate, if our happiness calculator says everyone should kill at least 5 people as soon as possible, we would rather than accept this conclusion, decide that the calculation is wrong and has failed to capture what people should do. In both objections, the basic idea is that the real moral work is happening somewhere other than the calculus. If we're going to accept utilitarianism we need a robust idea of what happiness is and we will need to equate that with the good. One modern view with close affinity is "desire fulfillment" or "freedom maximization". The former is a view about the nature of happiness. It equates with the idea that happiness happens when you get what you desire and your desires are largely your own. The latter is a type of consequentialism that says the thing we want to maximize is the ability of rational beings to make free choices. If you put these views together, you can have a utilitarianism that's moderately agnostic about what happiness is but thinks we should create a world where people are maximally able to pursue it. 

So there's a lot of middle ground between it's all interpretation and it's all pure fact that we can get without using our brains to do something to it. 

and there you go. The hard part is that fitch lacks contradiction elimination. Instead, you need to use Negation Introduction, here's how you do that for the top half: 

Hegel and Schelling were not on good terms at the time the book was written, so if it was a novel development by Hegel, then Schelling would have wanted to distinguish his position from it. None other than Charles Taylor notes the following about Hegel's failure to predict evolution: 

(In the above count, I've skipped over two things that I want to mention now. First, the example with running a mile in 4:00 is not ideal -- but it's not ideal for reasons that are immaterial to answering the question here. One problem is that Aristotle's ethics are adaptive in that the mean is excellence with respect to your own nature, time, and circumstances. But, this does not mean that Aristotle adjusts this to the point where someone disabled is going to reach his bar of excellence. Instead, it's something that raises a far more complex problem. Specifically, to know what is most excellent is something that is limited to the man of practical wisdom (phronemos), and those who are not phronemos are not going to be able to find the exact mean of excellence for action). The second issue is that there's some question as to whether actions or people are the one's who receive praise/blame in Aristotle or how the two relate if both are involved (as they seem to be in his account). ) 

Descartes disagrees adamantly with your "surely" ( dangerous word in philosophy). Moreover, it's not a tautology because 'I' by itself doesn't prove anything. Specifically, this is because he has banished all sorts of evidence except his mental activity. 

The objection you are raising is a common both among students and scholars with respect to Kant. Some versions of the objection are better worded and structured than others, and some versions seems to misunderstand Kant pretty badly. I'm going to parse some pieces of your first paragraph here: 

I'm having a little trouble connecting the dots between what you put at the top and your question. What I see is : (1) Definition of Forms for Plato / God's Ideas for Augustine as immutable and eternal entities. Then (2) If always 1 + 1 = 2, then 1+ 1. Ergo, this is eternal and immutable. What I'm missing is the precise question you are asking as it relates to (1) and (2). As worded, I would say that (2) holds (being merely definitional -- something that is always is true eternally and immutably true) but does not necessarily force upon us the conclusion (1). Specifically, I see two moves hidden between (2) and (1) that undermine the necessity. First, (1) posits eternal, immutable entities about substantive things in the world (Plato believes there's a form of horse, for instance) whereas (2) posits only a invariant proportion as eternal and immutable (which has no perfect physical instantiation). Second, the argument in (2) is in Kant's vocabulary a priori and "synthetic" -- meaning that the manipulation is wholly contained in the definitions that 1 + 1 = 2 (synthesis of two incidents of the concept 1). Thus, it's not entirely clear that we are saying anything eternal or immutable so much as we are rearranging words. And that we can make this statement using only the reason we have (a priori). Conversely, substantive forms/ideas are substantiated by objects in the world (either through the activity of the demiurge or the creator) as reflections on it. None of that is necessary to accept the continued veracity of 1 + 1 = 2. To accept (2) is roughly to be committed to Mathematical Platonism. 

The list of people Socrates says he tested to see whether they knew anything includes the occupations of his main accusers. Socrates' response to the accusation of atheism is not a clear denial of atheism but rather depends on his opponents drawing a conclusion that is potentially fallacious based on wordplay. When he loses, he asks for the punishment of being lauded like those who win in the Olympics with free food at expense of the Athenians (the case in question). 

Philosophy is not about finding the meaning of things. Philosophy should do logical analysis. Logical analysis looks at the meaning of things (i.e., the value of things is that they should fit under logical analysis). Ergo, philosophy is not about logical analysis. 

The answer is going to greatly depend on what you think creativity means. If creativity is taken to mean "able to create something we find pleasant to experience", then the answer is clearly yes. If creativity is taken to mean "able to engage in a creative process" that yields a novel creation, then much will hinge on what we think such a process is. Assuming that humans can engage in such a creative enterprise and this is what we talk about when we mean creativity, this becomes a strongly philosophy of mind question (which is not my specialization). First, I want to comment on whether the human creative process can be identified with randomness. I am going to argue no for several reasons. First, little kids scrawl randomly on their drawing kits. And while we can say this involves some "creativity", we would say that the creative products of, say, John Howe are some how more creative. Or that a well thought Shakespeare play is more creative than a play generated by rolling the dice to figure out each line. Note that I am not saying that creativity could not include a component of randomness -- just that it is not randomness. Second, creativity also seems to involve a type a freedom. And rarely is it good for this to be randomness. Randomness looks free, but it's doubtful this is what we want as freedom for creativity. I at least would be less rather than more impressed to learn an interesting painting was just the best pick of a litter of random scribbles than to think someone freely chose to produce it. So then, take for instance, fractals. Fractals are pretty -- but they are not really creative at least not how I see the word nor are they generated according to a creative process that humans seem to use (they are generated through equations that lead to value fluctuations along the plotting axis and change colors as locations get more hits). I would say that no computer so far engages in what I would call creativity, but I don't know enough to make a further answer in terms of if we understand creativity in the brain or the mind well-enough to guess as to how human creativty works. 

This question seems like some sort of flame-bait, but there's a long history of a similar type of question about certain types of ethical views (though I don't see much to suggest you have that in mind, I will answer assuming there's a real question there). Specifically, this challenge has been raised by Knud Ejler Løgstrup towards Søren Kierkegaard's Works of Love. To state the accusation in more detail, we need to understand as a rough sketch what Kierkegaard is suggesting in the earlier part of the text. In rough outline, Kierkegaard suggests that we love God and then love people . The things we do for others are "works of love" that express our love for God. God also guarantees us eternal life (in Kierkegaard's theology). Thus, the accusation is that doing loving things for others is just a way to get patted on the back. A similar critique is also raised by Theodor Adorno. There's a significant amount of scholarship that argues against this critique. Most of this centers on clarifying what is meant by expressing our love for God in acts of love for others. One key is not seeing love as bifurcated such that you can only love one or the other. (I can love my wife and my brother without that being a contradiction). A second element is to see how love for one person can motivate love for another. (e.g., loving my brother could extend to loving my brother's children). Obviously, a slight variation on the accusation involves deleting the significance of the attributes of God and God inspiring love in the self. Doing so makes it a weird fantasy where the person enjoys doing good things for no reason out of self-love. (The observation can also be reversed and put on atheists -- accusing them of the same sort of selfishness for imagining there's good to do). I could delve more into the textual details, but I think this suffices to express your worry in more philosophical terms and to explain at least one route of trying to defend against it open to theists. 

X is true BECAUSE X is foolishness (i.e., cannot be known through argument). = if foolish, then true There is an argument that concludes X is true Then X is false (per modus tollens 1,2 ) 

I think you've largely got the idea down. Analytic means something that can be shown true without reference to anything else. This means either pure tautologies or expansions of definitions (if there's some other ingenious category, it does not spring to mind). The key value of analytic is that it is part of a pair. The other feature in the pair is synthetic where we learn something by adding to two different truth things together, such as combining two axioms. As generally used in philosophy, that's how the pair of terms works. For most of us, we know the terms through Kant where it occurs in tandem with a two further pairs: necessary vs. contingent and a priori vs. a posteriori. (These, like synthetic / analytic, does not truly originate in Kant but these terms are studied the most in trying to understand Kant). Here, the idea is how do I know something. Something that is a prior analytic can be known just by thinking of the term and working out what it means. That which is a prior synthetic involves the conjunction of multiple a priori truths to reach its conclusion. A posteriori items work based on evidence. These two can either be things that are identities or things that require working together multiple pieces. If my memory is correct, something that has an a posteriori element would then make the entire argument a posteriori for Kant. A second big name on this topic is Kripke who is famous for proposing the idea of a posteriori necessity in Naming and Necessity There's some more examples in a different question: What are examples of analytic a posteriori knowledge?
