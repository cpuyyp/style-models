One possibility would be that in the Treaty of Paris (1783), Florida might not have been returned to Spain, and instead might have been awarded to the newly independent United States which did not have sufficient military clout to put down the Muskogee insurgency. Spain, instead, might have gotten something different out of the Treaty of Paris (1783) such as favorable trade agreements with the newly independent United States. Another possibility would be that Charles IV would have turned on his wife's love, Manuel de Godoy, and had him executed for adultery, and then fallen under the influence of some other courtier who might, for example, have urged Charles IV to redirect Spanish military resources from Florida to the fight this Revolutionary France, sacrificing Florida in the hope of securing greater success in France which was closer to home and more important to the Bourbon family. A third possibility is that Charles IV could have been killed by revolutionary French agents in a move that would have triggered the Penisular War many years earlier with revolutionary France instead of Napoleon I, or could have led to a successor who retreated from the policies of Charles IV including the diversion of military resources to Florida. A fourth possibility is that if the Muskogee's could have held on just six more years, the Spanish would have had to sacrifice their military effort in Florida to focus on fighting with Napoleon I. One of the most plausible ways that this could have happened would have been for a spy to warn the Muskogee Republic that a major naval offensive was planned sometime early in the year 1800, and for a small group of saboteurs to have mounted a stealthy pre-emptive attack on the Spanish fleet destroying many of its ships and scuttling its planned offensive directed at San Marcos before it could be launched. In the face of this defeat, Charles IV might not have been willing to commit more forces to what would have seemed like a lost cause at that point. 

The details of what is going on in extremely strong gravitational fields near black holes and the Big Bang. An explanation for phenomena describes as "dark matter" and "dark energy" in extremely weak gravitational fields at distances on the order of the size of galaxies or larger. 

The Objective Lots of questions at this site consider how humans could be enhanced with genetic engineering. But, if you are an alien, you may have the opposite priorities. These aliens are civilized and have their own code of ecological ethics, so they don't want to exterminate humans (and would prefer to prevent massive, sudden population decline in humans, to the extent that this is possible). But, they do want to prevent humans from continuing to develop into a species that is technologically superior to them that could be a threat to the aliens, should humans gain access to interstellar transportation technologies that the aliens already possess, either developed by humans on their own, or by humans reverse engineering it from alien technology in a manner that would require an ability on the part of the humans to understand the underlying physics with this huge hint available. The aliens believe that humans are currently at least seventy years away from developing interstellar transportation technology on their own (assuming that they don't intervene). (This interstellar transportation technology involves fake physics of the usual sort for science fiction, such as space folding in dimensions not known to current science, that is at least as difficult as general relativity and quantum physics to invent, but is easy enough for a trained person to operate. The viability in the real world of this fake physics technology is not, itself, part of the question). The aliens are also aware that humans are at risk of self-extermination and would like to prevent that from happening. They also don't want to make a change so extreme that the affected people cannot properly be called humans, even though they are genetically modified humans. The aliens also value elegance and minimalism. They want to make changes that are as subtle as possible to achieve their goal. Also, the more subtle the effect, the more time it will take to detect it and mobilize a reaction to it, and the less time humans have to respond to the germ line retrovirus threat discussed below. Precedents In Fiction The closest analog to this that I can think of in fiction is Asimov's "brain fever" concept. The Germ Line Virus Mechanism The aliens have advanced bioengineering technologies and can engineer a germ line virus that would impact as many humans as viruses for the common cold or similar common viruses do today that would change the genetics of human sperm and egg cells causing everyone with at least one parent infected, before the sperm and/or egg cells that give rise to the child are formed, to have the genetic changes that the aliens desire. This technique would not reach 100% of the human population (at least not immediately) but would reach a very large proportion of the human population and would disproportionately impact humans that are not in isolated (usually technologically backward) communities. It would probably impact at least 90%-95% of the non-isolated human population in each generation, more or less randomly. So, in the second generation, less than 1% of the human population would be uninfected, and assuming more or less random mating, in the third generation, the unaffected non-isolated human population in the third generation could be in the hundreds or less. So, a solution that it likely to be possible to thwart if there are just a few hundred random people who are unaffected probably isn't sufficient. The Question What should the aliens target to modestly devolve and tame humanity in a way that prevents them from making technological progress (and that may even represent a step backward for mankind) without exterminating the species or causing a mass die off from the virus itself? 

For example, the closest fitting known exoplanet to the planet in your question is KOI-423b has a mass about 5721 times Earth's mass and a radius of about 13 times Earth's radius, giving it a surface gravity about about 33 times that of Earth. The radius of the Earth, in round numbers, is 4,000 miles. For exoplanet KOI-423b, you'd have a radius of about 64,000 miles (by comparison, the radius of Jupiter is 43,441 miles). Surviving Near Such A Planet There is no way to shield gravity. You can temporarily escape its pull on you by being in free fall, but that respite only lasts for a short duration and if you want to return to where you started, you need to accelerate away from the source of the gravity which temporarily makes the effective pull on you even worse. The only sustainable way to escape its effects is to stay a long way from the source of the gravitational pull. Therefore, the only way for a human to survive in an environment like that would be to be at a substantial distance from the surface where it is 30G. To get to 1G one would need to be about 4.5 times the radius of the planet from its surface. Of course, a human could survive with somewhat heavier gravity than 1G, but even 2G would be pretty intense. By the time someone is at 2.2 times the radius of the planet from its surface, gravity approaches 3G which is survivable in the short term but is close to the limit of what someone can survive on a prolonged basis. Carrie Vaughn's 2017 stand alone novel, "Martians Abroad" explores a similar issue as third-generation Martians accustomed to life on Mars at about 1/3rd G are sent to college on Earth and suffer through the higher gravity to which they are unaccustomed. (On the whole it is a good account although it fails to recognize that a kilogram is a unit of mass rather than weight, which is annoying to someone whose had that distinction pounded into him many, many times.) In the case of KOI-423b, the planet's gravity would have be Earth strength gravity at a distance 288,000 miles from the surface. At a distance 140,800 miles from the surface of KOI-423b, gravity would be 3G which is almost intolerable on a sustained basis for humans. At 30G, a whole host of issues like breathable air pressure become pretty much untenable for any human. It takes a huge feat of bioengineering for giraffes to be able to keep blood flow going to their heads as they swing them from the ground to being fully erect without passing out or having a stroke. This situation would be unfathomably more difficult every second of the day. Robots or remotely operated drones of some sort might be able to operate in those conditions with some extreme engineering ingenuity and extreme materials, but at 30G it starts to become very challenging to find materials and mechanisms that can do the job. Extracting Material From The Surface Perhaps just as importantly, getting materials that are being mined/harvested from the surface to a livable orbit would require immense amounts of energy because escape velocity would be so high. The escape velocity formula is sqrt(GM/r). For exoplanet KOI-423b, escape velocity is about 21 times that of Earth. Kinetic energy scales as the square of velocity, so it would take about 441 times as much energy to get a given mass of something off the surface of it as it would to get it off Earth. To get something off Earth and into orbit, you need about 50MJ/kg in round numbers. To get something off exoplaent KOI-423b, you would need about 22,050 MJ/kg. So, you would need 500 kg of chemical fuel for each 1 kg of material you wanted to get off planet, and would need more if you couldn't convert all of the fuel into kinetic energy creating velocity instantly and with perfect efficiency. Otherwise, the only way you could get enough energy to get materials off planet would be with a controlled nuclear reaction. Basically, you'd need to put the materials you want to retrieve on top of a small nuclear bomb. Indeed, one ugly but potentially effective approach to mining something close to the surface of this planet would be to launch a missile deep into the surface so it penetrated below the material you are looking for, and then detonate a nuclear bomb it was carrying which would spew raw materials into low exoplanet orbit, where it could be gathered up for processing by less extremely engineered robots. Conclusion There is no way that humans could settle on this planet, or that this planet could have habitable conditions on its surface. It might be possible to have a tolerable gravity and conditions on a small natural or man made moon orbiting a planet. I would imagine one that always had the same side facing the planet, because at the right distance from the planet, so that the planet could provide the right gravity and could pin an atmosphere and water that the moon otherwise couldn't hold to itself in place, ideally within a steep crater facing away from the planet that would prevent the atmosphere or water from leaking over the edge and falling back down to the planet. (I'm analyzing this scenario more carefully in light of a comment to confirm that this might be possible. But, certainly some moon or asteroid or space station in the vicinity of the planet, in some configuration, could be habitable.) Exploiting resources on the surface of the planet, which would be uninhabitable, might be possible with robots or drones, although it would be at the limited of extreme engineering to manage one that could handle those conditions, and would be extremely costly to remove from the planet in terms of energy requirements to get the materials to orbit. So, this would only be worthwhile for something that was very hard to find elsewhere and was otherwise extremely expensive and difficult to synthesize (e.g. crown jewel sized diamonds). 

An interesting new study looks at the question of how different genetically two populations have to be in order to uncontroversially constitute separate species and how similar they must be to uncontroversially constitute different populations of one species, empirically, by looking at the amount of genetic differences between populations where species status is controversial. 

They could try, but they would probably fail. This border would be longer than the U.S.-Mexico border and would be in much more habitable territory so there wouldn't be a natural desert barrier for most of it. It also doesn't take much of a boat to cross. A somewhat similar concept is explored in the book "The Water Knife" by Paolo Bacigalupi, set in the near future of the American Southwest, in which U.S. states exist and are subject to the federal courts but are allowed (or at least not prevented from) establishing border controls as refugees flee from places that droughts have made uninhabitable to neighboring states, enforced with volunteer militias supported by state governments or various water authorities. The trouble with a quarantine line that big is that even a 99.99% successful barrier would not be enough to prevent a disease from spreading because the contagion of the 0.01% of attempts that make it past the line would be enough to render the entire effort more or less futile. Another literary precedent is "Red Moon" by Benjamin Percy, in which part of the United States becomes controlled by werewolves in a scenario a bit like the one envisioned by the anti-mutant political movement in the X-Men universe. 

The division of India was notable for being conducted by an outside "expert" based upon demographic data. It was very bloody but at least was short lived compared to the long running insurgencies associated with most ethnic divisions. But, disputes over the border in Kashmir remain to the present day and were the source of violent insurgency for a prolonged period. Breaks Along Ethnic Lines Splits along ethnic lines rather than from the collapse of a central government that frees all member top level subdivisions are almost always preceded by long, violent military insurgencies. 

The more important question is not why they didn't choose to advance their technology. There are people like the Amish who do so today for a variety of religious and philosophical reasons. It it is a common trope that people reject technology after getting a bad taste in their mouth from excess technology use in the past leading to bad results. Both Frank Herbert's Dune series and the Star Wars series utilize similar tropes for rejecting certain kinds of technologies that were once common. The harder question, instead, is how they would manage to survive fifty years when other people are using advanced technology and they are not, in a situation where there is no state or a failed state with warlords. Realistically, they'd either need a patron of some kind, perhaps serving as a tributary defeated tribe of a more advanced tribe that protects them, or nobody is challenging them because they fear that they will be infected or harmed somehow by coming into contact with them. 

The distinction is between a "federal" system of government and a "unitary" one. Both have been tried, some of have been toggled between, and there are pros and cons to each. For example, France historically had a unitary government in which prefects appointed by the central government had authority over issues that are provincial or local government tasks in many other countries. For example, if you wanted to change the speed limit on the road through your village you would need approval from the local prefect and would have to lobby a member of the national parliament to make that happen. In the 1980s or so, it switched to having regional governments with internally elected officials. Benefits of Unitary Government One benefit of unitary government is that resources aren't wasted on meta issues of deciding which level of government handles which issue. Another benefit of unitary government is that it is less prone to NIMBY issues in which local governments adopt policies that have negative externalities or prevent something that is useful to the nation from being located anywhere at all. For example, Japan's unitary government has been noted for having better land use regulation than countries that vest that responsibility at the local level. A third benefit may be that the supply of competent potential elected officials and senior government officials may be scarce. Your nation may have enough competent people to serve in elected office and senior government offices to run one national government reasonably well, but not enough to run dozens of provincial governments as well. More generally, if the most competent elected officials and government officials are in the national government, then important policy decisions are made by the most competent people available. A fourth benefit is that it is easier for people new to democracy to understand a unitary system than a more elaborate federal system. A fifth benefit is that policy changes can be imposed nationwide very rapidly. But, the downside is that getting a policy change to happen may be harder with a national legislature to convince and greater inertia than with a smaller provincial body to convince. It also makes it easier to research the law that will apply to anything (especially interstate commercial ventures) if you have only one body of law to review. A sixth benefit is that there may be some provinces where the locals are prone to elect unwise provincial leaders who would adopt bad policies. But, their voice is diluted in a national government so their bad policies are not implemented. Benefits of Federalism One of the practical purposes of a provincial level of government is to prevent too much of importance from riding on a national government deadlock. For example, in the United States, now and then, there is government shutdown because a majority in Congress cannot agree on a budget. If all government activity depends upon that budget, then all government activity comes to a screeching halt, nationwide, when there is a failure to agree on a budget. But, if lots of important stuff is funded at the provincial level, then only the stuff funded at the national level stops nationwide when there is a failure to agree on a budget. Of course, there could be a failure to agree on a budget at a provincial level too. But, only one province is affected at a time. Similar logic applies in the case of a strike by a public employees union. A somewhat related concept is that smaller bureaucracies may simply be easier to manage. A second purpose of a provincial government is the serve as a "minor league" training ground for future national parliamentarians and senior government officials. Rather than electing novices to the national government, voters selecting national elected officials and national governments selecting senior executives can choose from people who have distinguished themselves in their service in very similar positions at the provincial level if they wish to do so, and novices serving in provincial government do less harm. A third purpose of provincial government is to put more of government into the hands of governments that aren't truly sovereign. A sovereign government has no "safety net" of higher level judicial officials and legislators to correct them if they take action that is beyond the realm of acceptable political conduct. Provincial government officials recognize that they can't start wars, change boundaries, change the national constitution, or violate their own constitutions and get away with it in the manner that national governments do. There are plenty of people who have something worthwhile to contribute to the policy process who shouldn't be trusted around the power to make war, for example. This feature also means that most national officials, having been trained to act within limits in the "minor leagues" are less likely to push beyond those limits when they eventually take national office. A fourth purpose, usually put higher on the list by political scientists, is that different provinces can have different policies. For example, gun control restrictions that might make sense of a highly urbanized province might not make sense for a province in a huge arctic desert where police are not readily available and wild animals are a genuine concern. Or, different provinces might have different ethnic and religious makeups that call for different policies - one province might regulate alcohol very strictly while another might allow it rather freely, for example. The differences need not be strictly differences of policy either. For example, if residents of one province speak French and residents of another province speak German, it may be useful to have two different provincial governments even if they are applying a single set of laws.
