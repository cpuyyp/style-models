I would spray the DEET on your clothes in places where the dogs won't lick, such as the top of a hat. I would also suggest trying to avoid using DEET by wearing long pants and sleeves to avoid the number of mosquitos trying to bite you. It also worth pointing out that since this is a known problem, people have developed mosquito repellents that are designed to be safe for use around dogs. Cats are a different story entirely and sometimes dog safe doesn't mean cat safe. See this article and this one. It's also worth listing the symptoms of DEET poisoning, 

Sometimes due to a high ridge or other land feature, the time that the sun comes over the horizon and gives direct sunlight is different from the time calculated by a sunrise table. From personal experience it can be up to several hours later. Is there a way to at least estimate the time of direct sunlight? 

Source and Felinae is basically everything else. A not quite complete description is that Panthera cats roar while Felinae cats purr, but that not entirely accurate as the snow leopard is unable to roar. 

Sometimes when setting up rock climbs for people you will have climbers of various abilities and yet not have enough resources to set up enough climbs so that everyone has something that is hard enough to keep the interested. In a case like this, are there any ways to make a rock climb harder for the the more skilled climbers to keep the interested? 

One of the more common knots in climbing is the figure eight on a bight (being tied on a bight means that it is tied without using the ends. How exactly would one tie this knot? 

The other important distinction is that females will travel with kittens while males are more solitary except for mating. Juvenile males can be the same size as an adult female. For pictures here are some of a melted out track (we were probably 6-7 hours after the lion went through) of a smaller mountain lion.

You don't want to store it in place where it would get moldy, so the less humidity the better. For the caribineers, According to REI, 

Source With my tactical flashlight I can pick up the reflections from animal eyeballs at over 300 yards and being able to spot a bear or other creature at that distance would be a definite asset in avoiding an encounter. I can say for certain that animals are sensitive to light and don't like it getting shined in their eyes and sometimes they will move away from you. 

Sometimes landmarks that you are travelling from, are much easier to take bearings to than what you are travelling towards. For example, in southern Utah near Bryce Canyon, there is a cinder cone that rises several hundred vertical feet above a relatively flat forest. Taking a bearing to the cinder cone is easy since it rises well above the forest. Navigating away is harder since there aren't any landmarks in front of you to see. However, it would be possible to take a bearing from your position back to the cinder cone, and thereby be able to tell whether or not you are on course or have strayed to the right or left of it. It would look like this, 

It is good practice on a hiking or backpacking trip to leave a written plan behind with someone. Then if you fail to return by your estimated date Search and Rescue will have an idea of where to look for you. Besides the your expected return date, what should go in your written plan and how detailed should it be? 

For packaging dehydrated foods for backpacking, the two options that I can think of are mylar bags, and vacuum sealed bags. What are the pros and cons of each method? 

I am going to say that the tree belongs to the Catalpa family. Here is a picture of the green bean pods. 

I don't think there is a general guideline, however I did find a guide by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations that has the calculations. The calculations for a Great White are on page 38, and the directions for the calculations start at page 13. I wish I could find a simple rule of thumb, but it looks like there is a good bit of math involved. 

Wild strawberries are very tasty, but I have only ever found them by accident. What locations would be good starting points to look for them? 

It takes a lot of energy for a bird to migrate, and comes with numerous risks, so if it is possible for it to stay where it is, not migrating can give it an evolutionary advantage. An example would be Canadian geese who live year round in Florida. I think that it depends a lot on the area and species, all of the hummingbirds in Wyoming would migrate with or without food, but the geese in Denver, CO stay all year round and are regarded as pests. As to whether its right or wrong to feed the birds, I think that's up to the individual's judgement, and one feeder would be a drop in the bucket. 

Source so it is probable that the other person would hear the shot. It is likely that it would be a rumble and not a single noise since there are lots of surfaces to bounce off of in a cave. Beyond that it would be hard to say, since people usually don't shoot inside of caves. The noise level would be higher and that could result in damaged hearing. 

I have a hydration bladder with a screw on the drinking hose, and the problem is that given enough time it will come unscrewed and then leak inside my backpack. I have tried tightening it as hard as I dare, (everything is made of plastic) and it still eventually comes loose. I could live with a permanent solution, since its fairly uncommon to have to remove the hose, and yet I would prefer something that can be undone if possible. How can I keep the hose on my hydration bladder from unscrewing? 

What I would suggest is that you practice leading routes that you have done without leading many times. As you have found out, taking the sharp end of the rope adds an extra amount of difficulty, both mentally and physically. I would do the route over and over again until you know all of the moves and are confident in your ability to climb it without falling. Then I would reattempt leading it. 

I just found that I can get free geological map overlays for Google Earth for all of the individual states in the United States from here. For instance, this is what a good deal of Yosemite National Park looks like. 

Source It seems like they will go inside a person's house to get food, or to get out of the cold or just out of curiosity. They do pose a danger to very small humans, but that type of behavior is rare. 

If I am trying to find out which way is north at night, and I can see stars, but not the North Star or the Southern cross or other recognizable constellations, because the terrain is limiting my view, how can I do so? 

The process for using a axe/hatchet is pretty similiar, except that you are trying to swing the axe into the middle of it hard enough to split it. Beyond that it just takes practice and some brute strength to pound through. Once you can identify the weak points and hit the wedge everytime you are probably good to go. As for how hold, I would say once someone is mature enough to be careful and big enough to swing the hammer then they could do it. 

Its not that it won't catch you, its that if you are outside of your lane it will cause a pendulum fall and you might swing into someone else or the wall. As it is their gear and climbing outside your lane will cause extra wear and tear, in addition to causing risk to other people, the courteous thing to do is to respect the rules and stay inside your climbing lane. A better solution to the boredom caused by repetitive climbing would be to ask the staff if they could change the holds on the routes. 

Yes, tumplines do have advantages over a regular backpack, and that includes being able to carry more weight. 

The more common way of belaying is called PBUS which stands for Pull, Under, Brake, Slide. What is the correct way to do this (including illustrations)? 

If one looks at the list on Wikipedia of fatal attacks, one will notice that fatal cougar attacks are pretty rare. 

Inspired by this question, how dangerous are alligators to people out canoeing in say the Everglades in Florida? I am sure there is some danger because from time time you here about people winning Darwin awards by going swimming with alligators What precautions should one take if canoeing in places with alligators? 

I spent one really miserable night because I found out during the rainstorm that my bivy sack wasn't waterproof. Drying it out wasn't an option because of the rain and moving some where else also wasn't an option because of the terrain. My temporary solution was to sleep in my rain gear (pants and jacket) inside my sleeping bag, is there a better solution for a situation like this? 

It turns out that raw eggs need to be either sealed or rotated, the people in the video were doing both. 

Trick question! The angles are identical. You see, if we have our two points on the map and know the angle between the bearing from us to them, then we can use that information to find the circle that runs through our position and through those two points. To define the circle, we need to find its center and its radius. The easiest way to find the center is to find the point where the angle forms a right triangle with the two points. The center will be at the exact half of the hypotenuse (green line). Or one could do it twice from both sides and where the hypotenuses cross is the center. 

The simple solution is to take the rope (both strands if rappelling on a doubled rope) below the device and wrap the several times around your upper leg and hold your upper leg perpendicular to the ground (this keeps the rope from slipping off). It's not particularly comfortable and you don't want to do it for an extended amount of time, but as a stopgap measure it works quite well. To getting going again, point your leg towards the ground and unwrap the rope. 

As far as how often to rotate, that will depend on how serious the failure of a particular component is. For instance, it would be far more critical to replace an epi-pen after exposure to really high heat than band-aids. 

Sometimes climbers/mountaineers will say that they are getting an alpine start. What does this mean and why would they want to do this? 

There are a lot of mountaineering routes that go up the downwind side of a mountain. Like the CMC route on Mt. Moran in the Tetons or the Gooseneck Glacier route on Gannet Peak. The added danger of a route like this is that weather could build up on the upwind side, out of sight and then roll in with very little warning. While camped on the CMC route, halfway up the mountain, a thunderstorm rolled in with maybe ten minutes of warning. Are there good ways to predict incoming weather without the ability to see the clouds coming? 

Bears would leave vertical scratch marks, and porcupines eat the outer bark as well, and the height rules out deer so that really leaves just the squirrels. The time of year also plays a part as bear damage typically happens during the spring while squirrels do this in late winter. Squirrels will strip trees so that they can line their nests and get to the tasty under bark. 

In the absence of lead, it is possible to use gravel or pieces of metal, as was done by various tribes in the American West, but it will damage the flintlock. As recorded by Capt. Meriwether Lewis (of Lewis and Clark fame), 

We have a question here about how common assaults/crime happen to people hiking the Appalachian Trail which I have answered with basically all of the statistics I could find. However it doesn't seem to me that one can judge the safety of something by the numbers when the risk is going to vary considerably by the person and by the actions they take. See this XKCD that illustrates quite well what I am talking about. 

From Chapters 6 and 7 of the book Touching the Void by Joe Simpson, there are two things that I think would explain why he didn't cut the rope. 

The most efficient way to run and pick up trash would probably be to know where the garbage cans along the route are so you can carry the trash for as little time as possible. At least according to this Fitness.SE answer , its not a good idea to run with hand weights, since there is little physical gain and danger of hurting your joints. If you were optimizing for most trash picked up, you would want to slow down and walk and look carefully, using a picker and a pail or maybe a shovel cause humans can be rather disgusting. From lots of experience of cleaning up trash, speed and thoroughness don't happen at the same time.
