In the city, it's best to "take the lane" and behave like traffic. However, on country roads, I prefer to do the following. When you hear/notice a car approaching, weave out about a meter into the road, then weave back. Repeat this a couple times, until the car is very close, then just hold your line on the edge of the road. The car will worry that you might weave again, and give you ample room. 

I have heard rumors that (excessive) stretching can hurt cycling performance. Specifically, stretching one's hamstrings and/or quadriceps supposedly reduces sprinting power. Is there any factual basis for the claim that increased flexibility leads to less power? I would also be interested in evidence for the opposite: that loosening one's muscles leads to an increase in cycling performance. Note, I am not referring to over-stretching related injuries (like a strain), but rather to the results of long-term, correctly-practiced stretching that leads to increased flexibility. 

The main idea is to keep scabs from forming. Scabbing retards the healing process greatly, and will increase scarring. The Neosporin that was suggested above and other generic antibiotic ointments help with this; this is an economical solution. You can get gauze that is already impregnated with Neosporin-like things, or you can apply the ointment to the wound and then put regular gauze on top. For large areas, it can be hard to keep the bandage on the wound which is why I recommend other products like Tegaderm. Tegaderm and similar products that are designed for burn victims work great. The nice thing about tegaderm is that you can stick it on the rash (once it's clean) and then leave it on there. It stays on the wound without needing tape or other adhesives, but it doesn't pull or damage the healing skin when/if you pull it off. It forms a protective "skin-like" layer while the skin underneath grows back. You can leave it on for a long time without changing, and it speeds the healing immensely. 

There are lots of different field tests approaches. I've been using the Carmichael one (two 9-minute full out TTs with a cooldown between them). 

For a given person at a given point in time, it is possible to determine what you are asking experimentally; for example, a runner can, over time, figure out their speed for different time periods. 

Tubular tires are very common in cyclecross; their construction and the way they mount to the rim make it possible to run a lower tire pressure. 

I doubt you will find a way to do this; it would require a shoe with a pretty deep sole to recess the cleats into (that's what SPDs do). Note that the SPD-SLs are pretty similar to the Looks but much more walkable. 

Well, the simple answer is that aerobars aren't very helpful unless you are riding at reasonable speed (say, >18MPH or so), but most people who ride at that speed would prefer to ride in a paceline, which gives more benefit than aerobars. Aerobars are unsafe in pacelines because riders cannot maneuver as well as being on the drop bars. 

I may have missed it in this thread but what kind of bicycle is it? If it's something like a Raleigh or a Peugeot or the like, it may be worth it in terms of both riding and getting the mechanical experience. If it's the 70's equivalent of a Huffy I'd pass mostly because that quality of a bike is virtually impossible to ever get adjusted properly and mechanically speaking, it's likely that you will become frustrated. Assuming that it's a decent bike, I say go for it! I've worked on and restored older bicycles and it's very rewarding. The initial investment of buying essential tools will absolutely make it worth it if you plan on doing more. The parts will likely be more expensive than the value of the bike, but again, gained experience and the satisfaction that comes from doing it is well worth it. 

I swear by the seats that have a hole in the center. Terry was the original but now other manufacturers make them as well. I have used them for years. Even with tons of gel the fragile parts are still going to be in direct contact with the seat and that hurts. If you do go that route, you'll have to adjust it a little here and there to make sure that it's doing what it's supposed to. 

You can work on a pedal stroke that applies pressure for a larger portion of the rotation of the pedals. That will reduce the peak force that is causing the wheel to lift. 

RideWithGps.com does exactly what you want; you can plot a route ahead of time and it will show you the elevation profile. 

You will not lose climbing strength if you work on your cadence; they are two different aspects of riding. My recommendation to increase cadence range is the following: 1) On a slight incline, choose a gear that is medium effort. 2) Over 30 seconds, increase your cadence until you are at your maximum smooth cadence (no bouncing). If your effort is too light, you need a higher gear; if it's too hard, you need a lower gear. 3) Hold for 30 seconds 4) Slow your cadence down for 30 seconds. Repeat three times. Do this once a week. This is primarily a neuromuscular exercise, so you don't need to do this too much. 

Your options to reduce the force on your knees are to reduce bike + rider weight or get lower gearing. If you have a standard road bike cassette, there are climbing cassettes that will reduce the gearing slightly (around 10% or so). Is it dangerous to your knees? Well, that depends on your personal physiology, how much force you are pushing, how much to you have trained for this, and how well your bike fits you. If you can do this without your knees hurting, you are probably fine. You might also consider standing up; this changes the mechanics a bit and mixes things up. When you stand up, make sure you slow down or you will spike your heart rate. Welcome to the steeps! 

It sounds dangerous to me on two fronts. First of all, you don't know who you're encountering and how you will be received. It really could go south if the person is at all hostile or has had a lousy day. Secondly, to be on your bike and attempt to open a door, even if your feet are on the ground sounds foolhardy. The car starts to move and you are down! Road rash at very best. And of course, I can't imagine that it's at all legal. 

I have no idea if it's efficient or powerful but I do know that ever since I was a kid right up until now it is pure FUN to pedal as fast as I can, get as much speed as I can, and then see how far it it carry me. Simple arithmetic. 

When my daughter was around three, we started out with the trailer bike and then graduated to a tandem with the pedals adapted. She had been on training wheels on her own little bike since she was two and was doing just fine; being on the trailer bike gave her an opportunity to go places, to feel like a big kid and to develop an appreciation for what cycling can offer. For me, I saw it as an opportunity to be exposed to cycling but even better, it was lots of fun for us both. Sometimes she would pedal, other times not so much. It didn't really matter. In short order, she was riding her own bike but we continued to use the trailer bike until she was eight when we graduated to the tandem. She would pedal along, talking the whole way, and of course, on the hills, I was on my own. Again, the bottom line was that we had tons of fun and traveled many miles in that way. Now at 27, she lives in the Boston area. She sold her car and uses her bike as her primary mode of transportation. I seriously doubt that she would have even considered selling her car if she hadn't had that kind of exposure and had developed such positive feelings about cycling. So, the moral of the story is that perhaps you could see the trailer bike primarily as a way of showing your kid the possibilities as opposed to a way to learn. Much less anxiety for both of you! 

Carbon fiber is strong. Really strong. The kinds of loads that your frame sees when you hit a pothole is far bigger than what you would get sitting on the bike. 

It's fairly simple; to stop effectively, you need to apply the two controls in a different manner. When you start braking, you have a given amount of weight on the front and rear wheels. As you apply the brakes, the deceleration shifts weight from the rear wheels to the front wheels, which gives more traction at the front, and less traction at the rear. More traction at the front means that you can apply the brakes more there, less traction at the rear means that you need to reduce the power on the rear brake. When I used to teach motorcycle safety, we would say "progressive squeeze on the front brake, light to lighter pressure on the rear". 

The difference between 28 and 30 is only about 8%. If you climbed a hill at 70 RPM on a 28, you would only be riding at 75% on a 30, and your force would only go down a little bit. 

I've been experimenting with the whole cold/sweat/wool/plastic bag dilemma and I think that I may have found another way to go about it. Yesterday, I put one of those toe warmers that you stick to the toe part of your insole. I put on a pair of medium weight wool socks. My feet sweat like crazy like always but they were pretty warm, even when I'd stop. I would recommend wearing a thick wool sock however: one of my feet started to get too hot because of the sweat combining with the insert. 

I have been trying to get a lock ring off of an old wheel. I have the correct cassette removal tool and (homemade) chain whip. I've gone so far as to use a vise but to no avail. I'm attempting to turn it counter clockwise. One thing that really confuses me is that I've seen bike mechanics and videos online where they put it on the vise and turn it counterclockwise but in my reality it spins. Any thoughts? I've always worked with freewheels so I very well may be attempting to do something that applies to them and not cassettes.
