which does the type III case. The point is that $S^{-1}(q)=S^\ast(q^\ast)$, which is what the diagram on p84 in the mentioned article says. 

Regarding the general question, from the point of view of conformal field theory there is a rather trivial way to obtain (some) $D^\omega(G)$. Namely, the representation category of the $G$-orbifold of a holomorphic (trivial representation category) rational conformal field theory is $\mathrm{Rep}(D^\omega(G))$ for some $[\omega]$, see Corollary 3.6. in $URL$ But I have now idea if as Scott pointed out as a comment all finite groups $G$ (I suppose yes) can be obtained this way; one has to find a holomorphic theory with an action of $G$, for example the Moonshine CFT for the Monster group etc. Then for a given $G$ I also have no idea which $[\omega]$ arise this way. I think it also follows conversely, that if a CFT has $\mathrm{Rep}(D^\omega(G))$ as representation category, then it is a $G$-orbifold of a holomorphic theory. But then I don't understand the non-holomorphic examples the op mentioned. In the non-holomorphic examples you have to mod something out to become (the dual of) $D^\omega(G)$ 

Let $X$ be an Abelian variety defined over a number field $K$, suppose that it has a good reduction over a fine place $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$. Let $G_{\mathfrak{p}}$ be the local Galois group for $K_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Let $s$ be a Hodge cycle in $H^n_{B}(X^{an}, \mathbb{Q})$, the Betti cohomology. By comparison theorem there is a canonical isomorphism $H^n_{B}(X^{an}, \mathbb{Q})\otimes \mathbb{Q}_p\cong H^n_{et}(X,\mathbb{Q}_p)$, where the right hand side of the equation is the etale cohomology. So via this isomorphism, $s$ corresponds to a etale cycle $s_{et}$. Then Does Deligne's absolute Hodge theory implies that $s_{et}$ is fixed by a finite index subgroup of $G_{\mathfrak{p}}$. 

I am a little confused about the log structure of Witt ring and its Frobenius map. Let $k=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_p$, $W:=W(k)$ the Witt ring. We know that to deal with the semistable reduction, i.e. scheme over $W$ etale locally of the form $X=Spec(W[x_1,\cdots, x_d]/(x_1\cdots x_d-p))$, if we want to say that $X$ is log smooth over $W$, we need the following log structure $(Spec(W),M,\alpha)$, $\alpha : M=W\setminus\{0\}\hookrightarrow W$. However, we know that $W$ has the Frobenius map $\sigma$, the corresponding map on the monoid $M$ is the restrction of $\sigma$ on $W\setminus \{0\}$. If we consider the closed point of $Spec(W)$, such that $(Spec(k),N, \beta)\hookrightarrow (Spec(W),M,\alpha)$ is exact closed immersion, then the log structure $N$, is the following $N=(k\setminus\{0\})\oplus \mathbb{N}$, and $\beta: N\to k$, is defined as follows; $(b,0) \to b$ and $(b,n)\to 0$, for $n>0$, $b\in k\setminus\{0\}$. We then see that the Frobenius map $\sigma$ induced a map on $(Spec(k),N, \beta)$, which on the underying scheme is just the usual power $p$ map on $k$. But the map on the monoid is the direct sum of power $p$ map and identity map , i.e. $N\to N$, $(b,n)\to (b^p,n)$, which is different from the absolute Frobenius map. Because we know that for any log scheme $(Y,L)$, the absolute Frobenius map on the monid $L$ is just the power $p$ map, i.e. $l\to p\cdot l$. On the other hand , when deal with absoulte (relative )Frobenius map, people ususally consider the trivial log structure on $W$ and $k$. So does it means that one can not deal with semistable reduction and Frobenius at the same time ? For example, if one want to generalized the calssical Cartier Descend theorem over smooth curve (which said that a vector bundle with connection is come from Frobenius pull back iff its $p$- curvature vanishing ) to node curves, one will have problem? 

I don't have any book in front of me at the moment, so I am a bit improvising here, but you'll find this in eg. Reed Simon 2, Streater Wightman, or Josts book. Let us call the map $$E:{\cal D}(\mathbb{R}^2)\to H=L^2(H_m,d\Omega_m)\qquad f \mapsto \hat{f}|_{H_m}.$$ I claim that already $E(\mathcal D(O))$ with $O$, let's say, compact with non-trivial interior is dense in the Hilbert space, where $\mathcal D(O)$ are the smooth functions with support in $O$. Let us take a vector $v\in H$ orthogonal to $\mathcal D(O)$, i.e. $(v,E(\mathcal D(O)))=0$. We have to show that $v=0$ for which it is actually enough to show that $(v,E(\mathcal S(\mathbb R))=0$, because the Schwartz functions are dense. Now let us define the map $$ T:\mathcal S(\mathbb R^2) \to H: f \mapsto T(f):=(v,E(f)) $$ which turns out to be continous, i.e. a tempered distribution. We have to show that $T=0$. The Fourier transform of this distribution has support on the forward light cone (even on the mass shell), so it turn out that $T$ is the boundary value of an analytic function $\tilde T$ on $\mathcal T=\mathbb R^2+ i V_+$ (this depends a bit on your convention) where $V_+$ is the forward light-cone. It means that $$T(f) = \lim_{\mathcal T \ni z\to 0} \int_{\mathbb R^2} \tilde T(x+z)f(x)\mathrm dx.$$ But because $T \restriction_{\mathcal D(O)}=0$ it follows that $\tilde T \restriction_O=0$. By the edge of the wedge theorem $\tilde T \equiv 0$ on whole $\mathcal D$ and therefore $T=0$, what we wanted to show. 

F.Kato has a statement said that a log smooth curve $f:(X, M,\alpha)\to (k,N,\beta)$ where $k$ is an algebraic closed field and $N$ is some fine log structure on $k$, is equvalent to pointed node curve in a paper "Log sooth deformation and moduli of log smooth curves". I am quite confused with the log structure $N$ on k, when one associate a log smooth curve to a pointed node curve. Let's consider the following example, $X$ has only one double point $x$, and only one marked point $s$, and $x\neq s$. Let $A=k[t_1, t_2]/(t_1t_2)$, $U=Spec (A)$ be an etale neighborhood of $x$ , with $x= (0,0)$, we see that the log structure over $U$ is defined by the following $\alpha:M_U:=k^*\oplus N^2 \to A $ by $\alpha(k_1,n_1,n_2)= k_1t_1^{n_1}t_2^{n_2}$, and the log structure $N:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ and the map $\beta:N\to k $ defined by $\beta(k_1,0)=k_1$, and $\beta(k_1,n)=0$ for $n>0$. The map $f$ on the monoid is defined by the following $f^0:N\to M_U$, $f^0(k_1,n)=(k_1,n,n)$. On the other hand Let $B=k[T]$ , $V=Spec(B)$, be an etale neighborhood of $s$, with $s=(0)$. Then the log structure on V is $M_V:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ with $\alpha(k_1,n)=k_1T^n$. Now F. Kato claimed one extend $M_U$, $M_V$ to $X$, and define $M:=M_U\oplus_{\mathcal{O}^{\times}_{X}} M_V$, then $(X, M, \alpha)$ is log smooth over $(k, N, \beta)$. My question is how to define the map $f^0 : N\to M$ on the monoid? Over $U$, it is already given above. But what about over V, it seem that it is impossible to define such a map, for one need to satisfy the following relation: $ \alpha\circ f^0= i\circ \beta$, where $i: k\to k[T]$ is the natural map. And one fine that $\alpha\circ f^0(k_1, n)=i(0)=0 $ for $n>0$, however $0\notin Imge( \alpha)$, so it is impossible to define $f^0$. 

At the end of Section 14.1 in Pressley, Segal "Loop Groups" there is the remark that the partition function is a modular function in the sense that the Dedekind $\eta$ function is a modular form. I am interested about the following remark: 

(1) Let $\mathcal F$ be a spherical fusion tensor category. Then MÃ¼ger showed that $R=\bigoplus_{H\in\mathrm{Irr}(\mathcal F)} H\boxtimes H^\mathrm{op}$ canonically has the structure of a Frobenius algebra in $\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op}$ and that the category of bimodules ${}_R(\mathcal F \boxtimes \mathcal F^\mathrm{op})_R$ has a braiding which makes it a modular tensor category equivalent to $Z(\mathcal F)$. Further, the "dual" Frobenius algebra is $\hat Q=I(1)$, where $I$ is the induction functor, ie the adjoint of the forgetful functor $F\colon Z(\mathcal F)\to \mathcal F$. (2) Conversely, let $\mathcal C$ be a modular tensor category, then it is the center of a fusion category iff there is a Lagrangian algebra $A\in\mathcal C$, i.e. a commutative (Frobenius) algebra, such that $\dim A^2=\dim\mathcal C$. Namely, the right modules $\mathcal C_A$ have a tensor structure and $$Z(\mathcal C_A)=\mathcal C\cong\mathcal C\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal C_A^0}\cong \mathcal C\boxtimes \mathrm{Vect}\cong \mathcal C$$ Further, I conclude ${}_A\mathcal C_A\cong \mathcal C_A \boxtimes \mathcal C_A^\mathrm{op}$, because $\mathcal C_A^0\cong\mathrm{Vect}$. Question: Let $A\in\mathcal C$ be a Lagrangian algebra. I guess it is true that $A$ and $\hat A$ by (2) are in of the form as in (1), ie $A\cong I(1)$ and $\hat A\cong R$. Is there any reference for such a result, which is citable? Note: A special case when $\mathcal C \cong Z(\mathcal C_0)$ for $\mathcal C_0$ a unitary modular tensor category is contained implicitly in the subfactor literature $URL$ I am particular interested and most comfortable with the case of unitary tensor categories, so feel free to add the right adjectives. 

Let $X_1,X_2$ be two smooth proper schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, such that their reduction modulo $p$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes. Then is it true that the geometry etale fundamental groups $\pi_1^{alg}(X_1\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ and $\pi_1^{alg}(X_2\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ are isomorphic? 

everyone, I want to ask is there any result in the literature similar to the following: Let $ X=\mathbb{P}^1\backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$, then $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ denote the its generic fiber, and for any prime number $p$, $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}:= X_{\mathbb{Q}}\times Spec(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ be the base change to $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Consider the global section of log differntial form $\Omega_{X_{\mathbb{Q}}}(log(0,1,\infty))$. It has a basis $\{\frac{dz}{z},\frac{dz}{z-1}\}$ , where $z$ is the standard affine coordinate. The result is : For any global section of log 1-form $\omega=a\frac{dz}{z} + b\frac{dz}{z-1}$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, one can associate a system of representation of algebraic fundamental group. More explicitly, for any prime number $p$, such that $p\nmid a$, or $p\nmid b$, then one has a nontrivial rank two $\mathbb{Z}_p$-representation of $\pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})$, where $\pi_1^{alg}$ denote the algebraic fundamental group, that is $$ \rho_{\omega,p}: \pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})\to GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_p). $$ It has the following property: (i): the restriction of $\rho_{\omega,p}$ to the geometry $\pi_1$ is an nontrivial extension of two trivial representation, so when restricted to geometry $\pi_1$, it will never be trivial. (ii): If one has a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-point of $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, then the induced Galois represention of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is an extension of trivial representation and Tate twist $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$. I really want to know wether there is a trivial way to realize the above association. Thank you! 

Take $C$ to be the category of dualizable $N$-$N$-bimoduls, $N$ a factor. A subfactor $N\subset M$ (or $N_0\subset N$) with finite index and finite depth gives an algebra object $A$ in $C$, namely $A={}_NM_N$ (or ${}_NL^2M_N$ if you prefer) and conversely an algebra object (more precisely a Q-system) gives a subfactor $N\subset M$. Instead of building artificially a category of subfactors, you take the category of (simple) algebra objects (Q-systems) in $C$. Each finite group gives an object $A_G=\bigoplus_{g\in G} {}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ with $\alpha_g$ automorphisms on $N$ such that $\alpha_g\alpha_h=\alpha_{gh}$ for $g,h\in G$ and ${}_NN^{\circ\alpha_g}_N$ is ${}_NN_N$ seen as a $N$-$N$ bimodule, where the right action is composed with $\alpha$. A morphism $H\to G$ gives a morphism $A_H\to A_G$ between algebra object. This category contains also finite groups, their duals, Kac-algebras and weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. If you want irreducible subfactors, you ask $A$ to be haploid, then you lose weak-C${}^\ast$ Hopf algebras. This also tells you how a "category of subfactors" should work... 

There are modular tensor categories with central charge 0, which are not the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. Take the pointed modular tensor category $\mathcal C(\mathbb Z/{17}\mathbb Z,q)$ with $q(x)=\exp(16\pi i x^2 /17)$. It is easy to check that the metric group $(\mathbb Z/{17}\mathbb Z,q)$ has no Lagrangian subgroup, thus no Lagrangian algebra. The easiest way to see it is that $17$ is no square. This category is $\mathrm{SU}(17)$ at level 1 thus has central charge 16 which means topological central charge $0\pmod 8$. Another way to calculate the central charge is by calculating the Gauss sum.
