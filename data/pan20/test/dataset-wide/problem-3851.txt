In particular, I'm attempting to understand the integral cohomology on K3^[4], a Hilbert scheme on the projective K3 surface, and whether or not this compact Kaehler manifold admits a Kaehler form that represents an integral class. Unlike on K3 itself, here we have b_{2}=23, so the solution to this question isn't merely a matter of rescaling to achieve an integral Kaehler form. Would any of the experts here have any glimmerings of an approach to take here, or a useful paper/text to recommend? After plenty of browsing, I have found information about the integral cohomology on this manifold, but nothing addressing the feasibility of selecting a Kaehler form that represents an integral class. 

I'm seeking to understand the de Rham cohomology of a Hilbert scheme $K3^{[4]}$ of the K3 surface. By Beauville, this 8-dimensional compact manifold is Kaehler, irreducible, holomorphically symplectic (that is, it possesses a nondegenerate form $\rho$ of type (2,0)), and simply-connected. By the Kodaira Embedding Theorem, this manifold embeds in $CP^{N}$ for N sufficiently large, and hence, in particular, $K3^{[4]}$ admits a Kaehler form $\phi$ that represents an integral de Rham class (it is a projective manifold). As an algebraic-geometric novice, I am not aware of all the properties that extend from varieties to their schemes, but it makes sense that many would. Specifically, since Beauville generalized the Beauville-Bogomolov form $$q_{X,\omega}(\alpha):=n\int_{X}(\omega\bar{\omega})^{n-1}\alpha^{2}+(1-2n)\left(\int_{X}\omega^{n}\bar{\omega}^{n-1}\alpha\right)\left(\int_{X}\omega^{n-1}\bar{\omega}^{n}\alpha\right)$$ from compact, Kaehler, irreducible symplectic varieties to compact, Kaehler, irreducible symplectic manifolds, I'm wondering if a $q_{X,\omega}$-orthogonal decomposition applicable on varieties may also extend to the more general manifold case. The decomposition to which I'm referring is described in Proposition 22 from a paper by Martin Schwald, which may be found here: arXiv:1701.09069v1 [math.AG] 31 Jan 2017. I'll reproduce it here: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a 2n-dimensional, irreducible symplectic variety with normed Beauville-Bogomolov form $q_{X}=q_{X,\omega}, \omega\in H^{2}(X,\mathbf{C})$, and an ample class $a\in H^{2}(X,\mathbf{R})$. Restricting $q_{X}$ gives a real quadratic form $H^{2}(X,\mathbf{R})\rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ and $H^{2}(X,\mathbf{R})$ splits into the following $q_{X}$-orthogonal subspaces $$V_{+}:=\mathbf{R}\left<\omega+\bar{\omega},i\omega-i\bar{\omega},a\right>, V_{-}:=\{d\in H^{1,1}(X)\cap H^{2}(X,\mathbf{R})|q_{X}(d,a)=0\}$$ such that $q_{X}$ is positive definite on $V_{+}$, negative definite on $V_{-}$ and $dim_{\mathbf{R}}V_{+}=3$. By taking $\omega:=\rho$ and $a:=[\phi]$, I sense that perhaps this theorem may be adapted to $K3^{[4]}$, but if possible, I'd like to hear what some algebraic geometry experts here think about this idea. 

Do I misunderstand something, or such an easy argument works? 1. Assume that such set $S$ of $k$ points exists. Choose an arbitrary position of $C_1$ such that its center $O$ is not in $S$. The rest points inside $C_1$ are split into (open) semicircles (of possible circles $C_{11}$) joining $O$ with the boundary of $C_1$ and `facing clockwise'. Each such semicircle $c$ should contain an even number of points of $S$, otherwise the position of $C_{11}$ containing $c$ and that just a bit clockwise tp it contain numbers of points having different parities. Thus the total number of points inside $C_1$ is also even. REMARK. The condition of each semicircle $c$ containing an even number of points in $S$, along with the similar condition for counterclockwise semicircles, is equivalent to that of every $C_{11}$ containing a number of points in $S$ of fixed parity. Such examples can be easily constructed in many ways [here was a not-quite-correct explanation], one of which is shown in the picture below. A dashed circle contains an even number of green points, and while it rotates around the center it gets and loses an even number of them at every moment. Points distribution $URL$ 2. The same argument works for the general question about $C$, $C_1$, and $C_2$, unless the center $O$ of $C$ lies in $S$. As far as I understand, in this question you do not fix the radii of $C_1$ and $C_2$, otherwise an example from the Remark above can be completed by $O$ (In the picture below, there is an odd number of green points, counting the center). If the radii may vary and $O$ is in $S$, then one may choose $C_1$ and $C_2$ of equal radii so that they do not pass through other points of $S$, and then increase one radius and decrease the other so as to include $O$ inside $C_1$. 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb Z}$If $G\cong \ZZ/n\ZZ$, then the lattice $L(G)$ tells the number of prime factors of $n$ together their exponents, while $\mathop{\rm Aut} G\cong (\ZZ/n\ZZ)^*$, which can be decomposed into a direct product using the Chinese remainders theorem. Now it is easy to construct a counterexample. Since $(\ZZ/27\ZZ)^*\cong(\ZZ/19\ZZ)^*\cong\ZZ/18\ZZ$ and $(\ZZ/125\ZZ)^*\cong(\ZZ/101\ZZ)^*\cong\ZZ/100\ZZ$, we have $(\ZZ/(27\cdot 101\ZZ))^*\cong(\ZZ/(19\cdot 125\ZZ))^*$ and also $L(\ZZ/(27\cdot 101\ZZ))\cong L(\ZZ/(19\cdot 125\ZZ))$. 

You can read about this in many references, for example in Section Tag 06Y7. It also gives some refences. 

The henselian pair question is in a paper of Gabber "Affine analog of the proper base change theorem" footnote on page 326. See also Lemma Tag 09ZS. Please also look further in Gabber's paper where he discusses combining the henselian pair picture with the proper base change theorem. 

Suppose that $\mathcal{X}$ is an algebraic stack which is limit preserving on objects over $S$. Suppose that $U \to \mathcal{X}$ is a smooth surjective map from a scheme. Then $U \to S$ is limit preserving by the results of Section Tag 06CT. Thus $U$ is locally of finite presentation over S (for example by the reference you gave). This exactly means that $\mathcal{X} \to S$ is locally of finite presentation. I didn't check the direction you said was OK, but if it is, then this also means there is no difference between "limit preserving on objects" and "limit preserving" for algebraic stacks over schemes. There is a difference in general (for stacks in groupoids over schemes for example). Anyway, this is one of the many things missing from the Stacks project (thanks for pointing it out). The Stacks project takes contributions (by email or via git pull requests) if you are so inclined. 

There is a lot of work done about this by people such as Raynaud, Harbater, Stevenson, Bouw, Wewers, Osserman and others (please edit here if you want to add more). An example result very close to what you are looking for is Theorem 1.4 of the paper Linear series and existence of branched covers by Brian Osserman. You can also find the paper on the arxiv. 

You are certainly allowed to do this and you will get a right derived functor because you are looking at resolutions $G^\bullet \to I^\bullet$ (note how the arrow is pointing to the right!). This works because any two injective resolutions $I^\bullet$ of $G^\bullet$ are homotopy equivalent, so you can use this to compute the right derived functor of absolutely any functor. However, the derived tensor product is defined as a left derived functor. Maybe this will help: the derived tensor product can be computed by taking a K-flat resolution in either variable. Thus you can first take a K-flat resolution $F^\bullet \to F$ (if $F$ is a sheaf this can be just your usual bounded above complex of flat modules resolving $F$) and then $Tot(F^\bullet \otimes G^\bullet)$ computes the derived tensor product. You don't even have to replace $G^\bullet$; in fact, since now $F^\bullet$ is K-flat you can reoplace $G^\bullet$ by any quasi-isomorphic complex and you get the same answer in the derived category. 

$\let\eps\varepsilon$It is easier to consider a function $f(x)=-\log g(e^{-x})$. Then $f\colon (0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is still continuously differentiable and increasing (the bordering conditions are almost not in the game), and it satisfies $$ f((t+1)x)<f(tx)+f(x) \qquad (*) $$ for all $x\in(0,+\infty)$ and positive integer $t$ (I do not know why you set $t>1$...). Now let us consruct such an $f$ violating the desired condition. Firstly, we set $f(x)=x+\eps$ for a small $\eps>0$, so that it satisfies $(*)$. Next, we perturb $f$ in a small neighborhood of $x=5$ so that now $f(5)$ is slighly greater than $f(2)+f(3)$, thus violating the desired condition. Surely, now it also violates $(*)$, but this happens only for $x$ being in a small neighborhood of $5/2$, or for $x$ being almost in $(0,5/3)$ (or, recursively from $5/2$, for $x$ around $5/4$ and smaller ones). Thus, now it is easy to perturb $f$ in a neighborhood of $5/2$, and then simply to increase it on, say, $(0,\,1.9)$ so that it becomes, say, $1.1x+\eps$ on $(0,\,1.7)$. The details can be simply recovered. 

This is an improved version of the answer. The previous version (answering Q1 and Q2) is saved below. We show now that Q2b is equivalent to the question whether a finite set of translational Wang tiles may have an irrational supremum density of occurences of some tile in a tiling of the plane. By a translational Wang tiles we mean Wang tiles which can be only translated but neither rotated nor reflected. (Thus usual Wang tiles are a partial case.) $\underline{\Rightarrow}$. Assume that an irrational supremum density in our question may appear. Let $M$ be larger than the diameter of any prohibiting pattern. Cut the optimal arrangement into $M\times M$ squares, and call a $2M\times 2M$ square consisting of four such squares a tile (so neighboring tiles overlap by an $2M\times M$, $M\times 2M$, or $M\times M$ rectangle). Then any arrangement of tiles leads to a valid coloring iff the obvious rules how these tiles should be neighbored are satisfied; these rules simply tell which two tiles can be neighbors in which direction. One can easily see that such rules can be modelled by translational Wnag tiles (if needed, I may put more details, but I hope this is known). Finally, it is clear that some of these tiles should have an irrational density, if the total density is irrational. $\underline{\Leftarrow}$. Conversely, to each system of translational Wang tiles where sime tile may appear with an irrational maximal densiry we put into correspondence the set of patterns in a following manner. We want to construct a corresponding set of patterns. First of all, by a standard application of Koenig's lemma, it suffices to find arbitrarily large squares which may be colored with the density close enough to irrational $d$, and that no coloring has a density larger than $d$. To prove the lattter, we will use the Wang tiles condition. Choose a $k$ much larger than the maximal size of a pattern, an even $n$ much larger than $k$, and an even $N$ much larger than $n$. To each pattern, biject some $n\times n$ square so that (i) each square used contains either $d$ or $d+1$ black squares, and it contains all boundary cells; (ii) this square contains $d+1$ black cells if it is of a distinguished type; (iii) any two squares used differ, even if we delete at most $k$ black squares from each. Call the corresponding squares complete.
