Scientists can already "create" cell lines and mutant strains(single cells, drosophilia, zebra fish, worms like caerabinopsis elegans, dog, cats,...) by genetic recombination. Actually in your case, the "egg" implantation may work well because I guess that modifying just a few gene wont modify the compatibility of mother/mutant offspring that much. Note that only a few genes can alter strongly the phenotype (the appearance of your species or its ability and characteristics, like life span). In fact it was suggested to create a Mammoth embryo and implant it into a elephant. Humans have after all only 2% genetic differences with Chimpanzee. So to as an biologist, I would say 1 - genetic recombination and egg implantation should work if species are close enough (size matters usually). Taking into account immunological properties as suggested above may make it more believable. 2 - Alternative is to grow your species in a pod with embryonic fluid. Some tissues sheets can easily be grown in lab culture, and recently even some organs ! Artificial embryonic sacks are thus plausible in a close future, and could be used in various situations. 3 - if you want a single organism that create offsrping and evolve without any interaction with a male, it is absolutely possible. There exist several mode of "duplication" of the organisms. By Fission, you can separate the body into 2 (usually for microbes), Division and regenaration (in that case you have the same genome accros multiple generations), but if you want to create evolution and diversification within your species, you probably need a sexual species that can use auto-fertilization. Some intringing lizards and frogs species do it :) The change of sex mostly depend on environmental conditions, such as temperature. I suggest you to google evolutionary website to check the strange sexual reproduction modes. 

From a science point of view, yes, if life were discovered on Venus, there would be an immediate switch in priorities. Scientifically this would be huge. (And contrary to other answers, science rather than colonisation is the main reason for funding space missions in the current political climate.) It would be our first discovery of life anywhere away from Earth, so there would be a huge wave of media excitement and popular interest, and as a result, funding for space missions, especially Venus ones, would go up for a while. Scientists all over the world would be intensely excited to answer all sorts of questions about Venus life: did it arise independently of Earth life, or was life transported from one planet to another via meteorite impacts, which is thought to be possible? Does Venus life use the same amino acids and nucleic acids as Earth life, or is its chemistry completely different? How does life survive in the incredibly harsh environment on Venus, and how many places on the planet can it live? There is basically nobody in biology or planetary sciences who wouldn't immediately want to know all that. Then there's all the potential medical applications of a whole other biosphere full of biologically active molecules that are probably not found on Earth. So basically it's a no-brainer: there's no doubt that if this was discovered there would be at least one follow-up mission, perhaps several, designed specifically to study it. This would indeed quite likely involve cuts in funding for Mars missions, because that's just the way things work. These Venus missions would not be manned, due to Venus' thick corrosive atmosphere. This not only makes it extremely hard for even an unmanned spacecraft to last very long but also means that you can't blast off from Venus unless you manage to take something the size of a Saturn V with you and land it on the surface - that's currently quite some way beyond what humans are practically capable of. So these would be robotic missions with specifically designed experiments for studying Venusian biology. Perhaps people would consider a sample return mission - i.e. an unmanned spacecraft that picks up a sample and takes it back to Earth - though I would guess that would be unfeasible at our present stage of development. However, there is a big caveat to be mentioned. Life is thought to be very unlikely on Venus, due to the extremely high temperature and sulfuric acid rain - certainly no known Earth life can survive there. We can suspend disbelief and imagine that life finds a way to survive there anyway, but it also poses another problem: no probe sent to Venus in 2022 will include equipment to detect life, because nobody expects to find it there. Detecting life in non-Earth-like soil is hard - even the recent Mars probes don't carry equipment designed to do that, because it would be prohibitively expensive to do so. So the probe will not carry PCR equipment for detecting DNA; it will not carry an experiment to culture any bacteria it might happen to find, and it will not carry the microscope and special dyes that would be needed to attempt to observe cells directly. Even if the soil on Venus were teeming with as many bacteria on Earth, it would look as lifeless as Earth dirt to the rover's sensors. If you're really lucky a growing bacterial colony might be observed by the cameras, but it would just look like a small stain that changes slowly in size, and it would be impossible to be sure that that was actually life rather than just a chemical phenomenon. For these reasons, it's extremely unlikely that a near-future Venus rover would find life on Venus even if it were there - they only way I can think of it happening is if there is not just bacteria but actual complex multicellular life that can be directly and unmistakably observed by a camera. 

Genetic components & environmental pressures define sleep cycle. It is an interesting question, and as a cell biologist, I am convinced that the key point to answer it lies within the genetic component of the circadian rhythm and the "environment" that constraint the night/day cycle. If I may add, sleep do help the body to "take care of ourselves" (even we find it useless and unproductive!) and that brainwaves is maybe not the good answer to your question. Dsollen in your question you rightly introduce some results/consequence of sleep on evolutionary and social aspects (producing or finding food, raising young, finding mates, achieving dominance, higher social status, or more territory, vulnerability when asleep. nature of source of the sleep), but you must not forget that sleep is a long-evolved process which takes roots billions years ago during cell evolution - which evolution is based on night/day cycle as primary (and most stable) selection pressure. Billions of years after, this result in a fine-regulated circadian clock present within each of our cells. As you probably know, the circadian clock is encoded by genetic factors: the "core" genes working driving this circadian clock are now well known, and the network they define is quite intricate and complex. There is a lot of research going on about this topic, most of them rely on using engineered cells and mutants which possess a rather similar clock than human. The crucial point is that these genes drive the expression of many cell functions and biological processes, including: blood cell activity, immunology, cell migration, dna repair (thus tissue organization/regeneration), etc. I don't know any good scientific that review all of that at once-its in fact many papers-, but you may start with google scholar. In particular, I recommend the publications of Pierre Baldi, a research scientist of UC Irvine university I meet this year in conference in Japan. His research focuses on the molecular aspect of the circadian clock. For example, see this paper $URL$ These deep molecular and physiological implications I briefly introduced above apply at various scale within any species, and this will undoubtedly constrain the answer to your question. The putative evolution of shorter sleep in a sapient-like species is possible with specific mutations (as said above it was shown in humans), but evidence to say that there is no counter-effects are in my opinion still lacking, because it these research do not cover all physiological aspects and molecular levels (i.e., these people may have some defect at levels not measured yet, such as immunological resistance or tissue regeneration) Therefore, to shorten the sleep cycle also means increasing the risk of developing cancer and diseases: $URL$ but also may change the ability of this species to answer to pathogens and infections: $URL$ As it took millions of years for this system to evolve in simple then more complex organisms, with various complexity and scale, I can't conceive that we could suddenly (or over few years) "suppress sleep". Rather than that, I imagine that, in a putative fiction world or close future, that sleep may be "optimized" through appropriate genetic treatments and methods, assuming we got a better knowledge of the molecular processes at work by then. But in a naturally-evolved process, it may well take millions of year to evolve it to a more optimized circadian clock (and assuming the day/night cycle is not changed and still of importance). You may also imagine that in a world where the night/day cycle have very short nights, then you have about 100% chance that single-cells, then multi-cellular species will evolve in response to this environmental condition in their own specific way. Hope my answer is helpful, Best, Arno 

I'm surprised no-one's mentioned aerial warfare: with the stuff as described in the question, you could use it to fly high in the air. Of course, controlling altitude and velocity would be a major challenge, and the only way to come back down is to let go of some very expensive antigravity ballast, but still, it might be useful from time to time, for surveillance or for dropping bombs of some kind. 

It's a flightless bird As others have pointed out, a creature would not dive if it was unable to do so due to being too buoyant, and if it had no reason to. As for reasons for diving, one is to get food and another is to avoid attack from aerial predators. The latter reason is taken care of by the armour, but we have to ask why a surface-dwelling organism would evolve armour instead of evolving the ability to dive, which is probably the easier solution for most organisms. This is where buoyancy comes in. If the animal is very lightweight it will be hard for it to evolve diving behaviour, and it might take the armour strategy instead. Buoyancy means low density, i.e. light weight for the size. But why would an animal be so light weight? One obvious reason is flight. So: we have to imagine that this organism's ancestors were birds, or pterodactyls or similar flying creatures. Think of something like a large sea bird, though not necessarily a whale-sized one. It eats something that lives near the surface, so it doesn't need to dive very deep (if at all), and it spends a lot of its time resting on the water surface, using its feet to paddle like a duck or a swan. If food is very plentiful and predators are few, then birds will often lose the ability to fly. We just have to imagine that this happens here, resulting in a bird-like animal that spends all of its time paddling in the water, never taking to the air. (One difficulty is that a bird would need to lay its eggs on dry ground, but if this is not an Earth species we can imagine that it has live young instead. Or it could evolve a special body cavity in which to incubate its eggs or something - you'll have to be inventive here.) After that, we just need it to evolve its large size and armoured back. Sea animals seem to evolve a large size quite often. The reasons for this are not completely understood (though see here), but the same thing might well happen to a flightless sea bird. It would be easier for it to stay warm, it would have bigger fat reserves, and it would be so big that no predator could eat it. However, since it's sitting helpless in the water it could still be attacked by other aerial predators, who peck at its flesh without killing it. An armoured skin would be a sensible evolutionary response to this. 

At this rate it took 7 minutes to fill a 120 gallon tank, the next minute will fill a whole new tank, and the next minute will fill 2 tanks To summarize: at the 7th minute we have a filled tank at the 8th minute we have a new filled tank at the 9th minute we have two more new tanks Total of 4 tanks in 9 minutes, one in 7 minutes, one in 1 minute and two more in 1 minute. this rate can be a a solution for your problem. EDIT 2^33 = 8589934592 you can say the sun death was predicted in linear growth but that it actually is in exponential growth. Using the example from above changing a minute for a year, it will take 33 years. 

The exponential dilemma might be a good bet. lets say that there are 120 gallons per tank. lets say that we can fill twice the gallons to the tank in the same time that we did before, a minute. So that in the first minute we fill one gallon. 

Depends of his personality, if he lives forever or for very long times he might choose to enjoy the stupid phases of a human a little bit more because a person changes his attitudes depending on how many years left he thinks he has and how easily he gets tired or because he was very close to die or believes in something greater than himself Remember that most humans care most about the pleasures of life, and some don't want to stop enjoying but time makes them to do something meaningful before they die. Although years give you experience and experience can make you wiser, people like to have fun because its fun, imagine that it was impossible for a human to live more than 21 years, he would be very wise and giving the best of him at around 17-19. Do you think they would live with the same attitude like a 17 kid from today? But some young people have a personality of an old person. Sometimes personality and attitude count more to give the best of us than a skill or ability. If Einstein had lived 500 years we can say he would be the same because he always was like that and what he did was his pleasure. If a person who you don't like because of his actions lived forever do you think he would change his attitude at 100 years old? he might he might not. Most of the people tend to act according the judgement of society, look at him he is 45 and still not married, that person might want to get married, but if the youngest age to marry was at 120 in a world where people lived 800 years? more years give you more experiences for good or for bad. 

Here are some educated guesses from a physicist about what would happen if the Earth were split in two. I'm assuming that the splitting happens magically and instantaneously, with one half just suddenly disappearing and reappearing somewhere else. Although this leads to quite extreme effects it's actually the best-case scenario - any other way of splitting the planet would add energy to the system, making it even worse. I'm also assuming the split happens along the Grenwich Meridian, so that it splits England, Africa, both poles and the Pacific Ocean into two, while the Americas and East Asia end up in the middle of their own hemispheres. For someone in central America or Indonesia, the very first thing they'll notice is that gravity is suddenly half of its normal strength. This will probably feel like a terrible earthquake, as if the ground has suddenly started to drop away underneath them. This is just an illusion, though - it hasn't. Yet. For someone closer to the edge of the hemisphere, gravity has not only reduced but also changed direction slightly, since it now points towards the centre of gravity of the hemisphere instead of to what used to be the centre of the Earth. However, this is the least of their problems and they will not have much time to think about it, because of the enormous shockwave that's passing over the land at the speed of sound, destroying everything. This occurs because the air at the edge of the hemisphere is suddenly in contact with a vacuum and is rushing into it. The air that goes over the edge will then start falling towards the core of the Earth. Speaking of the core, this has now exploded. It was previously under a huge amount of pressure, so much so that the inner core is solid iron, despite being hotter than the outer core, which is liquid. Once that pressure is released it will turn back into a liquid, expanding as it does so. I'm not sure exactly what the volume change is, but I'm sure there are now unimaginable amounts of white hot liquid iron rushing out into space at 6000C. This explosion can't be seen from the surface, but it causes a shockwave of its own, which will travel up through the mantle and manifest as a huge earthquake, which will destroy everything the atmospheric shockwave doesn't get. For places far from the edge, the earthquake will arrive before the atmospheric shockwave, because it has less distance to travel through the Earth. After that, the half-Earth will start collapse under its own gravity to turn back into a sphere half the size of the original. The Earth's core is now entirely liquid and the mantle, while largely solid, doesn't have anywhere near enough strength to hold itself in a hemisphere shape without collapsing. I don't know how long this collapse will take but it will be well underway within hours if not before. If you watch simulations of the Moon-forming impact you'll see that the Earth behaves like a liquid when it is subject to forces on that scale. The process of collapse turns gravitational potential energy into heat, with the result that once it's finished the half-Earth will have a surface of molten rock and an atmosphere made mostly of hot gases that were previously trapped in the mantle and core. In short, most people will be dead within hours, and long-term survival is completely impossible.
