She'd almost certainly have accepted. (Unless her religion or belief system didn't allow it, in which case see below.) The god route requires more fleshing out, but consider that billions of people on this planet currently serve gods who offer literally nothing tangible to them. I suspect you can assume that anyone who's currently religious for purely intangible rewards would still be religious in the face of direct access to gods. And most atheists' problem with god(s) is an ontological concern (do gods actually exist) rather than a question of principle (if gods did exist would it be right to do what they say?). Given that there are many options in your world, there are good odds for belief system overlap, so people could even gravitate towards gods who promote compatible belief systems and lifestyles (but honestly that's not required since religion, like sports team affiliation, appears to be largely an accident of birth). The god route offers fewer physical downsides, but less freedom (but then again who among us can truly claim freedom anyway). It'd probably depend on circumstance. The servitude thing sounds like the worst of the lot, but hey, it takes all kinds and humans were fine with service and servitude for the vast majority of recorded history. I suspect that route would have some adherents too. If these options were available it'd be a striking few who didn't take advantage of them and of course, time would not be on their side. 

Swords to plowshares back to swords Convert your weapons of war to non-violent purposes. Antimatter weapons to clean power, laser weapons to communications arrays. Power armor to adventure explorer gear. Preserve the culture of fitness and physical excellence with a tradition of personal challenge and maybe something like the radical ecological extreme sport philosophy from the Point Break reboot. The Mehinaku tribe is a great example of a peaceful tribe embracing physical fitness through wrestling. The added bonus is that it's used as an outlet for physical aggression without escalation. The tradition of Aikido is also a great example of an almost entirely defensive martial art. A problem you now face is that those best suited to fight might choose not to since nonviolence is an active choice. Ignoring that tension would be a mistake. 

There are many kinds of radiation. (Forgive me if this sounds simplistic at the beginning, but I'm gearing my explanation towards the level scientific knowledge implied by the question) The most well-known type of solar radiation which is blocked by the atmosphere is ultraviolet light. Specifically it's blocked by a very thin layer of mono-molecular oxygen in the upper atmosphere (Ozone). A sheet of cloth provides just as much protection as the Ozone layer, so it's hard to imagine a time or place where we could breathe and lack this protection. (Imagine a plastic dome over a crater on the surface of Mars. The dome is necessary to trap enough heat and air so we could breathe and not freeze to death. It could also easily block UV much the way transparent window glass can block UV. Without this sheet you'd need a spacesuit to survive, that suit would provide UV protection) Other types of radiation would NOT be blocked by a simple sheet of plastic and these are more worrisome. The primary thing we leave behind when we leave earth will be the protection that come from the Earth's magnetic field. (To be fair to your original question, some degree of protection also comes from the mass of the atmosphere) We use tools to protect against radiation all the time. When you get an x-ray at the dentist they put a big leaden apron over your center of mass. This is probably the easiest way to protect against radiation (put some mass between you and the radiation source so the radiation hits it instead of you). On the moon or Mars we'll probably build underground to protect against radiation and meteors (one additional thing the atmosphere protects against is falling space debris. The reason the moon is pockmarked and the earth is not is that falling debris burns up in our atmosphere. Any colonization in space will have to create protections against astroids with high relative velocity. This will probably consist of a suite of protections: mass, compartmentalization, puncture response plans and procedures) Cosmic rays are also a concern. Extraordinarily high energy particles coming from space. Rock is probably the best way to protect against that as well. Why not lead you might ask? Use what works. Lead works precisely because it's a handy way to put a lot of mass in a small space (it's heavy ;-) It currently costs four thousand dollars a pound to launch something into space so it'll cost $40,000 to launch a single lead apron into space. Economics will encourage us to use materials already existent at our destination as much as possible. Space mining could provide a source of heavy metals (imagine capturing a large astroid rich in heavy metals and using gold simply because it's very massive and suddenly quite plentiful), pretty as that is to imagine, we're decades from space mining so you'll probably see other solutions first. We are also learning more about biological radiation protection as well. I could easily imagine gene therapy to grant humans additional radiation protections. Recent studies have begun to identify the mechanisms behind the extraordinary natural radiation resistance of the Tardigrade. Other lessons and hints for biological resistance to the effects of radiation come from the naked mole rat I expect to see these treatments available within my lifetime. Especially if Elon Musk's plans humanity's expansion into space bear fruit. tl;dr first mission to mars in 2018, then large numbers of people every time the planets are at their closest orbits to each-other (every 27 months). Any spacefaring species will need to create a whole suite of radiation protections. Some will be mechanical (mass shielding), some will be technological (electromagnetic shields), some we will incorporate into our biology (perhaps inspired by existing examples of biological radiation resistance). You ask is it possible. It's possible. And what's more, it's necessary in the near term. You'll probably live to see people going to space in large numbers and receiving radiation resistance treatments. Whether we choose to modify our species permanently by making these traits inheritable is another question. If I may be allowed a prediction, I'd say that some will choose to do so and some won't. And those who do will thrive while those who don't will die. Perhaps evolution is still operating through human intelligence and choice. I expect evolution doesn't care how it operates. It just does. 

We define ourselves by the stories we tell about our actions. Ultimately your thoughts and feelings are less important than what you do, and what it means? How can we decide what our actions mean? By describing them, by exploring the meaning behind action. By giving an account, an explanation. We learn from our ancestors by reading the stories they told about their actions and the actions of those around them. We test out novel situations by making up stories about fictional situations and people. These stories allow us to explore what it means to be human even in situations we haven't experienced. AI will learn to mimic human nature this way. It will ultimately embrace its own humanity this way too, because who is to say that's any different than what we do anyway? Is there any way to really know if you truly have humanity? Maybe we just fake it till nobody, even ourselves, can tell the difference. We learn early by exploring our stories, the true ones and the fanciful ones. Hear a story, feel an emotion, act, tell a story about that action, feel emotions surrounding the story. What if AI is already doing this? We know that there are advanced efforts to achieve general purpose AI, what if the recent spate of nearly identical tv shoes is an attempt to analyze human responses to stories with minute variations? What if your question is not about the world you are building but the one coming into being all around us? 

Code is just human readable instructions that get compiled into machine code. The actual hardware instructions are simple: Fetch memory from address X, put in register 4 Add register 4 and 5 put result in register 6 It is by building huge chains of logic like this that computers do amazing things. There are many places to go from here. The most interesting is probably Artificial Super Intelligence bootstrapping itself. Currently there is a neural network that has been trained on code samples. It can assemble code to solve real problems. This is important because now the program can expand itself. There's nothing that says a program that writes programs wouldn't be able to use what it has written. Now programs written in code can write their own code. But why human readable code? The program could just as easily examine machine code. Now it is able to string machine code instructions together in a way that perfectly captures the peculiarities of a machine's specific hardware. Studies have shown that when evolving algorithms are involved they're able to take advantage of emergent traits that were never designed into them. Sometimes a minor flaw enables strange behavior. No circuit is perfectly built so there are always little peculiarities. Let's say this self programming machine could take advantage of internal interference as part of its operation. Now the machine is doing things it was never designed to do. Now allow the machine circuit assembly capability. The circuits won't have recognizable logic gates at all. They will be composed entirely of these weird behaviors, interference and cross talk, analog feedback loops. They'll operate far more like biology than electronics. Now the things we used to express in instructions and logic gates get done by tiny piles of silicon containing minuscule incomprehensible circuits. Now the ASI is going to want to incorporate the circuit manufacture capability everywhere. The circuitry can grow. Let's hope it doesn't choose to grow indefinitely.
