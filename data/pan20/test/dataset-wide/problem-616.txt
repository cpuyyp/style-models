On the opposite side, I just have an axle sticking out. On this side, I have a freehub and an axle with a lock ring, and no clue how to get the lock ring loose so that I can pull the axle out. What am I missing? This should be relatively easy, but I've been banging my head against it for a couple of hours and making no headway at all. My bike shop was closed today and is closed tomorrow, so I'll call them on Thursday if I'm still having trouble. But, I wanted to ask here, first. 

I have a bike that I rather like, but it's geared entirely for high-speed road bike type work. It's fantastic on the flat areas of the route that I take every day, but I also have a couple of serious hills that I cannot climb with this one (I can climb them with a different bike). So, I'm looking at the possibility of saving money to replace the entire bike, or to regear it. An option that I saw today was something like the Shimano Alfine 11-speed hubs. I've not calculated gear ratios, but it's claimed that they have a very wide range and such a thing would benefit me. So, if I wanted to retrofit my bike to an internally geared hub, what is involved (and what are the terms I'm looking for)? 

I'm pretty vague on what industry terminology would be used in this case. I'm also trying to evaluate the viability of even doing this as I balance my options for adjusting or replacing the bike to better fit the city I live in. The only adjustment I haven't mentioned is for me to replace the front chainring (there's only one on this bike) with something a little smaller. I'd lose level-ground power but gain some climbing power. And that, really, might be the least expensive and easiest of all of my options. 

If all these things hold more or less true, and you're comfortable when you ride, don't stress what you look like. 

It will probably depend on terrain, speed, and other aerodynamic (or lack thereof) factors whether one would even notice a difference between an "aero" frame or a "normal" frame. If you're climbing lots of hills, riding in traffic, or otherwise not in a position where wind resistance is your chief enemy, I doubt you'd see a benefit from going aero. If you live out in the farmlands and ride on fast, flat roads, or somewhere that has lots of wind, you may notice a difference, because wind/air resistance becomes a factor. 

I find Clif Bars to be a pretty good solution. They're easy to open, they go down relatively easily, they don't melt or freeze (ever try eating a powerbar on a cold day?) and they have about 200+ calories. On rides shorter than 3 hours, I just take a couple of packets of Gu, one bottle of water, and one bottle of lightly-mixed gatorade (I mix from powder since the full-strength stuff leaves the mouth quite sticky on a ride). On longer outings, I'll take the Gu and a Clif Bar per 2 hours, and lots more water. 

If you look down at your front hub while riding, you want it to be somewhere in the vicinity of being hidden by your handlebar. For a commuter bike, you want to be able to look forward (with your head more or less erect) without feeling like you're craning your neck. In said upright-head position, you shouldn't have to stretch for your handlebar. Your seat should be at a height such that your leg is mostly extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, but you should not have to rock your hips at all during the bottom of the pedal stroke. Your seat should be situated fore/aft such that you can do the following: a. Tie a weight on the end of a string. b. Hold the non-weighted end of the string in the slight hollow on the outside front of your knee. c. The string should fall close to the spindle of your pedal when that pedal is at the front of the stroke (3 or 9 o'clock, depending on how you look at it) 

I have a long wheelbase recumbent built by Sun Bicycles. There are some complications with finding out what kinds of components went into the interior of the bike. Brakes and shifters have their brands labelled proudly, but the rest, not so much. And the manual that came with the bike doesn't mention anything about advanced maintenance. This is my first major bike maintenance project, going beyond my normal stuff of cleaning and oiling the chain or replacing the brake pads. The entire drivetrain has about 5000 miles on it and needs an overhaul. I can feel a lot of drag in both the front and rear axles. Not grinding drag, but just sluggishness in turning about the axle. So, I was taking them apart to figure out what components need replacing, and in both cases I ran into basically the same problem. The front looks like this: 

I've started to take off the lock ring here on the front hub. That entire conical shape actually appears to be the front lock ring. I can take it completely off, but once done, I have a lock ring on the opposite side, the axle sticking through the entire bike, and no indication that any part of it wants to come out. So, problem the first... how do I get the rest of the axle to slide out? The back looks like this: 

I'm looking to identify some very old rim brakes. I bought this bike used, and have now ridden it for enough miles that I strongly feel the need to replace at least the brake pads. No evidence that there is a problem, just a gut feeling that 5000 miles is plenty for one set of pads. So, I'm attaching pictures. I once did some research and think I discovered "Magura Move!" in some website archives from well before 2000. But, the Magura forums look pretty dead, and I would guess I'll get more eyes on the problem here. I'm looking to replace either the pads, or the entire system with a new one. I'm also considering the possibility of completely retiring the bike these are attached to. What I need to know is how likely I am to find new pads for brakes that may be twenty years old, and if not, what measurements will help me ensure that I'm getting a new set appropriate for my bike?
