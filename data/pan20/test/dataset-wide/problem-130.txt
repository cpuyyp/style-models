Since your remote crew essentially operate the ship as though they were there, we can model the effects of round-trip comm latency as an online game. We'll presume open space with noise not a factor, and hardware effects on latency negligible. Distances are the sum of distance between the command ship to the remote ship and the remote ship to the enemy (due to sensor latency) 1500km: 10ms Latency. Ace range, crews can operate ship as if in person. Human reflex limits are bottleneck. Probably favoured by your ace gunners etc. Weapons within 75secs of command ship. 2795km: Fighter kill range. Assuming a fighter the weight of a space shuttle (~75 metric tonnes) a fighter can accelerate to 105km/s and 200MT of energy within 26.5 seconds and covering this range. Your command ship should probably be able to swat a target moving at speed in a straight line from at least this far. 7500km: 50ms Latency. Optimal range, where most people can react. Past this point performance starts to decline. 15000km: 100ms Latency. Outer limits of FPS play. Maximum range for gunners, past this point fire control needs to be turned over to automatic systems. 18000km: Outer limits of standard weapons. Assuming 20km/s is a limit for relative velocity (ie. Aiming breaks down past here) past this point a ship can hyperspace quicker than weapons can reach it. 75000km: 500ms latency. Outer limits of third person (say, racing) play. Maximum range for pilots, past this point is autopilot land. 150000km: 1000ms latency. Outer limits of RTS play. Maximum range for tactical control, past this point it's likely only broad strategic control will be practical. This all, of course, goes out the window if c-fractal hyperspace missiles (kamikaze fighters) are in play. I'd suggest tuning the details of your hyperspace system to prevent such a strategy from being effective. (Maybe you crash into the shield from anything more than N seconds away, making point defence easy? Jumps are predictable? Your call) To answer the question, about 18000km from the battle would be the safe distance, but would be operationally impractical since a closer command ship would have better performance and outfight your fleet. Optimal engagement range would place the command ships somewhere between 7500-15000km from the 'front'. They would need to manoeuvre somewhat since they're still 'in range' but their attendant fleets would have a significant advantage against an opposing command ship staging a remote attack. Bomber command ships and other ships commanding vessels with simple fire control may be able to work out to a good 75000km though the bombers would be pretty vulnerable - though effective if the opposing fleet is tied up. 

Because it's not designed to, and it wasn't deemed a worthwhile cost to adapt the design to do so. Broadly, a spaceship's job (particularly one that flies in the air and in space) is to hold air inside the ship and resist, say, heating and atmospheric forces. Unlike a submarine, it doesn't have to cope with high external pressures or immersion. This lends itself to some design simplifications- external pressure requirements are much lower, and you can shroud water-susceptible components (against rain) rather than sealing them in. External access panels can be added for ease of maintenance. Heat ablation tiles probably come off easily for replacement. All these things will be selected without much regard to submersion, and as a consequence a dip in a lake (while unlikely to be completely fatal) is likely to cause no end of headaches for the crew. And don't even think about oceans - if they're anything like ours the salt water will do a real number on the ship from mere immersion, to say nothing of trying to dive like a submarine. 

The emotional warbot is a more agile, more creative, and overall more efficient warbot than a purely rational one. And that's because of what emotions are, when you get down to it. An emotion is a cognitive shortcut distilling large amounts of information into a simple feeling that can be rapidly processed and actioned. This has clear advantages- a warbot that has a bad feeling and avoids a rocket by suddenly hitting its thrusters is more effective than the one that takes a split second longer to analyse the situation rationally and decide to move (by which time it's thoroughly exploded). This also means that logical trains like 'this officer has a proven record of good decisions therefore I will weight their orders 25% higher than the other equally ranking officer...' get distilled to 'I like this guy.' That this occasionally leads to one of the warbots serenading its operator, promising to sweep him away onto its T345 Prometheum Flamethrower and carry him away to a special place just for the two of them, once the war is all over, is just a happy accident. 

Outside of workable common metals (which have value over scrap because they're already refined) there's also one precious metal in particular that meets both your rarity and post-apocalyptic value criteria: Platinum. Platinum is rare. Very rare. The world mining throughput of platinum is about 200 tonnes per annum. (Contrast, Gold sits around 2500 tonnes p.a.) It's also very durable: Scratching platinum only displaces the metal, rather than scraping it off. It's more durable than gold. Platinum recycling is big business, it's so valuable. It's also valuable. Very valuable. Besides consumer uses like the catalytic converters in cars, platinum is important for a wide variety of applications, such as electronics manufacture, fuel production, medicine, and the very highest temperature applications. Nevermind that not all of these applications would be possible 100 years after the collapse, if nothing else the University would understand how important it is to all kinds of old-world tech they're trying to hold on to and maintain. This makes platinum a bad currency. It's rare enough as it is, and in the post apocalypse, the University would probably try to have people killed to get hold of it. It's too valuable. But, there's a way out. Platinum isn't just incredibly valuable - it's incredibly difficult and expensive to refine. Or recycle, for that matter. Most of the actual platinum (from, say, salvaged cars or other platinum-containing scrap) won't be usable, or at least not contain enough to justify the post-apocalyptic cost of making them usable. In divided communities of less than a thousand the infrastructure necessary to do platinum recycling would be near-impossible; University might have a small scale operation but even that would only be able to handle so much at a time. Which leads to the currency - Platinum Scrap. Platinum-containing scrap is assessed (through a combination of tools and plain old knowhow) for how much platinum might be salvageable from it, and the density of it. More platinum-dense scrap is worth more than the same amount in a lower-grade collection of scrap, because it's closer to being usable (even if still impractical to actually recycle). Sufficiently high-grade (ie. platinum-dense) scrap would be especially valuable as currency, because high-tech groups like University will happily trade valuable knowledge and equipment for it. Lower grade scrap would be less valuable, but savvy dealers would have an interest in trying to process low grade scrap into higher grade scrap to improve their value. Or, for that matter, selling to people trying to get into the 'rebuilding technology' game for themselves. Surrounding this particular standard is the possibility of adding Rare-Earth elements keyed to the platinum-scrap standard, all of which have valuable high-tech applications but are useless to most factions due to the lack of viable infrastructure to effectively extract and utilise them. As with other precious metals, though, platinum-containing scrap isn't directly useful for survival. If it's being utilised at all in your setting it's likely only for research purposes and maintaining whatever technology survivors have been lucky enough to discover and hold on to for 100 years. Most of its value here comes from the demand from those few factions in a position to actually make use of it 

Mythologically speaking, there's precedents to draw on to establish a world. Zeus was notoriously fecund, birthing demigods left right and centre as various mortals caught his fancy. You might draw on that for some half-humans - in the times of yore the minotaurs were the offspring of a god in bull form and a human, hence they're essentially humans in spite of appearances. Perhaps an elf is really a half-tree human. Some shapeshifters can take the form of humans: selkies, legend has it, had a cap that allowed them to turn into seals. Some fishermen would steal their caps and hide them, so they could take them for brides. Thus, their children would be part selkie. Occasionally an unfortunate mortal would be transformed by magic. For example, one Chinese myth concerns a little boy who swallowed a magical pearl and became so thirsty he drank down a river, transforming into a dragon. In the greek tradition, Arachne was transformed after offending the gods. Perhaps, even after the magic, they are in a way human. Another myth goes in the opposite direction: A snake falls in love with a man, and uses magic to transform herself into a human to court him - aided by a fellow snake who transforms herself too and opposed by a jealous terrapin in the guise of a monk. Over generations, perhaps the truth of their animal heritage may slip through. Finally, there is the idea that some paleolithic depictions of animal-headed humans in truth depict shamans trying to gain the power of animals - it's certainly plausible in your world the non-human races are the product of success in this endeavour. Hopefully these concepts will give you some useful directions for how interspecies breeding might be justified from a mythical point of view 

Truth be told it's unlikely you'd see any effect at all. Most networking functionality is designed to work with as little information as possible and such a discrepancy would be well within tolerances for normal errors. Soon after traveling back in time your phone would check in with a time server and realise 'oops I'm a whole day ahead' and correct itself to the current time, and from there everything would pretty much work as normal. You might cause a bothersome race condition for the phone company trying to route calls to you for 24 hours but it's easily solved by getting another sim until your phone is unique again. If you're on the same physical network as your past phone the router probably won't route to your phone properly until you move away due to a mac address conflict. Unfortunately this isn't a terribly exciting answer - since all network protocols can be spoofed by someone with a computer and a network interface, everything pretty much doesn't blink when it comes to a couple of phones with the same info. 

Strictly speaking, you don't really need to do anything to adapt humans to 0g per se -the body adapts to it just fine. You might even live longer. The problem is mostly adapting to 0g without un-adapting to 1g. Once your muscles lean themselves down having gotten used to moving in 0g, landing on Earth may as well be landing on Jupiter. The smallest change would probably be amplifying the body's response to physical stress: to wit, exercise less, gain more. Then it would take less exercising to maintain strength and allow for training up for an Earthside trip (or, perhaps, for a long burn). Alternatively, slow down the rate of muscle atrophy for similar results. Beyond that, changes to the speed at which humans adapt to gravity changes would be valuable, to help cope with adaptation times and acceleration. You'd want to avoid too many changes, though. Humans are pretty well optimised for Earth and if you go monkeying about too much with us it'd be easy to make us unable to survive on Earth anyway. 

He who controls the spice, controls the universe. Or in this case, wormholes. Anybody who controls a wormhole controls exactly who is or isn't allowed to travel. Get on the bad side of Wormhole Corp? Well, better hope you don't need anything on the other side of their wormholes. If there are governments, they're likely going to control their own core wormholes and forcibly seize any critical arteries. So you're unlikely to see a core area controlled by a mega corporation that hasn't already supplanted the government. However, out on the fringes... whoever gets to own and operate the wormholes, be they an exploration firm or a terraforming conglomerate, essentially gets massive control over all the resources discovered on the other end. Even regulations can only go so far - paperwork can get lost for the wrong people easily, costing them valuable time to take advantage of the new space. Thus you're going to see wormhole gate owning companies in the ruling positions, and jockeying to take and develop a potentially valuable wormhole. 

This is a tricky one. Strategically we can exterminate the animals to remove the blood shaman as a threat, but that won't stop the existing powerful shamen. Since we're specified as having just the battalion and seeking a new life we're probably also not interested in going home and begging for the real army to come down. The good news is we can still fight this. We just need the right weapons and strategies to threaten the Blood Shaman. Close Quarters: Nets and Bludgeons The first thing we need is to be able to fight back against the Shaman at close quarters, when he tries to assassinate our people. The most important thing for this is armour. A cuirass or full plate is best of course, but at minimum we just need, say, a leather gorget and a piece of thick metal secured over our hearts. Easy enough to improvise, and it'll make killing us off a slower task - the Shaman can't just cut our throats or stab our hearts on the fly (or at least it's going to be harder). Next, we need to stay in groups. Sleep in well guarded communal halls. Post guards in and around our people, train guard dogs, and keep large patrols. This keeps the Shaman from picking us off one by one, and means we can easily back each other up in an attack. Finally, we need weapons. We need anything that can tangle up an assailant and whatever bludgeons we can scrounge (muskets are excellent bludgeons). He's bulletproof, sure, but the traditional counter to armour is a mace. It doesn't have to do much damage, just a little. If he commits to an attack we need to gang up on him, tangling and tripping him with anything we have and wrestling him as best we can (even a bison can't overpower dozens of strong humans) while bludgeoning him with our weapons. It won't do much individually but every little bruise will weaken the Shaman - and also keep him from switching to a more agile but less tough mode, lest he really get his head staved in. If we gain the upper hand we can finish him off with any number of awful fates, like drowning him, smothering him, dousing him in oil and burning him, or even just bludgeoning him to death slowly. This is only easier if he switches to a tougher but even less agile mode because he can be more easily overpowered. Skirmish Range: Swivel Cannon and Palisade At medium ranges, the Shaman is trying to use his mobility against us, likely using spears or flaming torches to kill us and burn us while staying too far to wear him down with shot. Here better armour helps but what we really want defensively is palisades. Makeshift walls we can hide behind and can get the spears stuck in them instead. Mounted on these walls we place swivel guns - small cannons normally put onto ship decks to be used against crew and boarders. If we have lots of spares, we can bind them together into volley guns to improve our chances of landing a hit. By shooting back with these in addition to our muskets, we level the playing field a bit more - even if a small cannon can't quite kill a Shaman, it can wound them and slow them down. Worse, if the Shaman tries to close in to kill the gunners, they risk getting netted. And then shot with a cannon. Long Range: Chain Barrage Finally we'll look at long range attacks. The Blood Shaman gets an atlatl or bow or stolen rifle and tries to snipe us with stealth. There's a traditional answer to snipers: Artillery. With a battery of large cannon we can force the Shaman to run by simply shelling the entire area he's attacking from. By loading the cannons with chain shot (two half cannonballs connected by a chain, normally used to cut masts) each shot can have a sizeable area of effect, giving us a better chance to cripple the shaman and reducing how many cannons we need. It's going to be tricky to actually hit him since he's so fast, but we can still make sniping risky. If the Shaman makes a habit of sniping we can start setting up traps - simple ones, like a trou de loup or a punji trap. With a barrage of chain shot coming at the Shaman, a moment of hesitation or a slight stumble can be fatal.
