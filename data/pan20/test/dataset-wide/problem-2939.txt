Regarding the truth of physicalism WRT the existence of Pzombies, in order to reach the conclusion that "physicalism is false" from the premises given, then it must be part of the definition of "physicalism" that all mental states are identical with and reducible to physical states. It's this necessary property implicit in the definition of the term that would make physicalism false (if you buy such arguments) because the Pzombie counts as a conceivably possible counterexample to the universal claims of the physicalist. However, if one offered a more nuanced definition for physicalism, something like "To have mental state X is to be in physical state Y" such that "physical state Y" is functionally defined, then non-physicalist arguments for and from Pzombies become significantly more difficult to maintain. One philosopher who argues for at least the possible existence of Pzombies is (famously) Chalmers. 

Since "I am hungry, so I am going to have dinner" can be formalised as P -> Q, I suppose that "I am hungry" can be formalised as P. For instance: 

People cannot sell themselves, as seen above, but they can certainly sell their time. Otherwise wage labour would be as impossible as slavery. As such is not yet the case, there must be a fundamental distinction between ownership over one's body, and ownership over one's labour time. Of course, there is no contradiction between being a slave and being a prostitute. But there is no contradiction between being an agricultural labourer and being a slave. Heck, there is no contradiction between being a philosopher and being a slave; Epictetus was both. But slavery is a formal relation, not a material one. Epictetus was a slave because he was captured, enslaved, and sold, not because he was a philosopher. The same is true of a prostitute; she is a slave if she belongs to another person; otherwise she is something else. 

I'm not an expert, so I can't say if any professional philosophers have argued for or against this view, but granting every person even tangentially involved equal value seems to result in a tautology. Real-world interactions, such as the manufacture and sale of a ring, involve enormously complex social dynamics. If we place equal blame on the person who mined the stone from the earth and the person who tried to steal the ring that the stone was set in, should we then place equal blame on the person who designed the ring? Or who made the tools that the designer used to fashion the ring? Or the parents of the designer, who encouraged their child to pursue work in jewelry-making? Or the person who invented rings in the first place? What about the salespeople, the distributors, the advertisers who made the ring seem appealing, or the friend who recommended that particular jeweler? And this is just the chain involved in the creation and sale of the ring--we haven't even begun to dig into all the factors that might influence the decision to wear the ring, the decision to walk in the park, the thief's decision to carry and use a gun, the gun's manufacture and sale, the park's designers and builders, and on and on. We could keep listing potential influences literally forever! In a chaotic (read: very complex) system such as this, if you don't allow for differing degrees of importance it rapidly becomes impossible to draw any sort of absolute lines at all. 

If to reincarnate I must forget everything I know, in what sence it can be said that "I" am reincarnating? What is left of "me" if all my memories, ideas, feelings, etc., are gone? 

This is quite evidently false. There are 11 swimmers, and only 8 skiers (if this is a word). So, at least three swimmers cannot ski (or may be they can, but don't actually practice the sport; in any case, we are not told about what people can do, just about what they do in a regular basis). 

More generally, we should start by determining what we mean by "democracy". In my view, there are two very different meanings for this word, which are often confused, and even strawmaned against each other. First, "democracy" is a method for decision taking. The method is simple, though its application may be problematic. The steps are, 

The type/token distinction appears to be generally explained in terms of objects. A given Honda Accord is, e.g., a token of of the type "Honda Accord". However, the literature I have read seems to do little to explain how such a distinction could/should be applied to events. Can anyone direct me to resources that discuss how to apply the type/token distinction to events? 

The razor hasn't been appropriately deployed here. Where you say "simpler one" you really mean that the razor would have you pick between hypotheses A and B in virtue of the number of explanatory posits they individually put forth. Specifically, if there are more explanatory posits in A than in B, and A and B both satisfactorily explain all of the relevant observations, then B is simpler than A. 

This highlights another frustration some academic philosophers might have regarding Ayn Rand. She relies on absolute self-certainty where she should be relying on well-reasoned arguments. One problem here is doing this often resembles well-thought-out, consistent philosophy, but in terms of actual philosophy, it amounts to nothing more than polemics and screeds. From her writings, all that can be logically deduced are her opinions, yet I have no doubt that Rand dislikes Marxism, nor do I doubt her love of Capitalism. Another problem is that assuming the certainty of your conclusions is simply poorly-executed philosophy â€“ every philosopher must be willing to accept that they could be wrong about their conclusions, or else they are not doing philosophy. Again, her work is thus philosophically uninteresting. But if your thoughts are provoked by her writing, that's a good thing. I recommend taking some time to sketch out her arguments and see for yourself if her conclusions actually follow from her premises. 

As described in this excellent essay, every ethical situation has three elements: an agent making a decision, the actions taken (or not) by that agent, and the outcome of those actions (or inactions). Thus, there are actually three different possible perspectives on ethics: 

Mathematics as a concept may not be value-laden (it's debatable whether concepts or objects of any sort can or cannot have intrinsic value), but mathematics in practice certainly is. Ask any professional mathematician which of two proofs or axiomatic frameworks is more beautiful and the question will make perfect sense to them. Since beauty implies a value judgement, mathematicians must have values in regards to axioms and proofs. But axioms and proofs are all that mathematics is! Put simply: if art is value-laden, so is mathematics. 

Let's look at an example you may be familiar with: say there's a train car with a dozen passengers headed off a cliff. You can redirect the car to a safe rail, but there's a person tied to the tracks. The question is, should you switch the car to the other tracks, or let it be? An outcome-focused agent would decide what to do based on the consequences of their decision (how many lives will be saved?) A rights-focused agent would decide what to do based on a set of personal moral guidelines ("thou shalt not kill," the Golden Rule). A virtue-focused agent would base their decision on the kind of person they hold as an ideal (what would Jesus do?) Note that which perspective you take can influence your decision, depending on the circumstances, but doesn't necessarily determine it. It should also be apparent that these three approaches are complimentary, not competing: since you can't have an ethical problem without an agent, actions, and consequences, all three perspectives play a role. Certain perspectives can be more useful in some situations than in others, but in general which perspective you choose to base your decisions on is largely a matter of preference. 

This is the case because Rand offered very few philosophical arguments. I actually do not know of any particular arguments she did offer, but I will assume that she at least attempted to offer some. 

Here you've given some great examples of when to use Ockham's Razor because you've invoked explanatory posits that unduly complicate a reasonable analysis of the applicability of Ockham's Razor. Questioning Ockham's Razor means questioning the role of theoretical simplicity and the number of proffered explanatory posits. The only problems you bring up with the razor are borne of "credence distributions." What exactly are credence distributions? No matter what your answer is, they will also be explanatory posits of your theory. By definition, more explanatory posits makes your theory more complicated. In principle there's no reason you can't bring new explanatory posits into a theory, but as the Ockham's Razor wikipedia article says, they must offer some explanatory power. Including "credence distributions" in your theory doesn't seem to explain any more than a theory without them, and in fact seems to create problems where there were none. 

You've presented a false dichotomy: just because something is a "mental construct" doesn't mean that it can't also be a real property of the physical universe. Take length as an example. "Length," as such, doesn't exist physically. It's not something you can see or touch. Nevertheless, it is a real quality of physical objects--it exists "out there" and not just in our heads. In this respect, length is like any other measure--it's an abstraction in the sense that it does not exist in and of itself, but it nevertheless describes real qualities of physical objects. Time is no different. The more you understand of physics, the less sense it makes to think of time "extending" in any direction. Time isn't a medium, it's a measure, and what it measures is change. As for what change itself is, well...that's still an unanswered question! 

In the analytic tradition, philosophical arguments consist of clearly stated premises and logically sound conclusions. Some (already noted) attempts to locate in Rand's work such specific premises and conclusions show that her positions on several important points (e.g. causation and free will) are self-contradictory and inconsistent. This makes her conclusions irrelevant to the philosophical discourse in which she appears to have been attempting to participate. So in this way, the answer to your above question is a resounding "YES!"; a lack of argumentation entails a lack of rigor in argumentation. Upon reflection, I realize that one could respond here by saying that Rand was engaged in a more Continental approach to philosophy. Consider her tendency to employ fiction to "make her point" â€“ a strategy (as previously mentioned in another answer) employed by Sartre and Camus, among other Continentals. Reading her this way, Rand's work could be seen as having a place within some larger historical philosophical discourse. However, her well-documented ideological struggle against Marxism undermines her own argument again here; the Marxist dialectic underpins the Continental approach to philosophy. If we are to take Rand's conclusions seriously, which is to say that if we take her particular anti-Marxism to be the point she is making, then she is using the Marxist dialectic to completely disavow Marxism, thus ending the dialectic. There are two problems with this. First, her work would be little more than her bid to be the "the champion of all philosophical discourse", and second, there are still WAY too many questions left unanswered for us to stop doing philosophy. So frankly, she has written nothing particularly philosophically interesting or compelling. 

From my experience, people who believe in "animal rights" vary a lot on what animals they think deserve rights. Generally, they include pets and cute wildlife mammals and birds; some do include cattle and farm animals in general (pigs, horses, goats, etc.) Insects and invertebrates in general are usually excluded, as well as fish, amphybians, and reptiles. Disagreeable mammals and birds - rats, vultures - are usually excluded to. Internal parasites are always excluded. In short, I don't know any such people who doesn't discriminate among animals. Generally speaking, such discrimination divides animals that are more human-like from those who are less so, useful (to humans) animals from those that are noxious (again, to humans), and idealised wildlife animals from non-domestic animals that people actually know. 

Fallacies are logical flaws in reasoning. If there is no reasoning, there is no fallacy (there may be other things, even worse than fallacies). In your Alice x Bob example, there is a reasoning by Bob: 

I'm going to try not to step on any toes here. No matter how you slice it, the content of your belief is almost undoubtedly not the "resulting distribution" of a "credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." It's easy to see why it can't be: when someone asks you if you believe A or B, your answer will never be "the resulting distribution of a credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." That may describe how you came to hold the belief you hold, but that process is not the content of that belief. 

Ockham's Razor is a maxim. Maxims are succinct principles or rules that are used to guide actions. The razor guides us to prefer the theory (or theories) that posit(s) the least total number of entities while satisfactorily explaining the phenomena in question over theories that explain the same phenomenon but posit more entities. As the razor's Wikipedia article says:
