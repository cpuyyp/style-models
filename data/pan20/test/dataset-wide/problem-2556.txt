So I just read "Waking the Buddha" by Strand and he had a comment: "It is unlikely that those who attended them would have felt within their rights, to demand that the Jodo Shinshu teachings showed practical application in daily life. In fact, the prohibition against intercessionary prayer in Rennyo's tradition would have argued against it." In Jodo Shinshu, can one efficaciously pray to the Amida Buddha for some result in this world? 

Yes. Since the question is reasoning from the point of a belief in the realms, I'll answer it as one. In the realm of animals, it is difficult to earn good karma since it is assumed that animals life brutish lives of killing and savagery. In Tibetan Buddhism, contemplating how lucky we are to be human where it is possible to practice Buddhism is a fundamental practice. In a typical contemplation, the unfortunate lot of the animals is a common theme. As a side note from someone who sees the realms as myth and not necessarily the most valuable ones, I would speculate that if we were, say rather smart cats, and the Buddha were a cat, then we still could choose to eat fewer animals, be more humane in their raising and slaughter, or slowly switch from animals to plants. My own cat eats an omnivore diet, a product of how pet food is sold in the US. He eat enough corn gluten that when I'm eating corn, he wants to eat it. Cats are poorly adapted to a vegan diet, but do fine on an omnivore diet. In biology, omnivores, carnivores and herbivores often evolve into a different category, although they ordinarily only make one jump at a time, from carnivore to omnivore, then to herbivore. 

As @Tenzin said relationships are not illusion. They are like illusion. They are ,as @ruben2020 ,said conditioned and impermanent. But they play a role in your evolution towards Anatta. Like wholesome and unwholesome qualities , relationship can be good or bad. When a relationship is good then it is like a medicine. For example you can have good relationship with Sangha or community or people with integrity. The purpose of medicine is to cure the disease of self and then the medicine is left. Many wholesome qualities like compassion , loving kindness etc also act like medicine. But when the relationship is bad you can leave it right away unless offcourse you want to improve it out of compassion. Realisation of Anatta is like Nirvana which is attained by developing various wholesome qualities and developing good relationships. Good relationships are vitally important. 

State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) and the Buddhist Association of China are in charge of regulating religion in China. So far, what effect have they had on doctrine for Chinese (non-vajrayana) Buddhism? It's already well known that the Chinese government is hostile to the Dalai Lama. (Also, as a side note, for those skeptical of any government's ability to regulate belief and practice- some percent of American Zen's doctrine and practice can be traced to Meiji era government initiated reforms) 

This question is pretty straight forward. Suppose I wish to attain Nibbana then what are the conditions which I must fulfill in order to attain Nibbana? 

In above quote it is clear that Buddha says another Buddha will rise. Is it not the rebirth of Buddha ? (I am not saying rebirth of Gautama but Buddha) My question is if Nirvana means cessation of birth then how is it possible for Buddha to take rebirth? 

Namo Buddhaya. This sutta asks for development of 7 factors of enlightenment including Mindfulness and Equanimity. Development of Mindfulness is described in detail but I couldn't find any sutta describing development of Equanimity. My question is : Can you please suggest a sutta which describes how to develop Equanimity ? 

Ká¹£itigarbha is an Bodhisattva (portrayed as an ordinary looking monk) who rescues people in the hells. Depending on the flavor of Mahayana Buddhism, this is either meant literally, or it is a story about what behavior that a Bodhisattva practicioner should emulate. (Scholar Jan Nattier in "A Few Good Men", where she notes, "After paying homage to the Tathagata at the entrance to the vihara, the bodhisattva is told to remind himself that "I, too, should become one who is worthy of this kind of worship""-- i.e. capital-B Bodhisattva's like Ksitigarbha are to be copied, not so much adored & petitioned for help. (This isn't true for all of subsequent Mahayana!) 

Namo Buddhaya. Sabbe Dhamma Anatta. Form is Anatta too. Meaning form is not worth identifying as myself, me or mine. Does that mean that I should identify myself as formless ? Am I in form or am I formless or I do not exist ? Similarly for feelings and consciousness. Should I identify myself feelingless? Should I identify myself consciousless( i.e. I will become without consciousness) ? I am pretty confused. 

In Mudita meditation or Joy Meditation I am supposed to experience Joy for all beings. But I don't know which aspect of living beings is worth celebrating. My question is : How should I express Mudita or Joy for all beings? EDIT: To support my mental dilemma I quote Maiterya. 

I think I might have found the actual source. In an anthology of Japanese Literature, I find almost the exact same text, in what looks like a modern fictionalized discussion between two monks, one who says the quote is from Vasubandhu's "The Treatise on Consciousness-Only" I haven't confirmed that, because I can't find the full text of it. 

The Buddha and the Dharma are not very controversial, although there is some disagreement among the sects about how awesome the Buddha was (was he god-like or just a really great guy) SGI has dispensed with the ordained, monastic sangha. This probably was a result of history-- the split between the SGI organization and the Nichiren Shu sangha, probably not so much because SGI didn't like the sangha. For a secular Buddhist, there isn't anything special about ordaining-- it's another institution to be judged on its own merits and results. As for joining, it depends on if you see any particular benefit to that particular institution. As for supporting the sangha, it depends on if you see any particular benefit in supporting it. As far as institutional Buddhism goes, I think Japan got the closes to laicizing the sangha with the Meiji reformations. Once, or if you dispense with the institutionalized monastic order, then the sangha is just the "congregation", the community of other Buddhists. Finding refuge in just the community of Buddhist though seems a little insular. I'd rather feel responsible for all humanity and expect all humanity to be responsible for me in return. (As an ideal, in practice it's dog eat dog and few people give a hoot) 

I have evolved a little since asking this question. I will try to answer the question. First and foremost let us understand that not everything that has been written can be understood fully with proof as we generally stop at the theory. We never fully live the path as preached by Buddha. Only a Buddha can understand some part of the theory because he has experienced it directly. Having said that it is clear that the question can be answered. Who was ignorant about the Truth in the beginning? Answer is that we can not ask this question. This question is wrong. The question assumes existence of Self before the origination of Ignorance. The fact is ignorance led to the emergence of Self. The right question should be : Ignorance is a condition for what ? Answer would be Ignorance is a condition to origination of merit and demerit. Merit and Demerit are condition to what ? Merit and Demerit are condition to Consciousness. Consciousness is a condition to what ? Consciousness is a condition to body and mind ... and so on... I must admit we do not know answers to some questions like : 

Source wikipedia So if this is a 1st precept violation-- it depends. Motivation seems to play a role. Suicide as a way out of a terminal and painful disease is okay, not taking care of yourself and dying is not okay, suicide as a means of helping others is okay. 

Depends on which system your in. In the Mahayana system, the precepts have an animal liberation theme, i.e. not using animals for anything. In the Upasaka precepts. 

Buddhist morality, as a rule of thumb, has to do with how such actions affect your ability to practice (i.e. can you still meditate), and does it cause suffering in yourself or others, as opposed to morality being based in compliance with the demands of a supernatural being. So, on those grounds, this amount of alcohol is not problematic. It won't make you behave in a way that makes you break the rest of the precepts. As for how institutional Buddhism handled alcohol, it varied, I'll link because they say it better than I can summarize. As for how much Kombucha you'd need to drink to get smashed and risk breaking the rest of the precepts...you'll start puking and farting before you get drunk on Kombuch, this guy tried it. 

If there is no Self , then what Self is there to be affected by the karma which the non-Self now performs? EDIT: A similar question I guess was asked in Samyutta Nikaya and Buddha replied as follows : " With thy thoughts, which are under the dominion of desire, dost thou dream thou canst overhaul the teaching of the Master " However I not sure what that means. I would be really happy if someone can explain the meaning of that answer from Buddha.
