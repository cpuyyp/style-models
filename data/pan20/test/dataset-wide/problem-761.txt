We can't detect whether there are or are not objects of similar "small" sizes orbiting other stars. We simply lack that level of ability. From a scientific point of view I'd simply say "don't know". From a practical point of view I would expect other stars to have systems with a huge variety of things in orbit - there's no reason not to expect this, but it's bad science to assume it. 

That's a hard one to call. This would depend on how far apart they Sun and the BH were and how massive the BH was. But we'd have lots to worry about. 

And a simple average of these gets you an average distance of about 5.2 AU. The problems with that simple estimate are : 

The idea of wormholes is completely abstract. We have no evidence they actually exist and they are a result of following the strict mathematics of general relativity to and beyond it's intended limits. When you push a theory past it's "design limits" you can't expect the results to be valid. Sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't. 

Keeping it as simple as possible. The more energy there is, the harder it is for the (relatively) weak electromagnetic force to bind electrons to nuclei ( and an atom is a nucleus with electrons bound to it ). When there was more energy the electrons and nuclei had too much energy to be bound together. A simplified way of looking at this is that the electrons and nuclei were simply moving to fast when they were hot ( temperature is related to average energy which is related to motion ). 

When astronomers discuss the "habitable zone" around a star they're really concerned with someone likely to provide liquid water and the right amount of radiation for basic life (cells) as we understand them. But this doesn't mean they're suitable for humans. Maximum mass is not an issue, it's gravity that matters. We need a few things from gravity to be human habitable. Firstly we're "designed" (evolved) to operate in a one-gee environment. As far as I know there have been no studies on long term high gee effects on humans (low gee, yes, but not high gee). However, considering the "plumbing" and structure involved in a human, it seems unlikely to me we'd adapt long term to more than a small percentage larger than one-gee. Much more on a sustained basis would seem likely to increase physical stress on the bones, muscles, tendons and so on and lead to more rapid development of related illnesses and disabilities. The plumbing (fluids are being moved all over your body) can cope with quite high gees for short periods, but it's simply not designed to cope with sustained high gee. The strain on the circulatory system strikes me as the greatest vulnerability. Movement in high gee is also an issue. I'd be surprised if people could adapt to long term requirements without serious health side effects. We'd also be more vulnerable to injury from falls and slips. Consider how long you could walk in 1.5g. It would be the equivalent of walking while carrying something weighing half as much as you do yourself. If you were 100 kilos, how long could you walk while carrying 50 kilos ? If you had to do that all day, everyday, how long before the strain caused serious injuries and other health problems ? Not long, I think. So just on this basis I'd suggest a maximum sustained gee of about 1.1 is ballpark. Walking around with ten kilos when you are 100 kilos sounds like a lot all day everyday, but it's probably doable. But gravity does more than provide a way to nail us to the ground. It provides a way to nail the atmosphere to ground at an atmospheric pressure high enough for us to use, and not too high for us. Now it would appear from human habitations in the deep sea, that we can sustain quite high atmospheric pressures, so that would not seem likely to be a problem. What tends to hurt humans is shifting quickly from high to low pressures. As I've argued that we can't sustain high gees for long and need something close to one gee for health reasons, the atmosphere doesn't seem to be a problem in that case. So what does 1.1g mean in terms of planet size and density. The gravitational pull is proportional to planet average density and radius. So we need a planet that's around the 1.1g mark meaning : $$1.1 \rho_{earth} r_{earth} \approx \rho_{new-earth} r_{new-earth}$$ where $\rho$ is density and $r$ is radius and this represents the limit. So this may make it easier to find suitable planets. We aren't restricted to specific mass ranges, but can look for planets that are less dense and larger or more dense and smaller. But this does make me wonder if the notion of human colonization of planets ever made any sense. Building our own large habitats in space is starting to make a lot more sense to me as it restricts us less. 

For the sake of teaching some scientific reasoning skills, I'll point out that just because you think it looks like a star does not mean it is a star. In fact the motion of the object suggests it was not a star. Stars do not move except as part of a general motion of the night sky dues to Earth's rotation. What you describe is not that. When we try and work out what something is, we use all the evidence. What would it be like ? Perhaps a helicopter with lights. 

Because a year happens to be the period of time that matches the changes in seasons and heavens we first noticed and first gave that name. We've just refined the definition a bit more. After some thought I've edited my original to include a reference to the Egyptian Calendar which has three seasons ( winter, summer and inundation ), so four seasons doesn't have to be the number. It is notable that the approximate year length seems to be the same. I dare say other similar examples are out there and unknown to me. 

You seem to be implying that anti-matter has negative mass. All particles (including anti-matter) have either zero mass (like photons) or positive mass (like electrons). So regardless of whether the anti-particle or particle escapes, the black hole looses mass (more precisely it looses energy). 

No such assumption or bias exists. As far as we know the universe treats anti-particles just like particles with different properties (e.g. charge is opposite compared to the corresponding particle). 

No mention of us heading into the center of the galaxy. It's estimated we "orbit" the galaxy about once every 240 million years note that even if we were falling in it would take an minimum of that kind of time scale to reach the center of the galaxy, something I've heard no evidence for. It's only 16 galactic orbits until the Milky Way - Andromeda merger is under way, and that's probably not enough for the solar system to "fall" into our galaxy's center even if we thought it might. So most likely scenario is that we end up in the merged galaxy long before we end up reaching our solar system. 

The singularity is a property of the space-time distortion inside a black hole, i.e. a result of the gravitational field of the black hole. The gravitational field has effects on space-time both inside and outside the event horizon. The event horizon is what defines the black hole's extent. 

That is evidence. :-) One of the problems with what you're asking for is that it presumes that neutrinos don't oscillate. If someone gets an experimental result apparently demonstrating they do, you should not ignore it. I don't know how familiar you are with the theory of neutrino oscillation and why it's so important, but I've linked to Wikipedia's page on the subject as a starting point just in case. 

This is not correct. It is considered a dwarf planet because of a technical definition employed by the IAU in deciding what is a planet and is not. This technical definition relates to an object's ability to "sweep" it's orbit clear of asteroids and other small debris. The decision has nothing to do with Charon. The centre of rotation is calculated using Newtonian physics. I think what you want is the Center Of Mass and related topics. 

Because these are unstable configurations. Even if they could form from natural processes (which is unlikely as I'll explain) the resulting forces and stresses (for large objects) would be too great to prevent collapse into a more stable shape. Now smaller objects can form less rounded shapes - small asteroids can be all sorts of shapes. Only their relatively small mass (and hence small gravity) allows them to resist compression into "nicer" round shapes. But larger objects have lots of gravity simply because the have lots of mass. The materials they are made of will not withstand compressive forces on them and they will form roughly round shapes, because that's the most resistive configuration. So why more-or-less spherical ? Because these larger objects tend to form in a way that builds up material equally all over the surface, so there is some tendency to be spherically symmetrical just from the way material accretes as it grows. However once they get really big (planets, larger moons and so on) the forces on the materials will be so great that they will as a general rule, behave a little like fluids. And fluids will end up in that nice spherical shape as they lack the rigidity to resist compression. Again a little simplistic, but this gets really complicated quite quickly. They key here is to stop thinking of e.g. rocky planets as rigid objects. Maybe on a timescale of seconds they are, but on astronomical timescales they're not so rigid. So for larger objects, more-or-less spherical is inevitable simply because they're large. 

You need to define an agreed standard for orientation of axis and origin. What co-ordinate system you choose as a standard depends on your purpose. Here are some examples and links : Celestial coordinate systems. Typical reference points are defined using very distant objects whose position can be measured accurately ( typically quasars ). 

A jet is a generic term to describe the ejection of material. You'll see it used all over the place in physics (and astronomy). Jet's can be any form of matter ( solid, liquid, gas, plasma ). A geyser is a specific type of geological process and, as I understand it, means (at the least) a liquid is being vented (typically water). The exact process is, of course, not known for certain for non-terrestrial bodies. I don't think using the term "geyser" is a statement of certainty, but would be used to indicate the general type of event. I think you're more likely to use "jets" if it's not properly understood and "geysers" when you're either proposing a mechanism that's geyser-like or it's generally accepted that they're geyser-like already. But I don't think that's written in stone. 

What you need to understand is that a black hole is a region of space defined by an event horizon. The key point about an event horizon is that if you're inside the region it surrounds you cannot get out. But it's only the stuff inside that is restricted in this absolute way. If something is outside (even just outside) it can, in principle, happily orbit the black hole. And in fact we know that this is possible because the super massive black hole at the center of the milky way is known (and was identified because of) stars that orbit it (and approach very closely). Radiation emitted by material near a black hole can, therefore, reach us.
