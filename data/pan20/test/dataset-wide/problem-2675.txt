Edit: While looking at the answers a thought came into my mind - most of the answers say something like "you can't not do both, it'd be way less effective". If so, why there are so many physicists that don't study philosophy? Why, for example, are there no philosophy courses in the physics degree? Are they being ignorant of philosophy? Do they think physics is inherently enough? Or do they simply don't interact with philosophy to even know its necessity? 

In a classic theory of knowledge, there are typically 3 conditions that must be fulfilled in order for something to be considered "known": 

First and foremost, is there a branch of metaphysics that focuses on the "opposite" of ontology, or more precisely, the "things" that don't exist in our ontological world? (but rather maybe "exist" [though it can't be stated to be "exist" when the term is used inside the ontological branch itself] in other worlds) 

I don't want to start going through agnosticism, as it isn't as relevant to this question, so I'll set this one aside. 

We don't really know. However since we can observe that there is something, rather than nothing, we can guess that it must have been harder for nothing to exist rather than something. It's a guess and it need not be perfect, but I am afraid this might be as close we get to the answer of this question. There is something rather than nothing, because it was easier for something to be. 

Everything in thought is a comparison. So, when you say "lying to yourself". There are two possibilities. 1) There is an objective truth of the matter. You tell yourself anything but the objective truth. In that case yes, you would be lying to yourself. Within this possibility again, you might or might not be aware of the objective truth. If you are aware of the objective truth, then there is no way you can lie to yourself and not know that you are lying. If you are not aware of the objective truth, and tell yourself otherwise, then you are lying to yourself without knowing that you are lying to yourself. (Like the example of the woman you gave above). 2) There is no objective truth of the matter. In this scenario, it is really hard to deduce if you are indeed lying to yourself. In fact, it might be impossible to do so. If the only truth is subjective, then from your point of view, the best subject is you, yourself. So whatever you tell yourself will happen to be true. 

Awkwardly synthesizing jobermark's old question Is there a boundary on 'physical'? with my (badly put) question Can physics talk about non-physical entities/concepts, and if not which academic department does?, finally pinpointing (I hope) what bugs me. Let me start with what I'm hoping to find: 

*by "progression of philosophy" I mean like for example how Kuhn identifies progression of science as paradigms, or the classic linear view of progression. 

I must say this is a topic that's been bothering me for some time now, especially considering my confusion of current state of academic departments. Put simply, I understand while reading philosophy of nature (the older term, I think, of nowadays physics) that the study of nature of the world (i.e. cosmology, parts of metaphysics, etc) used to lie in the philosophy department. But nowadays it seems as though philosophy stopped studying such subjects (or at least most of it, as subjects such as philosophy of mind still exists), and now the department that studies them is mostly physics. Correct me if I'm wrong, but by that development, the conclusion to a student interested in (what used to be) "philosophy of nature", is that he should study physics, and not philosophy (perhaps some combination, but physics would be the dominant one). Is that conclusion the correct one? Note that this is purely practical question. [I had no idea which tag would fit, so edit if you have any suggestion.] 

$URL$ Both these arguments look sound to me. You only have to argue that "nothingness", can exist. From there it's a short step to saying that it always exists. In the second case particularly, linking nothingness to the empty set, say that the empty set exists, then it is always a member of all sets that exist, due to it's simplicity. Of course, one would never be able to detect nothing, since one can only detect physical objects which exists, so actually proving the argument is impossible. 

I understand the value of falsifiable beliefs. Often they make predictions, and are classified as scientific ideas, useful in churning out predictions. But do unfalsifiable beliefs have any value? Philosophically or mathematically or otherwise? I know value is a little vague, but consider for example the concept of eternal return. If true it would have a large impact. But, then it's unfalsifiable. Can't be verified at all. So a sentence A, if true would have a large impact, but it's unfalsifiable at the same moment, would you assume any importance to such sentences? 

[Note: If there was a tag for that, I'd tag this question as philosophy-of-history-of-philosophy (as convoluted as this term is, I think it fits the question the most).] This might be a bit too historicisty, but bear with me. First I'd like to ask for a particular view: was there any philosopher who presented the progression of philosophy* as such that over the course of it, we see many philosophical questions being taken in many different interpretations, in all sorts of contexts, and the questions (generally speaking), remain pretty much the same - only that in different contexts there are different answers. So, we can infer that the way philosophy works over the course of history is by answering the same questions, but in the way that fit to the culture at the time. This way we have a sort of predefined number of questions (the only things that can have new "progress"/ideas are sub-questions and interpretations). Note: this "predefined number" isn't a metaphysical statement on its own, but rather a sociological or epistemological one- those questions are simply what interest us as the human kind (similar in a way to the idea of "noosphere"). 

The result of Godel's theorems was that we knew for sure that a formal axiomatic system wasn't capable to derive all of mathematics. The math derived under the system cannot be consistent and complete. Why isn't the onus of failure put on mathematics as well? Seems to me like if mathematics cannot be derived under any formal axiomatic system, then the problem is with mathematics as well, because you'd certainly need a formal axiomatic system to derive any complete sentence. How do we even know then for sure that mathematics is complete and consistent?(If these words still apply) 

Let's define logic as: A statement and it's opposite, obtained by applying the "not" operator, both cannot be true. The not operator is applied to the part of the sentence describing action or attribute. Example: a) The apple is red. The apple is not red. b) Swamy crossed over the fence. Swamy did not cross over the fence. If in a set of statements, there exist two statements which are both true, and are opposites, then the set is inconsistent. Do all paradoxes fall under the set of inconsistent statements or set of statements? (Assuming of course that I have reasonably and objectively defined "logic", and other terms). 

Two of the biggest German Idealism movement, Schelling and Hegel, have a very similar line of thought. I was wondering a simple question (with probably a long and complex question) - what is the difference between Schelling's System of Transcendental Idealism and Hegel's Philosophy of Spirit(/Mind)? (in both systematic and theoretic perspectives) 

Are there any 20/21th century philosophers that talk about a different approach to the study of nature other than science? Are there any that criticize science? 

(I know some will reject the idea of having a "line" between science and philosophy, but I don't want these answers, let's assume there is.) We often draw a line between science and philosophy that separates between the two fields. This line is always changing, we can see it over the course of history. My question is rather simple (or maybe not?) - where is the line between natural sciences and philosophy nowadays? Is it changing even today? If so, what's the direction it's going? I'm sorry, I know there's some clarifications needed here, I hope you can help me clarify in the comments. 

But, in (2), (B) is true under doubt or statement (A), and since (B), is in doubt, it is not as True as (1). Again, the order of statements matter quite a lot. Consider the sentence, 

This(C) is false, since we have already established in (A) that we are doubting, so it’s complement in a sense, that “I doubt, that I am doubting”, has to be True. Or, am I wrong somewhere in logic? ( I get my obvious current mistake, but trying to reword it meaningfully) 

One could argue that "nothing", which would be the absence of all things, would be permanent in this world. 

I know that the naturals are assumed by the axiom of infinity, but the relationship between them (eg 1+0=1), must be rule based or defined at the very least. Basically I want to know what makes 0 or 1 abstract. For me to figure that out, I must also have their precise definitions? I know that 0 is an abstract concept, but I want to know what or what not in its definition makes it so. Is abstraction another name for commonality? 

*ethics- meaning ethics in every relation, be that ethics of some scientific subject, or ethics of humanities in general. **majority- please note that by majority I definitely don't mean most important! 

A. I have met the criticism that metaphysical theories doesn't/shouldn't care about (natural) science (=physics mostly, if not only), as in it doesn't really have a direct relation to it (such criticism was noted on several of my questions, and is pretty rational and probably true). But I must admit, I'm rather confused. I'll start with a quote from Chalmers' article "Idealism and the Mind-body Problem": 

Now let's digest our subjects. I'd like to state that both theism and atheism, by definition, are not dogmatic, only that under certain circumstances (highly subjective) they can both arrive at dogmatism. Looking at our definitions (which considers a personal subject, rather than a group of people, so I'm not considering "theism"/"atheism" as an organized group but rather as the personal faith) we can see that a theist person, while believing in a divine force (and sometimes in its commands) isn't necessarily "dogmatic", meaning he wouldn't necessarily object any sort of evidence against his view - he might accept it, he might contemplate with it, and yes, he might also completely reject it. On a personal note I'd like to add that I've seen all of these cases in Judaism. Now, what might be difficult to address it the reason why atheism can be dogmatic as well, but I'm sure that if you've carefully read my terms it shouldn't be a problem. See, atheism, very much like theism, can be mostly considered a faith just as much as theism - it's simply a negative faith. I'd argue that anyone that claims he's an atheist but would not accept to see his view as faith, but rather as "lack" (more precisely, passiveness) of belief, is agnostic. The atheist (although he obviously wouldn't agree to look at it that way, because he's against faith and all of its implications, which is absurd on a different level that doesn't belong to this question) would actually believe that God doesn't exist, and hence will have all implications of possible dogma as much as the theist.
