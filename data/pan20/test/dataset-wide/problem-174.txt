Unless the word implausible in the description of the Death Note means what it means when I use the word, the US has no chance at all. As the Death Note and Name Vision are described, the dictator of Lalalistan has infinite wishes, limited only by requirement that he must envision a specific person for each wish, who then dies. So the dictator simply envisions a random public figure from America, and writes "X sends out a mental blast which kills every other American, and then dies from the stress." If the term implausible is meant to exclude that, then the specific meaning of implausible in this context needs to be expressly spelled out. 

The biggest difference (as a person who is familiar with only the basics of the early history of the USSR) is that the purges would probably not have been as bad. The officer corps purge almost certainly made life easier for the Wehrmacht, and so the Soviets' share of the butcher's bill would have been smaller without it. 

Another factor that should be taken into consideration is the amount of investment required in order to successfully rear the child to adulthood. If the amount of effort is intense and lasts for more than a decade, the pattern of something like the arrangements we see in humanity will emerge. If the investment is brief or light, then the mother will do the bulk of the work. 

Resources. If humans and the aliens both need (or greatly desire) a resource subject to the rules of scarcity, the potential for conflict is present. Pride. If our rulers decide that their interests are best advanced by conflict, there will be conflict, unless the rest of humanity responds to this by replacing their leadership. 

I'll agree with Raisus and say, "Nothing positive." The top 1% of wealthiest people works out to 70+ million people at the moment, and while they may not be the top 1% most productive people on the planet (I'm sure that quite a few got their wealth via inheritance and/or government favors), they are certainly concentrated at the top end of the productivity scale. More importantly, they are concentrated in the management levels of the economy (whether in or out of government), and so the economy of the richest nations will suffer a catastrophic setback. You are also going to lose every autocrat on Earth and most of the their hangers-on; they have all used their power to put themselves well into the 1%. You will also lose the top tier of our entertainment industry (the top musical acts, top movie stars, and top sports stars). So in the freer nations the management of the economy is suddenly cratered (not good), in the non-free nations the top level of government has just be taken out (which sounds good, but), leading to acute instability (which is not good), and a whole lot of wanna-bes in the entertainment industry will finally get their chance at stardom (which may or may not be good). 

As others have pointed out, any society capable of routine interstellar traffic will, on their way to Earth, pass by many natural resources which their technology will enable them to exploit with more ease than much of what we treasure here on Earth. So they will come to Earth to get other things. It will likely turn out that if they elect to conquer Earth, they will do so for the sake of imposing a particular societal form upon us (whether religious or secular), regarding this not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself; in other words, the whole point of the military conquest is to force seven billion people to live their lives according to the conquerors' wishes. It may also be that while space-based habitation is practical for brief residence, there are long-term health effects (perhaps peculiar to specific races) of residency in space, which are avoided by dwelling on planetary surfaces. We have a large surface area which is protected from the harshest of interplanetary and interstellar radiation by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field, and has a naturally self-regulating atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen, etc, in a somewhat varied range of temperatures and humidities. If they like our surface conditions here, we may find regions of our planet being scouted out as development property. Offer them Detroit. 

The answer depends on what you mean by "word". In addition to all of the different channels for transmitting information that can be layered simultaneously (for which Zxyrra's answer will give you the scope of possibilities), there is also how long these different channels can go on before you call for the end of a word. Having learned a bit of German, I've indulged in the amusement of stringing together as many thoughts as possible into one word (which German allows). There is also the issue of eliminating ambiguity. There cannot be too many instances where words with different meanings can be mistaken for each other (and this is worse, and not better, when the wrong word makes sense in the context of the correct word), or people are going to start changing the language to minimize these instances. Finally, you can't have too many rules in your grammar. Languages have to be used by people, and people want to get stuff done. When observing the finer points of the grammar gets in the way of taking care of the business of life, people will start to ignore the finer points. 

If you're going to take a bit of artistic license with the laws of nature, you could postulate a hyper-efficient photosynthetic material which combines CO2 and H2O into formaldehyde and oxygen gas, using as its energy source infrared radiation (ie., heat). The heat is absorbed and the CO2 is reduced. Be sure to collect the formaldehyde and use it as a feed stock for your organic chemicals industry. 

More seriously than in my comment: People who want to get away There will be movements, of varying sizes, consisting of people who are disaffected by whatever society they are part of here on Earth, and would be trying to gather the resources and technology to start a new community on whichever planet they prefer. Think of space ships named 'Mayflower', but instead of Puritans, each group would consist of libertarians, communists, persecuted minority sects of Islam, black nationalists, white supremacists, people who think Star Trek is a documentary, etc. Worried Governments The governments of Earth, frantically afraid that this might lead to an independent nation that is militarily more powerful than they are, or lead to a rival nation having a leg up on the rest, would do everything in their power to ensure that colonization either does not take place or takes place on their terms. The United Nations The U.N. will claim all authority over any extra-terrestrial human activities. Soft-headed people in western democracies will take this idea seriously. Dictatorships will pretend to take this idea seriously while brow-beating western democracies, but will ignore the idea entirely in practice. "Hands Off The Other Planets" Movements These people will claim that raping the environment of one planet is surely enough, and oppose any exploration or colonization of the pristine wildernesses of either planet. Venus/Mars Deniers The natural allies of the people who claim that the moon landing was a hoax, these people will claim that the reports of life sustainability on the other planets are all lies. The explanation for why the government is going to the trouble of crafting this lie will vary, but at least on group will claim that it's a plot to liquidate undesirables under the ruse of sending them to colonize the other planets. Ship the ____ to Venus/Mars As a "humane" alternative to a second Holocaust, there will be voices calling for the shipment of minority groups to whichever other planet is least hospitable. Finally, we can get rid of the Christians/atheists/Muslims/Kaffirs/gays/homophobes/communists/capitalists/Trump supporters/Hillary supporters/etc. Colonialism was Awesome, Let's do it Again! We get even more complexity if Mars and Venus are inhabited by intelligent life. In addition to every well-connected person wanting to go over there and exploit them for their own benefit, every ideologue of every stripe will want to go there and teach the natives about Jesus/Muhammed/Marx/capitalism/the healing power of lesbianism/etc. Oh, and alien porn, too. Don't forget that. (Although it probably will be something best forgotten...)
