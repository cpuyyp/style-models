From Scientific American - Fact or Fiction?: Urinating on a Jellyfish Sting is an Effective Treatment: 

From ABC News - Old Wives' Tale? Urine as Jellyfish Sting Remedy: , said Dr. Paul Auerbach, an emergency physician at Stanford University Hospital and an expert on jellyfish stings. The best thing to use is acetic acid, or regular household white vinegar, Auerbach said. ... the beaches of Australia are lined with vinegar stands, says Dr. Suzanne Shepherd, a travel medicine specialist and emergency physician at the University of Pennsylvania. Shepherd also recommends avoiding fresh water to treat a jellyfish sting because it could just cause the remaining nematocysts to fire. 

Of course, just because a waiting period is not required doesn't necessarily mean that one can't be imposed. But I haven't yet found a state that does so. Examples: From the Washington State Attorney General's Office:

Not a single atom that is in your body today was there when that event took place … Matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you. Whatever you are, therefore, you are not the stuff of which you are made. If that doesn’t make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, read it again until it does, because it is important." [Richard Dawkins uses this quote in his TED Talk (around 10:20)] 

So at least, we know that legalization does not spread the use of abortion as a contraceptive method if alternatives exist. 

There has been some changes since the OP asked this question and at least one relevant research paper has tried to provide a new answer to this question. According to study this (Mäntylä T. 2013) published in one of the top ten peer reviewed journal of psychology: Yes there is evidence... but men seems better at it (emphasis is from me) 

Mäntylä T., Gender Differences in Multitasking Reflect Spatial Ability, Psychological Science, April 1, 2013 24: 514-520 

Limitations The author is aware of some limit of his experiments. Most of them are related to the assumption that multitasking involve spatial abilities. I extracted the most interesting part of the discussion, but refer to the original paper for better understanding of their impacts. (again, emphasis is from me)

From the various researches found, we can draw the conclusion that Yes, it does decrease abortion rate in the place where it is banned 

In conclusion, from the statistics, there does not seem to be any link between the popuplation number and density and the homosexuality rate. Therefore, it does seem to contradict the claim that homosexuality exist to control the population growth. 

My answer would be no, but it is not clearly proved nor provable (I don't see how it could ever be proven). I wanted to take a different angle than the other answers and I hope it will help the readers to draw their own conclusions. If there is a correlation between population control and homosexuality, there should also be a correlation between the homosxuality rate through the ages. Sadly, we were not there to poll the population in ancient times even though it is known that homosexuality was present and accepted in ancient Greece [1] for instance. However, we do have surveys from the early 50's when the world population was only 2.5 billions compared to today 7 billions. So, looking to the research papers, can we see a correlation? 

But there might be caveats with this study, since core temperature possibly varies due to things like age, level of fitness and menstrual status [1, 2, 3, 4] This study did a "Comparison of thermoregulatory responses between men and women immersed in cold water":

on Saturday Night Live ? [1], [2], [3], [4]. My question: Does (or did) David Hasselhoff have more fans in Germany than in other countries? 

Yes, it does, approximately 3 times that amount by weight, but that's not the whole story. You should consider other factors too in determining whether this means it is more harmful: Firstly, when people smoke cannabis leaves or buds, they smoke them in a rolled cigarette which is usually larger than a tobacco cigarette. This would suggest that not only does cannabis smoke contain more tar, but that cannabis users inhale more smoke. In the outset, this seems worse. Consider also, however, that cannabis smoking is often a social activity, and that people may not actually smoke much of a joint to themselves in the main. It may also be the case that cannabis smokers may not smoke as often as cigarette smokers. Both of these facts may suggest that cannabis users don't typically inhale as much tar overall, as actual amount of smoke inhaled could well be 1/3rd or less of the smoke inhalation of a regular smoker. Equally, a portion of cannabis smokers will also smoke tobacco. In considering the content of tar, you may also consider that low-tar cigarettes haven't be shown to actually reduce risk of cancer, and hasn't been shown to reduce emphysema either. The basic conclusion of this is that yes, we know that cannabis smoke contains more tar, but we don't know that that makes it more harmful, nor do we know whether cannabis users actually inhale more tar, even though cannabis contains more. The answer to your question is yes, but whether or not the difference in tar content impacts health is undetermined. 

No, not in the sense that you mean. It isn't only Mythbusters that have debunked this one. Even if your feet only make contact for a brief moment, the weight of a human, plus the weight distribution of a person makes balancing on a dynamic very difficult. Further explanation here in Popular Mechanics. Walking on water is a popular magic trick, but it's nothing more than a cleverly established illusion. Walking, or something akin to walking, on water is possible if it is combined with something like cornflour (Cornstarch for the Americans) to create a non-newtonian fluid, but this is not not exactly water, and not exactly running!
