This is a result of Rayleigh scattering, the same reason the sky is blue. As the sun sets the optical path for a photon passing through the atmosphere to your eye increases. Because of this increased distance through the atmosphere, more scattering occurs and the shorter wavelengths are scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths. This results in light that is reaching your eye tending toward red and the yellow to orange and gold hues are produced on the way to red. The reason you can still see this persist after sunset is because the sun below the horizon can still reach you through scattering though clouds can enhance this effect (because clouds are good at scattering all visible wavelengths and clouds you can see can be illuminated by a sun you cannot see). This is the same principle as above, with the addition of the scattering by the cloud. You'll have Rayleigh scattering on the way to the cloud through the atmosphere, uniform scattering off the cloud and then more Rayleigh scattering between the cloud and your eye. The longer these distances become, the more red the light reaching your eye has become, and thus the sky will take on the reddening hue (with the yellow/orange/gold colors in the transition to red). 

The amount of surface heating from the sun is a function of time of year and latitude. You are aware of the dependence on the time of year with the sun over the equator at the equinoxes and ~ $\pm$23$^\circ$ N at the solstices. The varying position of the sun overhead means the projection of a solid angle from the sun onto the surface of the earth will vary as well. This just means that when the sun is low, the energy in a "beam" of sunlight is spread over a very large area and warming will be reduced. This is why a bright sunny day in the winter cannot provide the same heating as the bright sunny day in the summer. Surface energy loss is a function of the temperature of the surface, and atmospheric energy loss is a function of the local atmospheric temperature. There are some complications here, namely clouds and greenhouse gases that prevent some radiative losses. At the summer solstice when days are long and the sun is at its highest it is easy to understand that we are getting more energy than we are losing, and the days should be warm. What isn't so apparent is that after the days start shortening and the sun lowering in the sky that the days continue to warm. This is simply because we are still getting more energy than we are losing. It isn't until the energy losses (which happen 24 hours a day, regardless of day/night) finally overcome our energy gains (which only happen when the sun is out) that the days will start to cool. 

This scenario has a capping inversion between 900 and 850 mb but is otherwise the same as the previous example (same surface temperature and dewpoint). The pollutants have the same properties as the first scenario. In this case, however, due to the temperature inversion there is a height where the environment becomes warmer than the pollutants. If the pollutant ties to rise any higher it will be negatively buoyant and will oscillate around the height of neutral buoyancy (see Brunt–Väisälä frequency). In this case the pollution will be trapped around 860 mb, which is around 1250 m. This isn't too close to the ground but in a well mixed boundary layer this pollution eventually will be mixed throughout the boundary layer. This pollution is trapped. Both of these scenarios are on warm well-mixed days. Bigger problems tend to happen at night or early morning and in the cold season. In these cases deep inversions that start at the surface tend to form and if smokestacks are not very tall this can cause pollution to be trapped very close to the ground. This kind of temperature structure will cause the pollutant to spread out at low heights. In places where these type of inversions are frequent it is important that smokestacks are built tall enough to emit pollution above the inversion height. The picture below demonstrates how this kind of pollution trapping can look. 

The kind of tornadoes "tornado alley" refers to are associated with supercell thunderstorms. To first figure out why this region exists, we need to explore why this is a hotspot for supercells. Thunderstorms require energy and this energy comes in the form of convective available potential energy (CAPE). This is simply the vertically integrated buoyancy of a parcel from its level of free convection (LFC) to its equilibrium level (EL). Thunderstorms need CAPE but CAPE is not a great predictor of what kind of storm we get, that falls to vertical windshear. Supercells form in environments with a 0-6 km shear (this measure if just a vector difference of the winds at these levels) greater than 20 m/s. CAPE is going to be maximized where you have warm, moist air at the surface and cold air aloft. The Gulf of Mexico has plenty of water and it is common to find strong southerlies advecting this moisture into the US. With a particularly strong low level jet, this moisture can be advected as far north as the Dakotas. As warm air is typically found toward the equator, this is also advecting warm air northward. This results in a tongue of warm, moist air extending northward out of the gulf. The cool air aloft is provided by the Rockies and high plains. In the boundary layer, mixing drives the temperature lapse rate toward dry adiabatic, while in the free troposphere the lapse rate is typically less than dry adiabatic. The high elevations of the mountains mean that there are boundary layers and some layer of atmosphere with a dry adiabatic temperature profile. These cool, dry adiabatic layers get advected by the westerlies aloft and end up on top of the warm moist air provided by southerlies out of the gulf. This setup provides CAPE and the necessary shear (southerlies at low levels and westerlies aloft) for supercell thunderstorms. However, not all supercells form tornadoes, and why is an area of active research. Tornadoes will be favored with low LCL heights (lifting condensation level) and large low-level shear. The occurrence of these environments combined with empirical data result in the area termed "tornado alley". The US isn't the only home to such a place. There is a similar setup in Bangladesh where warm moist southerlies come off the ocean and cool adiabatic layers come from the high terrain in the region. 

The characteristic funnel of a tornado is caused by condensed water. A tornado is a swirling mass of air with very high vertical vorticity and a corresponding drop in pressure. Large tornados can have pressure deficits on the order of 100 hPa, which is significant compared to synoptic horizontal pressure gradients. The drop in pressure causes air to expand and cool and if the air is humid enough this will be accompanied by condensation and the visible appearance of the funnel. It is also worth mentioning that the visible tornado funnel does not have be in contact with the surface to be a tornado, it is only required that the surface wind circulation is connected. In these cases the lowest part of the tornado may remain invisible. As a tornado persists the funnel cloud can pick up debris (dust, dirt, plants, parts of destroyed structures, etc) and some of this debris can orbit the tornado (other parts may end up lofted into the upper troposphere or centrifuged out at low levels) adding to its visual presentation. 

Clouds require moisture and therefore high clouds will exist in regions with upper-level moisture. Synoptic scale ascent is on the order of cm/s and this is not an efficient way to bring moisture from the surface to the upper levels. Consider this water vapor imagery: 

Using your example of 10 AM EST and 9 AM CST, those are both exactly the same time and another way of specifying that time is 1500 UTC or 15Z (Z being historical for GMT, for your application the difference between UTC and GMT is negligible). If you know the location of your stations then you can know their timezone. To make inter-comparisons between stations meaningful you need to reference them all at the same time and the easiest way is to express them in UTC. You are correct that this is just a nomenclature change but this gives all locations a common reference anywhere on earth. All meteorological data natively uses UTC and has been since telegraph was invented and weather data was exchanged over large distances. 

In the mid-latitudes we experience 4 seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) due to the large annual variation in sunlight due to the tilt of the earth in its orbit. The tropical latitudes, however, do not see large annual variations in sunlight or temperature and instead define their seasons by precipitation changes e.g. wet and dry seasons. Some examples of a wet/dry climate are monsoon climates and savanna climates. The monsoon is driven by seasonal changes in wind directions. The typical setup is offshore flow during the dry season and onshore flow in the wet season with a mechanism similar to the sea breeze (e.g. driven by temperature differences between land and sea). During the dry season, dry air flows out to sea and during the wet season, moist air flows inland from the sea, rises and produces rain. The monsoon circulation occurs in parts of Africa, Asia, Northern Australia and arguably in the North America desert southwest (debatable because it lacks a true seasonal flow reversal). The savanna climate generally have a dry season of varying intensity and length and a rainy season in the remainder of the year. Total rainfall in savannas tends to be less than that in monsoon regions. Both of these wet/dry climates involve interaction with the inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), which is a persistent band of rising air and thunderstorms near the equator. It moves north and south with changes in location of the sun seasonally and responds to the monsoon circulations and ends up merging with them. The other tropical climates are wet all year long (rainforest climates) and dry all year long (desert climates). The rain forests are equatorial and dominated by the ITCZ year round. The hot deserts are around 15-30 N/S latitude and are favored on the western extents of the continents. The latitude preference derives from the descending branch of the Hadley cell, which suppresses precipitation and causes warming. The western continental preference comes from the direction of the trade winds, which are easterlies in the tropics. 

You see the same effect in daytime maximum and minimum temperatures where (barring anything but solar influence) the daily max is often in the late afternoon and the daily min is often just before sunrise. This is the same reasoning as above, just on a daily scale rather than seasonal. The sun is overhead at solar noon (this varies with local noon based on longitude, time zone (daylight saving time)) but continues to provide solar heating after solar noon. It isn't until the radiative losses overcome the radiative gains (afternoon to late afternoon) that the temperature will drop. Likewise when the sun goes down temperatures will cool down until the sum comes back up. 

So far we've mentioned that the wavenumber of the planetary wave has an influence on movement of the pattern, but what about how the pattern evolves? There are a lot of factors here: 

If you look closely at the diagram you'll notice height isn't the primary cause for the convergence between the adiabats, though it is the driver. Note that toward the upper right there is still appreciable difference between the adiabats and as you move to the left the height they converge at decreases. The reason for this, as your intuition suggests, is that condensation ceases. The reason, simply, is that there is no more water left in the parcel to condense and release latent heat. Recall the lines of constant water vapor mixing ratio (the lines you use to connect surface dewpoint to the LCL). These lines decrease to toward the left and are sloped steeper than the isotherms. As moist parcels ascend the latent heat release is correlated to decreasing water vapor. At some point we exhaust the water vapor and any further ascent cools at the dry adiabatic lapse rate as there is no more condensation. This is what causes the moist and dry adiabats to become parallel at upper levels (higher for warmer / moist surface conditions and lower for cooler / drier source parcels). In the comments, concern was expressed that the skew-t isn't capturing the relevant physics, including how a parcel runs out of water vapor. The skew-t does indeed capture this information and one way you can observe this is by calculating equivalent potential temperature, $\theta_e$. This temperature is the temperature of a parcel with all of the water vapor condensed out of it. The more moisture in a parcel, the higher the equivalent temperature will be over its actual temperature. To calculate it on a Skew-T you raise a parcel high enough for the moist and dry adiabats to be parallel, then descend the parcel. On the way up once saturation is reached you'll ascend via moist adiabat and once the water vapor is exhausted you descend via a dry adiabat. You can try this for various source parcels and convince yourself that the Skew-T captures these physics. You should note that the more moist a surface parcel is, the higher it must ascend and the warmer the equivalent temperature will be. 

For soil mosture you can initialize the model with a dataset that provides that information. If you are doing historical retrospective you are likely going to initialize from a reanalysis dataset and if you are doing a forecasting case then you are likely initializing from GFS, RAP, HRRR or some other model. For the case of initialization from GFS, the grib files you can get from NCEP have soil temperature and moisture for 4 levels 0-0.1 m, 0.1-0.4 m, 0.4-1 m and 1-2m below ground. The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data a single layer for subsurface soil moisture and temperature available every 3 hours and from daily or monthly means. The ECMWF reanalysis (ERA-interim) has 4 layers of soil temperature and mositure and a surface roughness.
