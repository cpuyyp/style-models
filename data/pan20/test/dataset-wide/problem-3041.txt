Specifically, I'm interested in the last documented occurrence of swords (of any sort) being used as a primary weapon by infantrymen or cavalrymen in Western warfare. That is, when did any European or North American army last combat with swords in live battle? I think I am safe to say that by the late 19th century swords were overwhelmingly ceremonial items, harking back to the earlier days of warfare. No doubt, even in the 17th century when gunpowder and indeed muskets were being increasingly starting to be used in battle, the sword would have played a diminished role compared to that of the High Middle Ages (12th century). However, I am tempted to think the sword lingered on in usage for centuries afterwards. Does anyone have any historical evidence to suggest when this usage finally stopped for good? 

Monotheism This does depend on the definition being used for monotheism, which there appears to be some confusion about. Originally monotheism implied there was only one God, and all religions were searching for that God (possibly erring in their perception of God). In this sense, Judaism is not monotheistic, as it says there is one God, but other religions are NOT searching for God, but are worshiping false gods. Judaism In the sense of the belief of there only being one God, however, the oldest recorded monotheistic religion would be Judaism and its precursors. The religion describes only one God, the mention of other deities being restricted purely to idols and to poetic script. Atenism Some have tried to say Atenism is the oldest religion, from 1350 BC to 1320 BC. The religion, however, did acknowledge other gods, but some have excused that detail for political reasons, the king being urged to admit other gods. Judaism never acknowledged any other gods, but is sometimes excused of this on the grounds the Jewish people often practiced multiple religions. No doubt there were worshipers of Aten who also believed in other gods, so I believe this point to be inadmissible. Dating Judaism and Moses You can take several possible dates for the beginning of the religion. Judaism itself is taken from Judah (יהודה), and the modern form of the religion (containing all the books of the Tanakh) would've began around 516 BC. The date of Moses formalizing the religion is commonly stated as 1250–1200 BC. The biblical record dates it as 1450 BC, which agrees with several archaeologists' findings. Several theories would push this date back to 1650 BC, contemporary with the Bronze Age Collapse of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and the sacking of Canaan. (Source: Patterns of Evidence: Exodus) Ancient Precursors Regardless of how you date Moses, Abraham predates Atenism by centuries. There is no evidence to suggest Abraham believed there were many gods, the only accounts we have of him suggesting he believed in one God. The genealogy of the bible is a good example of this, where he and others recorded a lineage back to the first man, Adam, who himself was a monotheist as described in the religion. The fact these beliefs are contemporary back to the time of Abraham is confirmed by similar folk history, legend and religion across the world. Many people talk of a first man, of a great flood that wiped out the Earth, of eight people who survived on a boat and repopulated the world, from Polynesia to China. This would make Judaism and its precursors the most likely candidate for the first monotheistic religion. 

During the era when the Phoenicians ruled the Mediterranean sea and surrounding territories (cerca 1550 - 300 B.C.), salt was indeed a highly precious commodity. After this, the Romans became the dominant force in the Mediterranean, though the value of salt did not immediately decline by any means. Whether it was pound-for-pound as valuable as gold, I think it is hard to say, but probably not out of the question at some point. Until relatively modern times, salt was prized mainly for its ability to preserve foodstuffs as well as season food. In the hot Mediterranean climate where fish and meat would decay rather quickly, this was particularly useful. The period of Phonetician domination during the early to mid first millennium B.C. (including its successor state Carthage) represented one of the world's first monopolies. Essentially, other nations (including Ancient Greece and early Rome) did not have great access to salt, and hence the Phoenecian monopoly could dictate its own outrageous rates. From this article on the economy of the Phoenicians: 

I was looking up the income disparity today. What I got for America, was Food service could get as little as $18,000 annual income, while Lawyers got paid $140,000, surgeons $320,000, and Bill Gates made something between 2,600,000,000 and $11,500,000,000 annually. So Bill Gates earns over 600,000 times the income of the poorest job I could find. My question was how much of an income gap there was in medieval Europe, to compare? Were the Kings and merchant guild leaders earning 600,000 times what the day labourer was earning, in the middle ages? If you need the time narrowed down further, I was thinking from the years 1200 to 1400. 

The origin and spreading out of the Celtic peoples is a topic shrouded in mystery, at least to my mind. While the Germanic migrations occurred during the late Imperial Roman period and Early Middle Ages, the Celtic migrations generally occurred much earlier, as there is historical evidence of the Gaels existing in Ireland since at least 500 B.C. The Brythonic Celts, as opposed to the Gaelic (or Goedelic) Celts, have a somewhat better-known history, at least in the sense that we know well that they inhabited the lands of Ancient Britannia (specifically England, Wales, and southern Scotland) and later Brittany in modern France (following the Anglo-Saxon invasions of England). Geographically, this is a fairly localised region, and well documented thanks to Roman sources. A few facts we do know about the ancient Gaelic peoples: 

In the Colonial Period, Europe had some ideas about the enlightenment that made slaves unpleasant to their sympathies. For that reason, despite the English having slaves in their colonies, you could become a free man by visiting Britain's shores (there were some interesting court cases related to this). More important to this era was poverty, which was a big issue in European cities. So there was no shortage of cheap labour; even with the dying out of serfdom. Serfdom lost popularity in Western Europe around the 1300s (though cases remained until the 1500s). The practice was continued in Eastern Europe for a lot longer, to try and fill the gap in the agricultural market that arose with the reduction of serfs. After the Napoleonic wars, serfdom mostly came to an end in Europe, save Russia. The place where a demand for cheap and harsh labour was in force, was in the colonies with their plantations. Recruiting people from the European homeland to farm this would've been difficult to convince them and expensive to pay them, so slaves were the economical way out. 

Pre-dating the usage of spies by the Persians is (perhaps unsurprisingly) the Ancient Egyptian use of spies and military intelligence, from at least the New Kingdom period (late 2nd milleniunm B.C.) onwards, but quite possibly even from the Old Kingdom. period (early 3rd millenium B.C.), as suggested by the reference to "early Pharaohs" in the following source. This source describes the ancient usage of spies by the Egyptians, and lists evidence as hieroglyphs discovered in Egypt. 

I'll answer just the part about the Roman Republic, if that's alight for now. The Roman Republic is probably best described as a pseudo-democracy of sorts. Its creation and initial set-up actually pre-dated Athenian democracy by a single year, though even until its dying days it was more of a "democracy for the privileged" than anything. Hence, Classical-period Athens is usually considered the world's first true democracy. Nonetheless, the Roman Republic was clearly a very successful model for a state. It was ultimately the lack of fail-safes and precautions against powerful consuls and leaders that led to its down-fall, and arguably the fact that only landowners had a say in the vote, or indeed only equestrians (members of the ancient noble families) could become senators or consuls. Your average peasant, born in Rome or otherwise had little say in the state. Generally seen as the first real sign of the downfall of the Roman Republic was Lucius Cornelius Sulla's stint as dictator (to use the actual Latin word). Dictator was a special privilege granted to a military leader (general) by the Senate -- often a past consul by nature of the office -- in times of great need. For example, during the Sack of Rome in the 4th century B.C. by the Cisalpine Gauls (of northern Italy). It was however used extremely sparingly until Sulla was granted the position during the Roman Civil War of ~82 B.C. (the very worrying second one in the span of a decade). The senate relied on the honour of the general to relinquish the title of dictator when it was no longer required and return to normal life (of a senator often). Fortunately at first, Sulla did this, though as we all Gaius Julius Caesar did not and craved power until his final assassination. Ironically, Caesar was known as a member of the populares (unlike his aristocracy-aligned rival Pompey [Gnaeus Pompeius] of the First Triumvirate), gaining widespread support from the working class, and thus facilitating the end of what small democracy there was, and the start of Octavian's tyrrany. I hope you can see from this that effecitvely the collapse of this pseudo-democracy was facilitated greatly by the lack of sufficient legal codes as well as increased internal strife within Italy, propagated by corrupted and varying degrees of oligarchic control. There were always too many loopholes in Roman politics and law to allow power-hungry men to wield disproportionate control. One might say the Roman Republic was a time bomb ready to explode (though not as disastrously as the Roman Empire of course!). A lecture summary for a history course on Classical History in the Purdue University gives a good summary and highlights four main causes (in the lecturer's view, though largely accepted by historians I'd say): 

Early grenades weighed about three pounds, apparently, and were generally thrown by tall, strong men. I haven't been able to find a figure on how far they were normally thrown, at what range they were considered effective. Does anyone know how far grenades could be thrown by hand, in the 17th (and early 18th) century? 

That implies something like 1 in 6 to 1 in 4 troops were casualties, if we assume the vast majority of casualties were from combat. Thinking of Justcal's statistics from before, it was about 58,000 casualties, 48,000 from battle. So, if we assume non-combat casualties were involved with the first statistic (questionable assumption) then about 1 in 12 are combat casualties. Then 1 in 7.2 to 1 in 5.2, for combat troops, using those estimates. Calculating the Daily Odds Now, if we assume this is at all accurate, we only need to do a little math to get the daily chance of being wounded or killed. I'll only go through the higher estimate, 1 in 5.2, for now, . The Vietnam war lasted about 20 years for the USA, and our numbers are on a per year basis. However, this doesn't matter, so long as we assume our soldiers only served one tour of duty for simplification. In a tour, the infantryman saw about , so Conclusion So, the odds on a daily basis are pretty low: 0.08%. And that's with the high estimate. Having less than a 0.1% chance of being a casualty sounds pretty good. But over 240 days... it stacks up to a 19% chance, which is not comfortable odds for risking life and limb.
