I don't find any mention of any ships sailing with her when she sank, either companion or prize, nor any first hand accounts of the cook. I also can't find any reference to the shipwreck being located. If it was, it might be hard to identify, because there is plenty of company for it at the bottom of the Grand Banks. 1American Naval Records Society, Naval Documents of The American Revolution, Volume 10, p 1009 2Ibid, p 855-7 3Ibid, p 1050-1051 

Census data is only one tool in the arsenal that historians have for coming up with population estimates or other demographic information. From the standpoint of historiography, a census is no different than any other primary source record outside of the (sometimes questionable) assumption that it is more accurate due to government sponsorship. The key is figuring out where to look. Good places to start are tax records, military muster and conscription documents, feudal financial records, religious records (such as congregation sizes), etc. When periodic census data is available, it is useful in forming the basis for fitting the other primary source material into extrapolation curves to provide more accurate estimates of the inter-censual periods. Luckily someone else seems to have already done this leg-work - the data you are looking for likely exists, but might be difficult to track down if you are only looking online. The USDA sponsored a population survey by the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station about 10 years ago, and a paper was published on the methodology that they came up with. You can find that paper (Coulson, David P. and Joyce, Linda. United States State-Level Population Estimates: Colonization to 1999) here. The appendixes give a really good description of the statistical methods they used and have some isolated samples of both the estimates they came up with as well as some of the primary source material that was used. The resultant data set should be in the public domain (as it appears to have been prepared by U.S. government employees in the course of official duties), so you might be able to get your hands on it. 

The youngest that I can find evidence of was Irving Hanchett, executed in Florida at 15 on 5/6/1910. 

Flakpanzers and other vehicle mounted anti-aircraft guns were frequently used against ground targets, and this was in fact noted explicitly by the Military Intelligence Service in their periodic Intelligence Bulletins. The following is an excerpt they report as originating from a German anti-aircraft platoon commander: 

Conklin's experiences at the camp were relayed to the author of one of the first (or possibly the first) histories of Elmira's stint as a P.O.W. camp. In his interviews he describes constant and multiple attempts to tunnel out of the camp until shortly after the "great escape". The book is out of copyright, and is freely available on-line. 

Outside of that, it doesn't appear to have been one of the considerations. Not only did the Congress have a much more pragmatic outlook on the subject, the area under consideration with only a few square miles. Wilhelmus Bogart Bryan summed up the record of discussions regarding the jurisdiction for the federal district in writing about the response to recommendations presented to the Congress for its establishment:

Diamond pointedly notes in his critique of The Statues That Walked that Hunt and Lipo have remained completely silent about this line of research9, which is puzzling in that it was well known before they published. As to the rat theory, he dismisses it similarly to Mieth and Bork. 

The issue of representation is mentioned a little bit further in the document, and is basically pointing out that the importance of federal holdings to the nation runs counter to resident governance.

Much, much, more likely was the cultural association with certain forms and modes of dress that were correlated with prostitution - something akin to "you'd know it if you saw it". To say that Roman prostitutes wore purple (or togas, or anything else for that matter) is akin to saying that American prostitutes wear fish-net stockings. More metaphor than anything with a basis in fact. Who knows, maybe in the year 4014 somebody will post a question on whatever passes for History SE then asking if ancient American prostitutes worn them. 

Nemesis was sold in 1852, and I would presume (but can't confirm) that it was sold for scrap. I can't locate any indications that it was ever re-registered though. See Warships of the World to 1900 by Lincoln P. Paine, p 115-6 

My Latin is attrocious, but very roughly (if anyone can give a better translation, please don't hesitate) it translates to this: 

He continues by pointing out one of the difficulties in accepting an even more rapid migration - it left residual communities along the way. In fact, he contrasts this later in the paper to the seemingly more rapid movement of the Clovis population southward into the areas around present day New Mexico, and notes the lack of intermediary settlement as one of the substantiating reasons. 

So likely, the answer is likely a combination of all of the things you mentioned, combined with a very healthy dose of not knowing much of anything about the Maya beyond brief examinations of the ruins. In fact, Stephens wildly underestimates the age of some of the sites: 

It was basically a business decision. The Dutch West India Company had a large financial stake in the success of the colony, and ensuring that new settlers were treated with "moderation" was seen as necessary. The official response of The Dutch West India Company was the following letter signed by Abraham Wilmandone and David Von Baerle on April 16th, 1663: 

Even more effective than the light calibre anti-aircraft guns were the eighty-eights, which were used against ground targets throughout the war. For example against the British and French during the Battle of France in 1940... 

None of Gustav's correspondence around the time makes mention of the event either, but that is to be expected - having one's horse shot out from underneath you is not horribly dignifying for a monarch. It also would not be that uncommon, but would still be noteworthy. This makes the event conspicuously missing in the Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon (see pages 1655-6 from October 10-11). What is notable is that Gordon, a Scottish officer in the service of Gustav, records that his horse was shot from under him shortly before the surrender of Kraków. In the editor's paraphrase: 

I would have to say no, but there is quite a bit of primary literature about the attire of prostitutes in ancient Rome. The more scholarly debate on Roman prostitutes' attire is the dispute as to whether prostitutes in Rome wore togas as a distinctive garment, and much of the contemporary texts distinguishes only between matrona (a "respectible" woman) togata (ostensibly a prostitute or adulteress). A good example, and the closest I can find to anything approaching a reference to purple is Martial's Epigrams 2.39, where he writes: 

As for where Gendrop came up with the notion that the Maya were an "eminently peaceful people", it probably wouldn't have been from Stephens. Much of the impression that Stephens forms of the Maya implies a strong cultural continuity with the Aztec, and he acknowledges the accounts of Cortez as historically accurate, including his references to human sacrifice and territorial conflicts. 

Their correspondence eventually led to a meeting in New York between Paine and Anatoli Blagonravov, chair of the Soviet Academy's Commission on Exploration and Use of Space, where Paine mentioned that Armstrong would be visiting the COSPAR meeting. 

There are also numerous first person accounts, for example this one from John Angier describing an action in Alsace-Lorraine in late 1944 when serving with the 100th Infantry Division: 

While Madison is referring most directly to military installations, the inference is likely one that can be extended to the seat of government. To understand the connection between security and seat of government, the context of the decision-making process about locating the proceedings of the Congress is important. The bulk of the debate took place around October of 1783, and was in part precipitated by Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783. Under the Articles of Confederacy, the Congress relied on the Pennsylvania militia to provide security. The Pennsylvania Council chose not to do so, and allowed an angry mob to march on the Congressional proceedings. Also, the role of being able to come to a compromise on where the seat of government should be located was likely a big part - on October 6, 1783 motions to house the Congress in each of the 13 states were voted down.3 About the only mention I can find from around this period is again from Madison, this time in a letter to Edmund Randolph dated September 20, 1783: 

The use of anti-aircraft weapons against infantry appears to be at very least an informal doctrine in the German military, as they also include in the same intelligence briefing this account cited as coming from a German newspaper:
