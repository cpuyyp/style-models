The islands are floating at rain cloud level. Every time they float through a cloud, they have a good chance of triggering precipitation (rain), similar to how mountains tend to encourage precipitation IRL. 

Patterns repeat all the time in nature, e.g. the moon continues to maintain the same orbit around the Earth and we continually see the same cycle of New-moon - Crescent - Half-moon - Full-moon regularly, and also causes the tides to come in and out with the same period every time, even though there is no sentience involved. There's no reason why, depending on the nature of the warping, the crystals don't keep passing each other at the same vectors every time (as they are each moving on their own repeating pattern which is dictated by something akin to an orbit or something), and therefore create the same shaped monsters. 

"I'm an elf trapped inside a human body" Just as you have trans-gender people now, you could have trans-racial people... 

Given advanced enough telescopic technology, would it be possible to detect that a planet in the order of 50 light years away is inhabitable? (i.e. without having to actually go there) I'm just looking for the basics here - presence of water, enough oxygen in the atmosphere, temperature, and sunlight (perhaps a bit dimmer than on Earth but still bearable) and assume the technology exists to "fine tune" i.e. remove unexpected toxic gasses from the atmosphere, turn the local algae into plant-growing soil, etc. But here is the hard part, my scenario involves such a planet that people on Earth decided to colonise, but once they got there, they discovered that it wasn't inhabitable at all - lifeless and without atmosphere like the Moon, as well as unbearably cold and as dark as say, here on Earth in the moonlight. So my question is, what could lead advanced astronomers to make such a mistake despite being really confident in their initial belief? I'd prefer an answer where the astronomers got it wrong, rather than circumstances changing during the journey (e.g. a Solar flare destroying the atmosphere or something) Edit after a bit of thinking time I've been thinking that a huge undetected magnetic cloud made of handwavium particles between us and them could disrupt the light coming to us, messing with frequencies, etc. However, I think this would make the planet appear darker than it really is - I want it to appear brighter than it really is. Is there any kind of lensing effect something like this could have that would make either the local stars (it's a binary system) or the planet's own reflected light seem brighter? Maybe it could make the planet look closer to the star than it really is and they would deduce that the planet is brighter than it actually is? It is OK if the astronomers involved are not 100% sure that they are right. External pressures will force them to launch the mission anyway. Also, there are no aliens any more advanced than maybe plant life. 

There are also the factors which have nothing to do with the planet itself: Economics of the galactic system. Doesn't matter how "valuable" something is, if no one can afford the high price, its value comes down. How many competitive bidders? The value can change vastly depending on whether there is one unopposed corporation looking to buy it as opposed to several who might be competing for it. Could the Vogons impose a compulsory purchase order? 

No WW2 / Cold War This is the answer to a lot of "How to prevent technology" questions! There are plenty of reasons why a people might not develop space travel - probably more than why they would! Look at why the Earthlings went to space. It's not just a natural progression of technology, it was a very specific circumstances, namely that the USA and USSR both got hold of German rocket technology (which itself was only developed to fight WW2), and then both had reasons to fear the other, as well as trying to build the prestige of their very way of life over the other, and so had the motive and the ability to pour huge resources into what seemed like an otherwise an extremely costly achievement without much return on investment. You could also take away the Moon - such a close celestial body would have had an inspiring effect on would-be space scientists over the centuries - giving people a goal to aim for. 

So a "Narnia" type situation? This doesn't exactly answer but gives another way of looking at it which could help you: The travellers' brains and bodies have somehow sped up the reaction and aging process by a factor of 10 due to high concentrations of phlebotinium. Think of what's experienced by a fly. Now there are still some factors to explain away - like any clocks or computers that they may have brought with them... Maybe they crashed landed and all chronometers were destroyed. There is other stuff like the length of a day and a year, etc. of course... 

There may be peace here, but that's no reason why your warrior clans can't sail to far off lands looking for treasures and spoils, etc. possibly like the European empires. Your dwarven clan may send its members off on expeditions to retrieve treasures which they bring back and trade for food (perhaps the have a rotating "tour of duty"), and may have to fight with natives. Likewise your Orcish clans may do the same thing. In fact they might even meet in whatever "new world" they go to plunder and fight bloody battles there, even though technically they are at peace here. Another idea is that it may be peace time but it's an uneasy peace, similar to the Cold War. Both Orcs and Dwarves have convinced their people that the standing army is the only thing stopping the other side from coming in and wiping out / enslaving / subjugating their race. 

It seems to me that in this system, your minor God is not very different from a minor politician trying to rise to power. Compare Hitler's rise to power, starting in small beer halls and gaining more and more followers. He must start at the grass-roots level, taking care of his existing worshipers to extent of his power, (suffering a drought? that drizzle might seem useful then) but not solving all their problems (he still wants them to think they need his help). That as well as spouting his own propaganda. He should target other minor Gods around his level or lower (he doesn't want to piss off the bigger Gods just yet), blaming them for certain social ills he has identified, to try and poach some of their followers. He could also make vague promises/prophecies about glory and plenty to his followers. Just highlight some obvious looking flaws which seem to have simple fixes, even if the fixes are a lot more complex than they look (which they probably are which is why they haven't already been made) Identify his more powerful followers, and focus most of his power on trying to help them (e.g. cure a local Lord's child's terminal disease or something) as they should drag commoners with them. When he gets powerful enough to perform a miracle, make it high profile. e.g. He may find he gets more thanks for wiping out a plague of rats with a rainbow blast of lightning than he does from persuading the mayor to implement hygiene reform... 

I'm thinking that you're not asking how to justify black people in the setting, but more how to convince people who are used to reading about the stereotypical whites-only fantasy worlds to accept black characters as normal. This is probably more a question for Writers SE. My advice is not to worry about it - use existing tropes and clich√©s as inspiration, not as rules or dogma. It's better to get into your mind that you are not trying to write the same story that's already been written in a thousand books and ten thousand D&D campaigns. And if you're still worried about it, then just establish it early on as unremarkable. e.g. an early chapter has a character participating in the story as any character would and happens to be black. Throw in a descriptive sentence about the sun / his wife caressing his brown skin or something... Besides - not that I've come across any - I'm sure that in this day in age there are plenty of works out there set in the Tolkienesque fantasy setting with "real-life" races other than Anglo-Saxon. 

Pronouns for all! First consider a conversation involving a small number of people, e.g. two people talking and the subject is a third person (male) and possibly a fourth person (female). Assuming both sides are aware of the context, this entire conversation can be carried out without names! We have I, you, he and she. Of course those pronouns will refer to completely different people in another conversation. Other languages have further pronouns which refer to seniority or familiarity (e.g. vous and tu in French). Now imagine the relatively small tribe have hundreds of pronouns in their language, referring to different aspects of people (e.g. their relationship with the person doing the talking, male or female, whether they are older or more senior than the speaker, whether they live near the speaker, etc.). It might seem to get very confusing, but the upshot might be that they can refer to almost anyone in the tribe with a combination of context and these pronouns and maybe a little clarification here and there ("No, I meant he with the moustache, not he who once ate the superhot chili"). But it works because the people of the tribe know each other so well. They rarely meet outsiders and so there is a very small range of pronouns to refer to one - maybe just one or two words. Now the Caliph comes along and asks "Who did this?" and the tribesman uses one of these pronouns to identify the guilty party, and as an outsider, the Caliph hasn't a clue who they are referring to. So the Caliph asks someone else, who uses a completely different pronoun. Now he is really confused. Of course, he could very easily gather everyone together and have someone point to the culprit or have the witness bring him to them - but that seems out of the scope of the question. 

First: a problem that this law would solve. e.g. imagine a dystopian world where damage is done, conflicts arise, but lawsuits are unenforceable, or possibly there are no lawsuits because no one respects the courts enough to hold them, show up, or care what a judge might say. So many conflicts go unresolved and boil over into violence, vigilantism, lynch-mobs, etc. There is chaos as innocent bystanders get caught up in it, there are sneak attacks, people form gangs of friends to outnumber and kill the other person, etc. Second: a popular revolution. The revolution sorts out the dystopia, and brings the chaotic anarchy under control. One of the things it tries to take control of is this type of violent conflict resolution. They still don't introduce the concept of law-suits because of reasons like... 

What if the plates were actually regularly shaped "rings" around the planet (with "caps" at the poles) which when put together form the sphere that is the crust of the planet but which can move independently. Each continent would reside on one of these rings, but although they would pass each other (as they turn at different speeds), they would never collide except for maybe a minor north-south wobble. Perhaps the gravity of a large and close satellite keeps the ones at the equator moving quickly, while the ones closer to the poles not so quick, similar to the moon and our tides? (And may be responsible for how they fell into that pattern in the first place) I have no idea if the stress on these rings would mean they could not maintain their shape, but even if they were broken it still works as long as the parts kept moving in the same direction. 

Not much One of your caveats is a world of "savages", where people are willing to go around killing each other just because they can. This is a big part of the answer. So society is already changed from our society - there's a reason humans don't go around killing each other, and it's not just because it's too difficult or they're afraid of getting caught. There's a social and genetic advantage to want to protect your own kind, form friendships, relationships, alliances, communities, and not kill each other, etc. and the fact we have this trait is partially responsible for how we got to the civilised society we have now. So imagining a different world where people are willing to go around killing each other, and how that would change if this new condition is added. It wouldn't be much different from people not having this power, except without this power they'd be using stones, knives or clubs instead of fists. A difference would be that people would get even more paranoid than they are, since now you know that someone entering your hut/cave is not only willing to kill you but has permanent access to a weapon - as do you - but the question is who uses it first. But it doesn't matter much - it's unlikely that civilisation would advance even to the point of using language, never mind modern technology, if everyone is afraid of other people being about to kill them. Even before this disease came along, a weapon could be acquired fairly quickly. Police forensic/investigation techniques are a modern invention, so in early human society you'd have probably got away with it fairly easily anyway, and it's unlikely technology would ever advance as far as things like fingerprints or even organised investigation as a concept. In any case, with no taboo on killing, it's doubtful anyone would ever care enough to investigate it or punish someone responsible anyway. 

Could the potion be modified somehow so that it can't survive for long (more than a few seconds) outside the specialised (and very distinctive looking) bottle? Anyone drinking it must swallow it almost immediately or it won't work. This will prevent spiking drinks, and it will also prevent coercion as someone being forced to drink it could hold it in their mouth for a few seconds before swallowing. 

You could use grains of sand. e.g. they can only hold 20 or so grains of sand in their hands. If you explicitly refer to the grains as grains of sand it'll be clear to the reader that they aren't just normal sized people and larger pebbles. Or snowflakes. 

If you want to speak in private, go to the dance floor of a busy and noisy night club. Unless someone bugs the ear of the person you're talking to, they'll have no way of hearing what you're saying. For other private meetings, hide in the crowd. Meet at a big event like a crowded concert or football match - obviously not where seats are pre-booked, but where everyone is just herded in to a tight location. The AI will most likely be only able to see your head and shoulders, so any suspicious transacting can go on below the waist. 

Continuing with the migration / refugee idea, you could abduct boat-loads of migrants at a time currently crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Anyone who noticed them missing would just assume that their boat has sunk as is tragically happening at the moment. Could be done out of sight of everyone and with minimal investigation. 

Dragons are big, they can fly and they can breathe fire. All that requires a huge amount of energy, so their weakness is that they have to eat a huge amount - probably why they are attacking in the first place (Though one would imagine farms with cows and big animals would be better food sources than cities, perhaps they attack castles & cities to try to wipe out the land's defenses so they can feed on farms with impunity) If the dragon is beginning to starve, perhaps he doesn't have the strength to fly, or to breathe fire as hot or as much as he otherwise would. 

It's quite easy to have extremely advanced space travel and yet not have the Internet or social media. The two have nothing to do with each other, other than they were both created by the Cold War. In fact, as Quentin Clarkson answered, space travel was invented first! The Internet as we know it now with its Facebooks and Youtubes and Googles came from a quite specific sequence of situations, without which we probably wouldn't even imagine them. First of all, the cold war lead the US military to develop a communications network which was the framework for the Internet, then the notion of using this network for educational institutes to share knowledge, then the popularity of the World Wide Web, multimedia and general entertainment (especially illegal downloads, porn, network gaming) lead to the widespread use of the Internet and fueled a large industry in telecommunications research and development and the invention and popularisation of smart phones. Take any of that away and you don't have what we know today as the Internet, and if it even exists it's certainly not within the hands of the general public (so Social Networking means going to the pub and talking to people). This has absolutely nothing to do with Space Travel other than that was also motivated by the Cold War. Perhaps the crews of spaceships would benefit from a high-performance communications network, but it would have no reason to spread beyond that. Just as a side note, if their planet's gravity is lower than ours, then space travel becomes a lot easier...
