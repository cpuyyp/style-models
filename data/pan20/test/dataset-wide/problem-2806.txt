In Mathematics, we as an undergraduate are exposed for the first time (at least for me it was the case) to 'rigor'. For example, in Real Analysis classes we often use logical quantifiers in our arguments. However, the curious thing is that even though we are told to use formal reasoning in our arguments we are never told explicitly the reason behind using formal reasoning. For example, in philosophical arguments the method of reasoning is not always formal and I think that it is more natural to use this kind of reasoning method. Surprisingly enough when we discuss the proofs, we in fact use this kind of informal reasoning but still our professors insist on being able to write formal proofs. This makes me wonder, 

Yesterday I was talking to one of my mathematics professor regarding the notion of proof in general (whatever the word "general" means to the reader). In short my claim was, 

In Margaris's book First Order Mathematical Logic we have the following, However, the difference between an axiom and an axiom scheme is not clearly stated there in the sense that in the book it is not clearly specified exactly what is(are) the property (or properties) that help us to distinguish between an axiom and an axiom scheme. To elaborate the problem a bit, consider the following question, 

Now, let me explain how I came to this seemingly paradoxical idea. Please correct me if my argument is wrong. 

In his book Beyond the Limits of Thought while talking about Russell's solution of paradoxes Graham Priest writes (text made bold, footnotes and references omitted), 

When I argued like this the professor told me that he thinks that the question is merely wordplay. When I asked him the reason he wasn't able to give me an answer that satisfies me. So, basically my questions are two, 

The fallacy isn't in that calling Bob smelly is rude; as far as logic goes, that's perfectly fine. The problem's that Bob's odor doesn't typically have anything to do with statements he might make, e.g. X. That said, it's still possible for this to not be a fallacy. For example, if it's: 

So, obviously, something must exist within a debate to be a fallacy within it. For example, someone can turn on a TV, but if that's not part of a debate, it can't be a fallacy or non-fallacy within it. The main point of this post is that folks might be confused due to the assumption that all words in an exchange in which a debate occurs are necessarily part of the debate. But, that's the basic mistake. Instead, people can exchange words, including having one-or-more debates, without all words being part of all of the on-going dialogs. This is like how a computer can play music from the internet while a user is checking their email; the email app and music app are both streaming info over the same serial line, but the music doesn't exist in the email app nor do the emails exist in the music app. 

Here, they're not making a statement. It's not even a bad question - if you don't like a product, then potential buyers might have good reason to be interested in why you use it despite not liking it. Rudeness isn't ad hominem There's a somewhat common misconception that rudeness is a fallacy; it's not. Ad hominem is where someone reasons something like: 

Not to say that this is polite or acceptable in moderated venues, e.g. on StackExchange, however it'd be logically correct. On moderated venues, it may simply be easier to stop responding. This also has drawbacks in cases due to the public nature of such forums, though I guess various constraints limit how much can be effectively communicated anyway. 

In his article The Pernicious Influence of Mathematics upon Philosophy (see Chapter 12 of this book) Rota says (my emphasis), 

"Take, for example, the law of excluded middle: every proposition is either true or false . Since this has a quantifier over all propositions, it cannot be expressed." - I don't understand why "this" has a quantifier over all propositions. So far in any modern representations of (Classical) First Order Logic, I haven't seen (nor can I remember) the LEM being represented as such. Indeed, after what Conifold says here, I don't understand what Priest means when he claims that "it cannot be expressed". How is he able to claim so? "Or, closer to home, consider the Axiom of Reducibility itself. This is supposed to hold for all functions, f. Russell's very statement of it (above) therefore violates the theory of orders." - How exactly does Russell's statement of Axioms of Reducibility violates the theory of orders? "Even decent statements of the VCP cannot be made without violating the VCP since they must say that for any function, f, any propositional function which 'involves' f cannot be an argument for f. Such statements are impossible by Russell's own admission." - As I understand, here also Priest's objection relies on the use of "for any function". If this is so, then as I have asked in my first question, it is not clear to me as why does he claim that "[e]ven decent statements of the VCP cannot be made without violating the VCP". If this is not the case then what did Priest intend to mean here? "For, however we express it, what we are supposed to understand by a systematically ambiguous formula, such as the formal statement of the Axiom of Reducibility above, is exactly what would be obtained by prefixing the formula with a universal quantifier '∀f', ranging over all functions." - I am not so sure that "what we are supposed to understand by a systematically ambiguous formula, such as the formal statement of the Axiom of Reducibility above, is exactly what would be obtained by prefixing the formula with a universal quantifier '∀f" (in fact this doubt was partly responsible for my asking the first question). Indeed, to me Russell's suggestion sounds similar (see the quote) to that of Conifold's remark that I mentioned earlier. Am I missing something important and/or subtle here? 

On the one hand, it is claimed that one should not depend solely on the judgement of people of authority, but rather try to verify their opinions and learn independent thinking. It is claimed that the fact that a person of authority says X does not yet constitute an argument for X. On the other hand, many times it would seem that the contrary is true. Trying to apply one's own reasoning can lead to preventing from learning; as it would seem that, especially in the first stages of learning, absorbtion of other people's knowlege, rather than questioning it, is a necessity - even if the learner cannot yet prove this knowledge themselves. Also, insisting on proving or understanding each piece of accepted knowledge is practically infeasible. In some areas, proponing the recourse of authority has been brought up to eleven. In cryptography, for example, it is strongly encouraged to only use tools brought by experts. This general prohibition of doing virtually anything on one's own seems even more harsh than the usual recourse to authority, which only prohibits doing what experts explicitly discourage. (source: see eight numbered links in the top of this question). It would seem that statements really are much more likely to be true just because an expert said them, as opposed to statements said by the ignorant - and this seems precisely what argument from authority fallacy disclaims. 

Yes I know for many folks this is obvious, but please stick with me. I am not trying to promote any sort of discrimination here. One of the quite a few believes that are being spearheaded nowadays and that I have quite a trouble of understanding is that we should strive to achieve a roughly 50%-50% ratio of genders across each occupation. So if, for example, it turns out that only 1/4 IT specialists are women, then it is clear that there is much work to be done and we should promote women in IT until around 1/2 IT specialists are women. There are many examples of such thinking, one of them being the relatively recent SO blog post. I can't help but I have feeling that such thinking misses one very important point and that is that whether we like it or not there are important differences from birth between men and women. These differences manifest themselves in the fact that there seems to be a very clear statistical skew: there are tasks that most women can perform much better than most men and there are tasks that most women can perform much worse than most men. Another even more important statistical skew is that there are tasks that most women are much more interested in than most men, and there are task that most women are much less interested in than most men. Science only continues to find more and more of such correlations; a few non-exhaustive lists are: 1, 2, 3. There are, of course, exceptions to these rules. History does have a cast of women who displayed great passion for stereotypically "male" tasks, like hard science or even warfare, and who excelled at these tasks. Such women are nevertheless in a stark minority. Of course, in the past sexual discrimination was very prominent. Nowadays, however, it is not. Even if there are remnants of the past discrimination in the thinking of male workers in certain occupations, there are leveraged by a powerful feminist movement that promotes women in such occupations and chastising all real or exaggerated examples of sexism. In spite of these efforts the statistical minority of women in these occupations persists. In the light of all of the above I would say that applying any further pressure to increase the prevalence of women in, for example, IT, to 50% is, paradoxically, anti-women. If the long desired 50%-50% ratio was finally to be achieved, this would necessarily mean that we would have pushed to IT women who would be more intersted in other tasks, like even the long disdained "housewifing", and are unhappy at their current IT job and for this reason can't do it well; women, who have been denied the chance to find out they'd be much happier in a different occupation because in the name of gender equality they have been pushed to IT. Alternatively, we could, as some propose in politics, enforce the 50%-50% ratio by prohibiting hiring or electing (in politics) more men as long as we don't have enough women (that is, to apply reverse discrimination); but this would either end up with the same result or with a dramatic cut of workforce because we would have to forcibly push many competent and willing men out of these industries (perhaps forcing these men to do what they don't want and can't do, like babysitting, again in the name of gender equality). If I were to work in an IT company I would be more than happy to work with a competent woman who enjoys her work and I can only wholeheartedly support opening the doors of the industry to such women. Conversely, if I had a deep passion for teching children in elementary schools and could do it well, I would like to be welcomed there by all of the women working there. This is because there will always be a healthy minority of men enjoying stereotypically women tasks and women enjoying stereotypically men tasks. However, I would say, forcing these proportions to even out in the name of gender equality can only end in disastreous results. Or in other words: There should be no obstacles for women in tech, but women should likely be not promoted or encouraged to join the tech industry either. What are the standard responses of promoters of gender equality to such arguments? 

Yes, you can imagine new "colors", and there are physically meaningful complex colors that humans don't really see. Short version We see with our eyes, and those signals go back to our brains. We ascribe "color" to things that we see as colors are common patterns worth noting and exploiting, e.g. for communication. Since this question is about imagining a new color, sure, you can imagine a description that doesn't correspond to anything else that you've seen. In the absence of correspondence to physical reality, this would seem to be a pointless exercise, but there's no reason why you can't imagine it. Additionally, there're physically meaningful "colors" that we actually observe in science labs. However, you can't really "see" these colors directly as the human brain's visual processing center isn't wired to process them. Colors with more dimensions Another answer had mentioned the prospect of tetrachromacy which is sorta how animals with more sensory inputs can see things; they'd have a wider color space. However, this strikes me as a limited perspective because that seems to suggest that there's something special about seeing color in just 4 dimensions. You can perform a Fourier transform on a source of light waves to get infinitely many dimensions of color as opposed to just the 3 in human vision or the 4 in tetrachromacy. We've even built machines that do exactly this, i.e. Fourier transform spectrometers. It's somewhat difficult for a human mind to appreciate such complex "colors" in the same sense that we perceive normal colors though. For example, here's a very high dimensional color for a blue flame. Assuming that this plot uses 1 data point per /nm on the x-axis from 300/nm to 700/nm, then that's a 401-dimensional color. Even if you were to see the blue flame yourself, it'd look blue to your eyes, as your eyes don't have the spectrometer's mechanisms for seeing more. However, you can see the color through the spectrometer's eyes by observing the spectrum showed in the link. If you want to imagine it in your own eyes, it'll look like a blue flame, since that's what it is; but if you want to rewrite how your mind works, you might try to appreciate that it's a far more complex color than just "blue". Science note: The reason that we have such spectrometers is because more detailed colors can tell more about what you're looking at. In many labs, spectroscopy is the go-to method for identifying chemical compounds and other physical samples. Not much art When people talk about imagining new colors, I suspect that they're generally looking for something aesthetically pleasing. The problem here is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; you can imagine a Fourier-transform-like visual apparatus, which would see in vastly more colors than humans normally do, but since imagining such complex colors would require a lot of work and rewiring one's own brain, it's doubtful that an observer would find aesthetic joy in it. Aesthetics seem to work best when an observer can relate to what they see on some level. Unheard of colors, such as high-dimensional colors from spectrometers, probably won't match up to this for most folks. Color blindness Some people can't perceive colors like normal, i.e. they're color-blind. At least in some cases, this results from the eyes lacking the physical hardware to pick up on some of the color signals. Looking through Google, it appears that some folks are claiming that they're getting close to a cure for some sorts of color blindness, presumably by fixing the eyes. Once a life-long color-blind person has their eyes fixed, will their brains be able to fully process and appreciate the color distinctions as though their eyes had picked up on the signals all along, or will their brains have pruned the unused informational channels?
