You're definitely on the right path with wanting to dig into raw data yourself. RAP has always been a pretty solid source of useful basic data. But in terms of making sense of the data, it indeed will take some practice. You can feel like you're not getting it at all, but suddenly pieces will start to click, much like riding a bike. Basically, you need to start building from those that know these things. As such, one good insight can be in reading NWS forecast discussions, which you can find among the rich data at kamala.cod.edu or in one big set at this NWS link. But, at least in terms of storms, I think the place to start has to be the same place that the CWG article relied upon: the Storm Prediction Center. Specifically: 

In terms of "a lot", at least for tornadoes/hail, I'd suggest that nowhere west of the Rockies sees a lot truly: 

What this graphic says is that basically winds at the ocean are 15-60% increased from typical land values. Even more upsetting to being coastal is the 8 days less than 52 km/hr that you mention. You're in a location reasonably mid-latitude, so you've traditionally got the big wind storms that often affect the coastal areas, such as Nor'Easters, and Bering Sea cyclones. I'd think it'd be hard to find an oceanic city that doesn't get above 52 km/hr more than 8 days during a year outside the tropics (assuming you're talking about short burst of 52 km/hr and not daily averages, but even daily averages I'd think might surpass 52 km/hr 8 days per year in the majority of seaboard cities). So I'd be surprised to see that it is truly a coastal location. However there are a couple places with connections to water that might fit still. 1 - Near inland seas\lakes would have somewhat lower wind because of the diminished water fetch available and the decreased percentage of the year that wind flows over such water. 2 - The transition zone from marine winds to land winds is probably only something like 10-100 miles, while temperature moderation is still significant, even moreso if there is water on many sides. Because your temperature range is only indeed 31 C (56 F) wide, that certainly does seem to still suggest it has significant moisture influences. Now, 21 C seems a fairly cool value (especially if that's the absolute maximum daytime peak during the year, but even an average of 21 seems a tad cool, especially for cities not right on the water. So that suggests to me that it's pretty far north, or perhaps abuts rather cool waters. So, looking at the map, and based upon those ideas, I'd think the favorite might be inland Russia or China... or maybe around Italy\Greece. Just the right city location in the northern US or Canada might work too, like Portland (Oregon), Detroit, or Ottawa. 

Some historical standards formed due to instrumentation. Cloud cover observations were setup based upon okta, which are eighth fractions of the sky covered overhead during the past hour (perhaps 8 observations were taken/recorded by early instruments/observers). This lead to the United States National Weather Service using this table for reporting and forecasting: 

So, WHY are fronts low pressure areas? It goes to its nature in connection to winds. Consider the images below: 

[where R is the ideal gas constant of the gas under consideration and T is temperature in Kelvin] This would allow you replace the unknown density, and you'd then end up with: w = −ωRT/pg Which you could then either further approximate R to be that for dry air = Rd = 287 J/Kkg, or even work up the adjustment your moisture content variable causes (though don't think doing so would offer much useful improvement as you've already got greater errors due to the failings of the hydrostatic approximation). Since you don't have temperature, it seems your only remaining option would be to plug in the density approximation for the level of interest from the approximated "Standard Atmosphere" here (use the table where ρ is in units of kg/m^3). It has been a long while since I've done this stuff, but I don't see any better options. Unless somehow there's a way to work from the geopotential, maybe apply something like mass continuity in pressure coordinates, and get to something more complex to return something more correct for w. But if there is, it outpaces me! So, long story short, it appears that your best hope is w = −ωRT/pg, but it won't be 100% reliable, particularly in strong convection. 

When the NWS uses "dm" is that short for "dam" as in decameters, or something else? And if so, why do they sometimes give these heights rather than the millibars? 

71% of Earth's surface is covered with water and 29% land. Thinking in that regard, that's saying that on 29% of Earth's "surface" locations you have land below your feet, and in 71% of the locations, you have water. So to continue in such terms, you'd then ask... ok, what percentage of Earth's surface locations would have air above them!?! Well that's all of them. So to if you're comparing it with those percentages, I guess you'd have to say it's another 100%. Or, if we put them together into a full 3-dimensional surroundings at the surface, well it'd basically be 50% air, 36% water, 14% land. But to compare how much of each there REALLY is, you need to include depth, getting some sort of 3 dimensional understanding of it. But the picture that reveals is certainly not the picture we are used to from daily experience. From the values I was able to find: 

Correction: There were actually 4 categories prior to the change. The SPC used the "See Text" area for what is now designated as a "Marginal Risk". These did not have colors or outlines, but instead just the words "See Text" on the map. Note that the "See Text" area actually did have a "hidden" outline, in the tornado\hail\wind risk percentage contours that went in hand with them, as in: 

Asking this is a bit like asking something like "which young athlete should a sports team draft/sign to have the best results"... There are hints towards which ways to go: (best physical skillsets and athleticism) / (a corridor of very warm SST, limited land, low-ish shear) But identifying the optimal situation is incredibly impossible, as most of it comes down to evolution factors that are nuanced (how the player develops) / (subtle interactions with surrounding systems, inner-core evolution, how winds channel over land and impact key buildings) In the end, we're not even that great at forecasting how a storm will intensify or weaken in the upcoming hours (much worse at it than at track forecasts, and not seeing significant improvements). The best hints are probably found in past category 5 hurricanes and top supertyphoons... generally they've had fairly steady motion (to prevent overturning the warm ocean waters), had well positioned outflow channels, and formed and had subsequent tracks over great amounts of warm water and away from significant land/mountainous terrain. Generally most have undergone rapid intensification. But it's very difficult to maintain anything near category 5 winds on Earth for very long even in ideal conditions; eyewall replacement cycles typically cause fluctuations in even the most perfect storms. The mad scientist would think that maybe one could just weave storms around warm water regions for long periods of time carefully, and surely a stronger storm could eventually develop. But a storm doesn't just turn at whim, but based upon the winds brought from the larger storm systems around it. And the changes of those "background" winds don't just alter the storm's direction, but change the shear and instability in the storm itself. It's nowhere near as simple as just flipping a switch, even ideally. Plus the top ocean temperatures often take weeks or more to recover after a strong storm passes, so you'd likely have to be an amazing navigator like this. You can get a rough estimate of the possible regions in play using the maximum potential intensity theory from Dr. Kerry Emanuel, which analyzes the physical limitations to the heat engine process that hurricanes are. Here are real-time maps of these values. But in the end, any game allowing you to try to create the perfect storm would be like trying to manipulate the future to your wishes: good luck! 

Notice how the ground winds are usually highest in the afternoon and evening, as mixing averages out with the winds higher up, before reducing as the night goes on. So when talking about regions near mountains... during the day, there is a lot more motion in general. And thus stronger winds mix down into the valley. Plus, often as that stronger wind flows up the mountainside, they'll cool too much, and sink back into the valley. So winds from above affect the valley, and winds from the sides likely affect it more as well. At many times there may not be as much of the up and down as you've drawn... but other than that, it looks more like your top figure because of the mixing. Whereas at night, wind near the surface start to calm. In valleys, the additional blocking of winds often cause it to calm even more quickly, as there quickly isn't even horizontal mixing to keep things active. That's why at night even small valleys can often get quite a bit colder than surrounding areas on nights where there's little synoptic wind [wind due to larger storm systems]. But even on most slightly windy evenings, it's likely that the winds in valleys are calmer than on the mountains (which tend to be much higher than other places on Earth), and also probably calmer than similar areas in the Plains. 

Don't know if it's perfect for you, as the GFS resolution is around 30 km, so even at maximum resolution it's going to lump some mountains and lower areas together. A pity Pivotal Weather also is a little zoomed out in your area. If you were really wanting to go all in, you could definitely dig up the data files to download the data directly out of the model for peak resolution and information. Otherwise if content, you can just check each day (or every 6 hours) and compare to the previous image (which you can pull up in the dropdown on Pivotal's site). Satellite data: I was able to come across one satellite that does offer a snow analysis product, the NASA TERRA/MODIS pair. On that same page they have a further link to download the data at 0.05 degree resolution, which would be less than 1 km!!! I have no idea how good these plots are, but the potential sounds great. 

And there's plenty of other great things there too; climatologies, publications, education pages, etc. Now, obviously the majority of this information focuses most directly on severe weather setups (though the SPC does actually also issue winter weather mesoscale discussions [the WPC now does heavy rain MDs, and of course the NHC does the main discussions on tropical systems]), and only regard US events. But these tools can really help even those interested more in other areas and topics get a better understanding of the bigger picture, which sync up well into just about every topic of synoptic and mesoscale meteorology, regardless of location. Now, in terms of helping you personally narrow down onto the key elements, so that you could make your own composite map... the classic ingredients necessary for thunderstorms (also see here) can be a good starting point: 

Showing you're pretty limited in your lightning up that way. But the time map does show some locations in western New York are more night-focused than many places in the US. Looks like it's heavily caused by the lake. Over the lake the cool lake air should squash instability of incoming storms on warm afternoons. Lake breezes might extend that lull somewhat further inland, though it would also feasibly kick off storms as they advance, too. But I really doubt lake breezes up that way often get deeply developed enough to move inland and have a lot of influence during the summer. I don't see any radar evidence over the past few days of any. Thinking some of the late-night lightning further inland, especially along the Tug Hill, might actually stem from the major lake effect snow events. I'd think that such events might often be strongest at night because air-lake temperature difference is vital to LES, and temperatures are lowest at night of course (winds often slacken at night, potentially mitigating this, but I believe most LES, especially on the eastern shores, come in situations with strong synoptic flow, where nighttime wind decrease shouldn't be much of an issue). Not sure if you get enough thundersnow to really sway the needle towards night-time lightning. Maybe as you cool at night, storms fire over the lake at night, equivalent to landbreezes. Seems it may be a combination of factors that cause your fairly local peculiarity, but hopefully these ideas/factors offer at least a bit of insight!
