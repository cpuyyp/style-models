What counts as practical? Suppose that somebody claims that the material world you see around you is an illusion. It doesn't really exist. Theories about biology, physics etc are just instruments for prediction not attempts to describe reality. The trouble with this idea is that unless you take theories seriously as a description of reality, it is difficult to find flaws in them or even to explain why you would want to find flaws in them. So such an idea makes progress in understanding the world difficult. So then the pragmatist would say you should take them seriously as a description of how the world works. But then you have a problem. What about the cases in which those theories predict that there are some events you will never experience. For example, if some event takes place in the past so you can only see the results, e.g. - a dinosaur died and was not fossilized. So then somebody might say only the results matter not how it happened. But the event took place according to the relevant theories and should be taken seriously as a description of reality by that token. So what position should the pragmatist take and why? The way out of this problem is to ditch pragmatism. You should find out how the world works, and what values you should pursue. Then work you can work out what is practical. Any attempt to do the reverse puts the cart before the horse. 

Marxism explains behaviour in terms of classes, not individuals. It also attributes the same interests to all members of a class. This makes no sense since being a worker or capitalist or whatever is a role. As a result, a person can play either role at different times, or both at the same time. Lots of people have a day job and some investments: they work and provide capital. See: $URL$ As for the deprivation of individual liberty, there is no way to reconcile any variety of socialism I have ever heard of with liberty. Under capitalism, a person may decline to take responsibility for the maintenance and use of capital. He can choose just to come into work, do what his employer asks and leave at the end of the day. If he doesn't like his work, he can either change his preferences so he does like his work or find other work he prefers. Or he can choose to go into business himself so he doesn't have anybody asking him to do specific tasks in return for money: he can choose his own tasks if somebody is willing to pay for what he does. Under socialism, he is obliged to own the means of production and to take responsibility for them. He might prefer to spend that effort looking after his children or playing computer games or whatever, but his preferences are irrelevant. He is forced to take responsibility he does not want. And somebody who would like to start any sort of business is in even worse shape. If he can't get the approval of every worker for his plans then he is sunk. For a detailed discussion of the economic and some moral problems of socialism see "Socialism" by Ludwig von Mises and "Time will run back" by Henry Hazlitt. 

It's a bit unclear whether you realise that there is a distinction between psychiatry and psychoanalysis. Some people who called themselves psychoanalysts refused to coerce their patients, see e.g. - 'The Ethics of Psychoanalysis' by Thomas Szasz. There are ethical issues in the treatment of schizophrenia. One issue is that lots of psychiatrists say it is an illness like diabetes, but they are wrong and are giving bad advice. There is no way to detect schizophrenia by finding a chemical structural abnormality in the body. A pathologist could never look at a corpse and conclude the person had schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is always diagnosed by looking at person's behaviour and complaints made about him by himself or by others. Schizophrenia is a label to legitimise coercing a person in the light of such complaints. Claiming schizophrenia is an illness is similar to counterfeiting: $URL$ This obscures moral and personal problems and so makes it more difficult to solve such problems. Another ethical problem with coercive treatment is that it amounts to imprisonment or forced drugging without trial. As such, coerced treatment is a grave threat to the rule of law. See "Law, Liberty and Psychiatry" by Thomas Szasz. 

There are real and serious problems with a lot of what commonly passes for philosophy among academics. I think philosophy is very important, but a lot of academic philosophy is not only unimportant but an impediment to solving real problems. Some philosophers started out with problems that arose from some scientific or political or moral problem. And some of those philosophers made some progress. Other philosophers then come along and comment on that philosopher without understanding the problems he was trying to solve. This sort of activity is almost always entirely useless. See "Conjectures and Refutations" by Karl Popper, Chapter 2 "The nature of philosophical problems and their roots in science" for an explanation of this point. Philosophers often reject criticism of their research agenda. Observe the deafening silence about Popper's criticism of the idea that justification is necessary and desirable, see Chapter I of "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Popper and "On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance" in "Conjectures and Refutations" by Popper. A lot of philosophy consists of analysing the meanings of words and that sort of thing. This was criticised by Popper in some of the material above, but also by Ernest Gellner in "Words and Things". Gellner wrote "Words and Things" in 1959, but its criticisms are still applicable to a lot of academic philosophy. Ayn Rand also criticised a lot of academic philosophy, see "Philosophy: who needs it". 

There are several problems with your question. The idea of the experience machine doesn't make sense. If you are being given some sensation the only thing that makes the sensation pleasant is your interpretation of it. And your interpretations will change as you create knowledge. So the machine would have to be able to predict the growth of knowledge to anticipate what you're going to want. But that's impossible. If you could know today what knowledge you will have tomorrow you would already have it. As the machine creates new knowledge about how to pleasure people people will respond to that by learning about how the machine has adjusted itself. Since the machine can't predict its own future knowledge, it can't predict the knowledge that people will develop in response and it can't give them pleasure. So the experience machine can't work. Is it wrong to force somebody to do something against his will that you imagine he would find pleasant or useful or whatever? Yes, for several reasons. (1) The refutation of the idea of the pleasure machine applies just as much to you as to some imaginary machine. You can't predict what somebody else will enjoy. (2) Whatever theory you have about what somebody will find pleasant the use of force makes testing it impossible. The only real test of whether somebody finds an activity worth doing is whether he does it when he is not forced to do it. If he is forced to do it he will do it regardless of whether he finds it worthwhile. So you are not only trying to do something impossible you are trying to do it while destroying your capacity to detect errors in what you're doing. (3) The idea that ignoring a person's objections to something you want him to do is making him experience reality is wrong. Since you have no interest in whether he understands and consents to what you are doing to him, you have no interest in whether he can interpret the experience properly and learn from it. So there is no fundamental difference between the case in which you force somebody to do something that you think should give pleasure and something that you think is "real". (I put inverted commas around the real because the experience in question is made up and controlled by you: it is a story you made up, not reality.) (4) Your fantasy about a brain disease that somehow reprograms a person to want to hurt himself is grossly immoral and dehumanising. A fault in the brain caused by some chemical or bacterium or structural fault is not going to make a person refuse some particular kind of experience. Such faults don't instantiate knowledge about what people want, any more than a fault in your television would make it display television shows you dislike. See the writings of Thomas Szasz, such as this essay. You ask: 

The best second hand accounts of Popper are in chapters 3 and 7 of David Deutsch's book "The Fabric of Reality" or Chapters 1, 2, 9, 10, 15,16 of "The Beginning of Infinity" by Deutsch. The vast bulk of second hand accounts of Popper are so bad as that it is difficult to believe they are supposed to be about the material they are supposedly commenting on. This includes almost all commentary by professional philosophers such as Lakatos and Feyerabend. Popper's best contribution was to epistemology. Part I, Chapter I of Popper's book "Realism and the aim of science" explains what is different about Popper's position, especially the first two sections. "On the sources of knowledge and of ignorance" the introduction to his book "conjectures and refutations" covers the same ground from a more historical perspective; chapters 2 and 3 of that book are also good on epistemology. Chapter 1 of Popper's book "Objective Knowledge" is a good account of his refutation and replacement of inductivism. The first two chapters of "The myth of the framework" are also very good. Popper's political philosophy is better than most political philosophy, but considering the competition that's not great praise. "The open society and its enemies" is long and has some problems but is okay. Chapters 4 and 18 of "conjectures and refutations" are very good on political philosophy. Many of the other chapters in that book are okay. 

Any finite physical system (such as a human brain) can be simulated by a universal computer operating by finite means: $URL$ So a person could be simulated on a computer if we understood the appropriate algorithm. In principle, it could be the case that the human brain could be simulated on a computer but is is impossible for anybody to understand the relevant algorithm and so impossible to set up the simulation. This seems implausible. It has to be the case that whatever algorithm our brain is running was created by rounds of variation and selection such that each stage it produced something useful. So there must be some sequence of problems we could solve that would lead to useful products at each stage and would produce AI at the end. Why would we be unable to do this? It can't just be a matter of memory or speed or reliability of computations since computers can do that for us. So I don't see what can stop us from creating AI. 

Let's take your idea seriously and see where it leads. You suggest that there is a being X that can understand stuff that it is inherently impossible for us to understand. So then there is some aspect of the world Y that is understood by X and can't be understood by us. First note that proposing X's ability to understand Y solves no problems that we can understand. If we can't understand Y then we can't understand whether or not X has solved that problem. So then we can have no reason to propose such an ability. Second the supposed existence of Y actually means that we don't understand anything. If Y exists it sometimes affects the stuff we supposedly understand and when it does so we can't understand the results. So then we don't really understand any of the stuff we understand now. Your specific candidates also don't stand up to serious scrutiny. The existence of God wouldn't solve any problems. Suppose that God is proposed as an explanation of Z. We have two options. (1) God made Z the case on whim in which case we might as well just say shit happens and be done with it. (2) Goid made Z the case for some reason, in which case we can just propose that reason as the explanation for Z. For example, if we say God made frogs to spread frog genes then we can just say that frogs evolved to spread frog genes. All of your other candidates are physical systems. The laws of physics as we currently understand them seem to imply the Turing Principle: any finite physical system can be simulated by a universal computer. Our brains are universal computers and so there is no reason to think that a person can't model any physical system with arbitrary accuracy. Doing the calculation yourself might be boring and you might farm that out to a dumber computer, like the one on your desktop and then just interpret the results. It also seems to be the case that the world can be understood piecemeal. For example, we can work out many of the circumstances under which water boils and qualitatively describe some phase transitions without understanding the physics of water molecules. We can then improve our understanding by inventing the theory that water consists of molecules in which two hydrogen atoms are linked to an oxygen atom and trying to work out the consequences of that idea. We can then understand more about different phases of water whose existence we didn't previously suspect: $URL$ You might want to read "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, which has a lot more material relevant to your question. 

Deduction is a useful way of working out the consequences of an idea in some contexts. This is useful for science since it allows you to do stuff like working out whether two theories are consistent with one another, or to work out the consequences of a theory so it can be experimentally tested. Induction is supposed to be a method that does the following. (1) It starts with experimental data or observations. (2) From those observations it somehow gets a theory. (3) Further observations somehow show the theory is true or probably true. Induction, as described above, is impossible. It is not a method that can be followed. As such, nobody has ever followed it. Nor will anyone ever follow it. The problems start with the first step. What are you supposed to observe and why? What experiments are you supposed to do and why? How are you supposed to construct an experiment without knowing what to look for? The second problem is that no number of observations is equivalent in any sense to a theory. It's not even equivalent to an explanation of a single event never mind an explanation of how the whole world works. Your experimental equipment records some events that happen during the experiment and not others. The unobserved events in general contribute to the outcome so that if you get them wrong you mess up the experiment. For example, you may observe the distribution of electrons reflected from an object in an electron microscope, but you don't observe the electrons while they are at the object you're trying to look at, nor while they are in flight. You guess that the electrons are not doing anything unintended and you learn about faults by seeing that the results look wrong if you do stuff wrong. The third step is also impossible for the same reason, and also because a theory refers to events that nobody could ever observe, e.g. - nobody was around 70 million years ago to observe an actual dinosaur. Karl Popper solved the problem of induction: that is, the problem that induction is impossible and so can't be a method used by scientists. Science actually works by noticing a problem with a current explanation, guessing solutions to that problem, criticising the solution until only one is left and it has no known criticisms and then moving on to a new problem. See "The Fabric of Reality" chapters 3 and 7 by David Deutsch, "The Beginning of Infinity" by Deutsch, Chapters 1 and 2 and "Realism and the Aim of Science" chapter I by Popper and "Objective Knowledge" Chapter 1 by Popper. So the distinction between induction and deduction is that deduction is sometimes useful and induction is nonsense. 

The conservation of information means something like "the entropy of the universe remains constant over time". this is entirely compatible with the entropy of all of the individual systems increasing over time because the joint system of two or more entangled systems can have a state of lower entropy than its subsystems. For example, the joint system of two qubits in the state |0>|0>+|1>|1> has zero von Neumann entropy, but the reduced state of each of the subsystems has maximal entropy. You can look up how to calculate the entropy and the reduced state in "Quantum Information and Quantum communication" by Nielsen and Chuang. Each of the subsystems in an entangled system has locally inaccessible information. The physical descriptors of each system depend on what you do to them, but their expectation value does not. For example, if you rotate a qubit its Heisenberg picture observables depend on the rotation, but their expectation value doesn't depend on the rotation. The only way to get this locally inaccessible information is to bring together all of the systems with which the qubit is entangled and do a suitable operation on them, see: $URL$ There is no particular problem with such dependence existing even if nobody knows about it. This is an implication of testable laws of physics even though that particular fact is not testable. You write:
