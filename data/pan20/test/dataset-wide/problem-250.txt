While it's hardly palatable, the Final Solution springs to mind. It has the advantage of being straightforward, since there is no doubt who is Red and who is Blue, unless there are some recessive genetic factors involved. And all the survivors will be happy - except maybe the ones who had to do the dirty work. There will be plenty of cheap land and houses available to award to them in appreciation of their vital work. All this is predicated on the assumption that there are no other countries involved who might give shelter to Blue refugees and thereby prolong the struggle. 

I'm going to buck the trend here, and suggest that, with a healer available within two minutes, death by gunshot is extremely rare. Shooting someone in the heart is almost instantly lethal in our world, but it's important to note that what happens does not involve instant tissue death. Rather, the cessation of blood flow to the brain causes loss of consciousness and then brain function. People have been brought back from cardiac arrest, but loss of oxygen for more than a few minutes does major brain damage. If a healer can both repair heart damage and restore function to the brain, I don't see any reason why most gunshots would be lethal. A lot depends on the nature of brain function, and whether the organized electrochemical patterns of a functioning brain can be restored once the cellular damage is fixed. On this issue a lot depends on what you think a healer can do. How well would a restored brain work? It seems pretty clear that autonomic nervous system function is hardwired, so restoring destroyed brain tissue would probably restore the ability to keep the heart and lungs going, along with all the other housekeeping functions. More problematic, though, are the higher functions. Our personality and all voluntary movement skills are learned responses, and the changes in brain chemistry/neuron connection which control these aspects would presumably be lost. So I'd expect major brain damage to produce the same sort of deficits that a survivable trauma do now. However, with the organic damage repaired, there would seem to be the possibility that recovery of some function would be possible, although the reduced plasticity in adults vs infants/children would tend to limit the possibility. 

This is, however, much less costly than a multilane highway. Here, for instance it is suggested that average interstate costs are ~100 million per mile for a 2-lane highway. Since separate direction roadways are required for safety, that's about 200 million per mile. This paper, on the other hand, suggests railway costs on the order of 3 to 4 million dollars per mile. Fuel costs are lower, as well. Peterbilt's latest gives a mileage of about 10 mpg for a total 65,000 pound vehicle. Assuming about 15,000 pounds for the vehicle and trailer, that's about 10 mpg for a 25-ton load, or about 250 ton-miles per gallon, and this is touted as being twice the average efficiency for the industry as a whole, so current numbers are more like 125 ton-miles per gallon. Meanwhile, the rail industry typically claims something like 400+ ton-miles per gallon and the railway industry claims 4 times better energy efficiency than trucks. 

I'm not at all certain what you mean by "holiness", or how you would quantify it, but the most obvious action is to suppress the production of sex hormones, particularly testosterone. This will have two effects. First, it will cut down the birth rate enormously, and we need that to avoid winding up standing cheek to cheek over the entire globe as we starve. Second, it will be make everybody much less aggressive, and I assume you associate that with being holy. 

Done. It's called the Interstate Highway System. Particularly for relatively short runs the flexibility does give highways the edge, and the effect has been well-known since the 50s. Railways are mostly dominant for long-range shipping or extremely bulky goods. Coal is an example where trucks simply don't compete economically. 

This is really very simple. There exists an animal vector in which the zombie virus is not terribly damaging. The term for interspecies diseases is zoonotic. The classic example is the Ebola virus, which apparently has such a host, although as far as I know nobody's found it. Avian flu is another example, and likewise, swine flu. And, of course, the phenomenon can be beneficial, as in the case of cowpox, which confers immunity to smallpox in humans. If, in addition, transfer from animal to human is unlikely (but not impossible), the virus can persist in the animal population, only occasionally crossing over to the human population and wreaking havoc. 

With a fabulous magical gold energy technology, and gold hard to extract, It's clear that a gold engine would have to be fantastically efficient, and that is bad news for gold. Start by comparing your gold engine to a gasoline IC engine. Yeah, yeah, diesel is more economical, but not that much more. Gasoline has an energy content of about 46 MJ/kg. Assuming that a gas engine has a thermodynamic efficiency of 30%, that's an effective energy content of 13.8 MJ/kg, or 37.6 MJ/US gal (you can tell I'm American, right?) With current automobile gas efficiencies in the neighborhood of 1 gal/hr, assuming 30 mpg at 30 mph, that suggests a nominal automobile power of 10,444 J/sec, or about an average of 14 hp, which is not clearly wrong by an order of magnitude. At 2 dollars/gallon, this gives an energy price for gasoline of about (roughly) 5 cents per MJ. With gold prices currently at about 1200/oz (troy), it would take about 50 mg of gold to buy a gallon of gasoline. In 2014, world production of oil was 86.8 million bpd, or 31.7 trillion barrels. A petroleum barrel contains 31.5 gallons, so world production was (assuming all petroleum is gasoline) of about 1 quadrillion gallons. At current gold prices, that's about 50 trillion grams, or 50 billion kg. or 50 million tonnes. Since estimates of total global stocks of gold run as high as 2.5 million tonnes, or 2.5 million kg, two weeks global gasoline usage provided by gold (at current prices)would exhaust the world's gold stocks. So clearly, the price of gold would have to be much higher. How much higher? Well, if it were 20 times higher it would take a year to use up the world's gold, so let's add another factor of 1000. After all, if it were 100 times more, the world's economy would be looking at the end of the gold engine's usefulness in the forseeable future. Increasing gold prices by a factor of 20,000 pushes current prices to about 2.5 million dollars per ounce, and that is a real problem for using gold as a reserve. The problem here is that gold is now too valuable. After all, with this factor applied to current reserve amounts, the total world monetary gold reserves, between central banks and private reserves a total of about 60,000 tonnes, would amount to 3 tonnes, which is just silly. Another way to look at this is to equate the world petroleum production with gold production, which is about 1.5 million kg. The ratio works out to about 666,000 gallons/g of gold. At 2 dollars/gallon, that's 1.3 million dollars per gram. This presumes, essentially, that you can run a car for an hour using 1.5 micrograms of gold. To claim that the increased demand for gold would increase production is almost certainly true, but it's not at all clear what the resulting production would be. For instance, the total gold dissolved in the world's oceans is only on the order of 20 million tonnes, or less than a decade's requirement. The takeout of all this, I think, is that any widespread gold engine technology which outcompetes petroleum to the point of replacing it would have the effect of long-since depleting the world gold supply to nothing, or eliminating gold as a workable currency basis. Same long-term effect, really. 

And any competent government is going to (effectively) nationalize those enterprises. This will allow emergency diversion of resources to facilitate vaccine production. If the enterprises don't want to go along, that's just too bad and they can sue the government when the crisis is over. I suggest you read up, for instance, on the actions taken during the Spanish Flu, to get an idea of just how much an epidemic can do to the normal limits to government behavior. 

This idea will only work so far. Since the world is without land, there are no land masses to interrupt the development of storms, and they have an essentially unlimited length of wave development (called fetch). As a result, storm-driven waves will become enormous. When these waves encounter your "trees", unless the organism can flex freely it will break. This is similar to the maximum (about 300 feet or so) length of wooden ships. Beyond that length, wooden ships tend to break. And, since seasoned wood is stronger than green wood, you should assume that your "trees" are weaker than a wooden ship would be. So in order to survive, the "trees" must consist of smallish solid parts interconnected by very strong, flexible tendrils, and there must be some built-in mechanism to prevent the solid parts from fusing.
