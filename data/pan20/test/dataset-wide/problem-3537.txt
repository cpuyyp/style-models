I am a 21 years old male around 180 cm and 72 kg. I often do cardio exercise but I've never done any kind of strength related exercise. I want to start doing some and I was considering Freeletics as a starting point. What attracted me about it was the possibility of doing the exercises almost anywhere (because not much space is needed) and not needing any additional equipment. But I tried some of the workouts and, while I felt perfectly capable of doing some of them, there were others that I think that are too hard for me at this time. I don't know if it would be good for me if I keep doing those workouts that I'm capable of completing right know and trying those that I can't once in a while or if it would be better to do something else. So, would Freeletics make an impact on me as a begginer or should I seek something easier at first? EDIT: The main problem for completing the workouts is that some of them are too "long" for me and I don't have the required endurance to complete them (Dione would be a good example of this, 3 rounds, 75 jumping jacks, 25 burpees, 50 straight leg lever,75 jumping jacks, 50 situps, 25 burpees each one of them) and for individual exercises the problem usually is a lack of strenght (I can't do a proper pullup) 

I have a proposed mechanism from personal experience. Although there is insufficient evidence, I hope that the information will be an anectdote to the above statments that more or less imply that there may be no negative side effects of riding with these shoes. Please comment if you have had any similar experiences. Riding and racing bicycles was my primary extracurricular activity for many years - all done with cycling shoes. Now I ride my bike for commuting - with the same look style cleats and often with heavy loads of children and a single gear. I have taken up running for my primary activity. After developing plantar fascitis last summer, and then feeling the way my foot naturally attempts to grab the pedal by curling up, I am beginning to suspect that this could cause some of the issues with my plantar tendon. I am generally very cautious about and attentive to errors that may be leading to pain. So, I am planning to get either flatter pedals or using cycling shoes. 

It seems a lot of form problems with the squats are caused by inadequate flexibility - I think mainly in the hamstrings and also the shoulders. What are some good stretches that can be used to enhance the squat form? 

If you are going over technique with a coach the sooner you try out what you have learnt, the more information will stick in your mind. So I would stick with the Friday work out. Don't try to get any personal bests with your weights - but still move up so it feels fairly heavy and focus on the technique you've learnt. Overtraining is something that occurs over a period of time. One day isn't going to wipe you out. 

I often have a very high heart rate when doing cardiovascular exercise even if I try to keep low intensity when doing it. I mostly run or swim and I would like to be able to keep a lower heart rate while doing exercise. Also, sometimes I feel a bit dizzy if I stop suddenly the exercise without decreasing the intensity bit by bit. Furthermore, my heart rate doesn't decrease very fast when I finish the exercise. It is decreasing slowly over time when I keep doing exercise in a regular basis but I would like to know if there are any tips to keep my heart rate lower when doing exercise and to get back to a normal heart rate afterwards 

There are plenty of body weight exercises that could keep you going. If you find pushups too easy (ie. you can do more than 5 easily) make it harder by doing inclined pushups, or try one armed pushups. If squats are too hard - can you do one-legged squats (pistols)? A good book to work through during the week would be The Naked Warrior. Pavel goes in intricate detail about mastering the one armed pushup and the pistol. What you learn from going through this book will be useful for your Starting Strength program. Also, pullups and chinups will give you a good upper body workout - if they are too easy, try them one-handed. 

Since having children, I have taken up running because I can push them along. Sometimes I push one kid in a running stroller, other times I push two kids in a small-wheeled stroller that offers much more resistance. I have been reading and developing the ChiRunning technique, which provides fairly detailed instructions about movement. How can I adapt my running technique (ChiRunning specifically, or running technique in general) to accommodate pushing a stroller? Some specific problems / questions that I am 'running' into: 

I like myfitnesspal.com It is primarily a calorie tracker, but it also keeps a log of nutrition, exercise, and weight. It is free and has iphone/android/blackberry apps. The food calorie calculations use an excellent database of foods and an adequate database of exercises. The foods have most groceries, popular restaurants, and recipes from popular cookbooks and websites. You can also add your own recipes. The exercises are used to calculate calories burned. This is based on your exercise and your body weight. The database is fairly complete, but there are some limitations and a lot of assumptions that do not always seem to provide accurate estimates, but this may be inherent to any calculation of calories burned (I have no way of checking their estimates). There are excellent social networking capabilities. - you can tweet, post on facebook, or build a community within the site. I haven't used these though. You can download your food and exercise logs. And there are some rudimentary data summaries provided by the site. 

Here is a list of sports and the average calories lost whilst taking part in them. Running, skiing, diving and cycling seem to lost the highest calories. However the best sport is probably one that you will do. The more you enjoy it, the more likely you will keep at it. Which ones do you enjoy the most? 

I have recently started doing the overhead press as per Starting Strength. I am getting a pain when I get close to the full extension of the press. It feels like a tendon pain as it is in a very small area at the top of the shoulder joint. The pain only occurs if I press more than about 30kg or so. What could be causing that pain? Or if its not that easy to tell over the internet what is causing the pain, what steps should I go through to try to locate and fix the cause?
