Put $R_n=\mathbb{R}[t_0,\dotsc,t_n]/(\sum_it_i-1)$ (the ring of polynomial functions on the $n$-simplex). Consider a monomial $t^a=t_0^{a_0}\dotsb t_n^{a_n}$. Let $(b_0,\dotsc,b_n)$ be the sequence $(a_0,\dotsc,a_n)$ arranged in nondecreasing order. I'll say that $t^a$ is admissible if $b_n=b_{n-1}+1$. One can show that the admissible monomials form a basis for $R_n$ with various convenient properties. In the case $n=1$, you just get the monomials $t_0^{i+1}t_1^i$ and $t_0^it_1^{i+1}$, for example (so $1$ has to be expressed as $t_0+t_1$). Does this appear in the literature, and if so, under what name? 

The space $S^\infty$ is actually homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^\infty$. To see this, put \begin{align*} B_n &= \{x\in\mathbb{R}^\infty\::\: \|x\|\leq n, x_k = 0\text{ for } k \geq n\} \\ C_n &= \{x\in S^\infty\::\: x_n \leq 1/2,\; , x_k = 0\text{ for } k > n\}. \end{align*} Then $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is the colimit of the spaces $B_n$, and $S^\infty$ is the colimit of the spaces $C_n$. Moreover, $B_n$ and $C_n$ are both homeomorphic to the $n$-ball, and they are contained in the interiors of $B_{n+1}$ and $C_{n+1}$ respectively. One can cook up compatible homeomorphisms $f_n\:B_n\to C_n$, and pass to the colimit to obtain a homeomorphism $\mathbb{R}^\infty\to S^\infty$. One can prove along similar lines that various other standard contractible spaces are also homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, for example $\mathbb{R}^\infty\setminus A$ (for any finite subset $A$), or $F(\mathbb{R}^\infty\setminus A,n)$, or the Stiefel manifold $V_n(\mathbb{R}^\infty)$. However, the linear isometry space $L(\mathbb{R}^\infty,\mathbb{R}^\infty)$ is homeomorphic to $\prod_{i=0}^\infty\mathbb{R}^\infty$, which is different. 

Another kind of answer is Atiyah duality: if we write $D(X)$ for the Spanier-Whitehead dual of $X$ then $D(M/\partial M)$ is the Thom spectrum $M^{-TM}$. For any finite spectrum $X$ we have $H_k(DX)=H^{-k}(X)$ and $H^k(DX)=H_{-k}(X)$. For any finite complex $X$ and any orientable virtual vector bundle $V$ of virtual dimension $d$ we also have $H^k(X^V)=H^{k-d}(X)$ and $H_k(X^V)=H_{k-d}(X)$. If $M$ is an orientable manifold of dimension $n$ this gives $H^{k-n}(M^{-TM})=H^k(M)$. By combining these facts we can recover Poincar√© duality from Atiyah duality. 

This is getting too long for a comment, so I will make it an answer. First note that in the third relation for $A$, the term $xy^2$ is zero by the second relation. So we have $$ A = \mathbb{C}[[x,y,u]]/(xy+x^3,y^2,x^5). $$ Next note that in $B$ we have $x^5=-xy^2=ux^5$ so $(1-u)x^5=0$ but $1-u$ is invertible so $x^5=0$. Using this we get $$ B = \mathbb{C}[[x,y,u]]/(xy+x^3,y^2+ux^4,x^5). $$ It follows that both $A$ and $B$ have plenty of nilpotents, and $A/\sqrt{0}=B/\sqrt{0}=\mathbb{C}[[u]]$. 

Things are easier if you do not want $\otimes$ to be symmetric, but I think that the coherence conditions are still fairly complex. 

Planar stuff is not too hard. I generally use the LaTeX package tikz, because that way everything is in the LaTeX file. Three-dimensional pictures are harder. If you know equations for your surfaces then you can plot them using Maple or Mathematica and then export as jpeg say, and then include in your LaTeX file using the graphicx package and the \includegraphics command. However, it is surprisingly hard to find good equations for the kind of two-holed doughnuts or pairs of pants that people typically draw. I have done a few pictures like this using Blender (www.blender.org) but it was hard work and I wasn't totally happy with the result. Of course it is also possible to draw pictures by hand and scan them. 

You might like to look at the paper "Algebraic theories, span diagrams and commutative monoids in homotopy theory" ($URL$ by James Cranch. I think that it does not directly answer any of your questions, but it involves the same circle of ideas. 

For finite-type torsion spectra $X$ there is a natural isomorphism $$ KU_{n-1}(X) \simeq \text{Hom}_c(KU^n(X),\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}). $$ Here $\text{Hom}_c$ denotes the group of homomorphisms that are continuous with respect to the skeletal topology on $KU^*(X)$ and the discrete topology on $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. The isomorphism can be obtained in a fairly straightforward way using $X\wedge S\mathbb{Q}=0$ (so $X=\Sigma^{-1}X\wedge S(\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$) and standard exactness arguments. If $G$ is a finite group then we can take $X$ to be $\Sigma^\infty BG$ (without disjoint basepoint) to get reduced $K$-homology groups $KU_{2n}(BG)=0$ and $$ KU_{2n-1}(BG) = \text{Hom}_c(\widehat{J}(G),\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}). $$ Here $J(G)$ is the augmentation ideal in the representation ring, and $\widehat{J}(G)$ is the completion of $J(G)$ with respect to itself. If $G$ is a $p$-group then we just have $\widehat{J}(G)=J(G)\otimes\mathbb{Z}_p$. The above answer is of course the same as you get via local cohomology, but this argument is more elementary. 

I'll define a naive prespectrum to be a system of spaces $X_i$ with maps $\Sigma X_i\to X_{i+1}$. That seems to be what you want to work with, but it is not technically very satisfactory. However, if $\mathcal{C}$ is one of the fancier categories of spectra, then one can define $FX$ to be the homotopy colimit in $\mathcal{C}$ of the objects $\Sigma^{-i}\Sigma^\infty X_i$, and that will give an object of $\mathcal{C}$ that has the homotopy type that you want. From this perspective, the real point is that $FX \wedge FY$ is the homotopy colimit of the diagram of objects $\Sigma^{-i-j}\Sigma^\infty X_i\wedge Y_j$, and that colimit can be broken down in three different ways: 

Here are some initial thoughts. Put $$ X(R)=\{e\in R: e^2=e \text{ and } er=re \text{ for all } r\in R\} $$ We can partially order this by declaring that $e\leq f$ iff $ef=e$. We then put $$ Y(R)=\{e\in X(R): 0\lt e \text{ and there is no } f\in X(R) \text{ with } 0 \lt f \lt e \} $$ One can check that $X(R)$ is a finite Boolean algebra under this order (with meet operation $e\wedge f=ef$ and join $e\vee f=e+f-ef$) so it is isomorphic to the lattice of subsets of its set of atoms, which is $Y(R)$. In particular, if $|Y(R)|=n$ then $|X(R)|=2^n$. For $e\in Y(R)$ we put $$ R[e] = Re = \{ x\in R : ex=xe=x\} $$ We can then define $p:R\to\prod_{e\in Y(R)}R[e]$ by $p(x)_e=ex$. It is standard that this is an isomorphism of rings. Next, by hypothesis we have a bijection $f:R\to S$ that preserves multiplication. It follows that $f$ gives an isomorphism $X(R)\to X(S)$ of posets, and thus a bijection $Y(R)\to Y(S)$. As the sets $R[e]$ and the maps $p_e$ are defined using only the multiplicative structure, we see that $f$ gives an isomorphism $R[e]\to S[f(e)]$ of multiplicative monoids for each $e\in Y(R)$. However, we do not obviously have an additive isomorphism from $R[e]$ to $S[f(e)]$, so this does not succeed in reducing the problem to the indecomposable case. Nonetheless, it is worth thinking about the ring structure of $R[e]$. The quotient by the Jacobson radical is a finite simple ring and so is a matrix algebra over a finite division ring, but finite division rings are fields by a theorem of Wedderburn, so this quotient is quite tractable.
