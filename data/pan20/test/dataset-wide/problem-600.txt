Yes you should clean the chain occasionally. Where does the dirt go if you don't clean it off ? True that dry lubricants are not as sticky as wet ones, but there's still dirt there and it needs to come off, not get further into your chain's gubbins. 

The quickest way to ruin a bike is to leave it outside in all weathers. Answer: Park it inside, or in a garage. If you don't have anything like that, at least park it under cover out of the weather. 

Sounds like fun - I'd start by riding on quiet roads, and I'd fit studded tyres to all four wheels. You can swap back to non-studded come summer. Look if your ebike function has a limiter function. You don't want full power else wheel slip. My trailer always gets a skunk stripe on the front, from the rooster tail of the rear wheel. BUT its got a "full" mudguard. If you want to avoid throwing mud and roadwater at your kid's faces, look for a rear mudguard that goes a long way around the wheel, and hang a leather dangler/mudflap on the end. These are more often used on the front wheel, but when towing will keep the trailer cleaner. Comms - I have a bunch of handheld radios, and use them for all sorts of weird things (eg dog training) It would be hard to talk to the load when riding, so you could hook a radio inside for them and one on your collar. The inside one may work with Vox mode (transmit on voice) so you can hear their chatter :) Most important will be braking - your method may need to change, and if that's not enough you may need to fit your trailer with a brake. 

My last 26" tube cost $8 NZ, so not a lot. Depends how much time you want to invest, and how much patches cost. Poor abrading/sanding/scouring ot the area before applying the rubber cement will leave an area of bad adhesion, and the pressurised air can find its way out. I bet you were in a hurry and didn't give the cement 10 minutes to cure before fitting the patch? If your leak is because the patch straddles a ridge then you might be able to shove some rubber cement down there, and then spend a couple minutes pressuring the patch on. Problem is that the patch becomes chemically welded to the rubber tyre/tire. You cannot remove the patch and do it over. Your best bet would be to abraid the tyre surface, then push cement into the leak and around the area, WAIT 10 MINUTES, then fit another patch and press it down firmly with a spoon edge or a roller, or a large round coin. If that fails, fit a new tube. For the cost, its not worth fitting $10 of patches to fix a $10 tube. 

Once your design is finished, contact a metalworking company to price it. They may make suggestions. 

Final thought - if you don't want a rigid shaft, consider cannibalising a freewheel or freehub. I'd consider slapping a whole freewheel cassette on, and using an appropriate gear. This way the machinery can move forward on the freewheel but not backward. Clamp it up between two cone nuts on the threadded shaft. 

I remember a good answer on this site about modern MTB geometry, where the headset looks way too far forward, but can't find it. For your needs, I suspect a very short stem combined with extending the top and down tubes will be about all you can do. Trying to change the angle of the forks by extreme amounts will be fairly fruitless. Idea: How about indirect steering? Imagine sitting in the rear seat of a tandem and steering from the back? There are some great images of an old rear-steer tandem which may give you enough ideas for your own build. It'll still steer like a boat, but it should track okay and self-center like a normal bike. 

Personally I'd wire-brush the worst of the rust off with a brass bristle brush. Then I'd apply some rustblaster converter to make the red iron oxide into stable black iron oxide. Leave to set for a day. For handlebars and stems I then sand the item, apply a light spray coat of one-coat primer/topcoat matt spraypaint. That is left to dry for a day, or if I'm in a hurry I wait an hour or two and then hit it with a hot air gun and then another hour to cool down. Then another light sand, and a top coat of either gloss, semigloss, or matt spraypaint to match the bike's look. Shiny looks nice, but some things suit the dull look. Again another period of drying and hot air. I do not generally clear-coat bike parts. For your nut, I'd probably stop after the rust converter. 

IMO it is not over-tightened spokes. I've had something similar, where a rim started cracking radially away from the hole. Adjacent spoke holes showed similar but less damage. My guess is that it was from a large impact with a road fixture, where the afflicted spoke was at the top of the wheel opposite the impact, so when my weight hit the saddle and the rim was forced up and back by the edge of the surprise-kerb. So ask the rider if they've hit any big potholes or other hard impacts, and check the opposite side of the rim for dings or dimples. The tyre probably won't show any damage. That rim is shot and needs replacement. It is not safe to ride. You could buy a new rim and reuse the hub/spokes. It is always good to build a wheel at least once in your life. Then get it final-trued by a LBS. 

In my city we had some significantly large earthquakes 6 years ago. Since then, many of the roads have been sub-standard. Any cyclist signalling has to take one hand off the bars, and risks hitting pothole or gravel and having correspondingly less control. So unless there's another road user waiting in a situation where signalling would be good manners, then I just won't bother. Pedal signalling still works, but its not listed in the local road rules so only cyclists and motorcyclists would possibly understand. 

Looks like a 70s/80s single-speed bike, or possibly a 3 speed rear internally geared hub at best. Will be a steel frame and forks. Those brake calipers look somewhat flimsy, and the plastic saddle is definitely non-original, possibly from a BMX or kids bike. The cottered cranks are a really old design, which were common in the 60s and perhaps the 70s. Its also possible it was a derailleur bike in the past but has had parts changed. Unless you know its history, it only has value as a daily ride or scrap metal 

Something like this might be better. Ball joints tend to fail when subject to vibration, and more so when on the end of an arm/pole. These things rotate 360 degrees and work fairly well. Personally I'd use a wrist strap around the handlebars as well, as a secondary fastening. 

I'm your height, and have long legs too. Personally I have bent several seatposts and have cracked one frame because the seat was up too high. The only thing you can do is buy a longer seatpost and fit it, but this increases leverage on the post and frame. More modern bikes use larger seatposts so have a little more material to cope with more force. The seatpost can be reinforced using a second smaller pole up the inside of the seatpost. Downsides are extra weight, and its high-up. There is no good way to reinforce a frame. 

To focus on Question 1 - the reason the stem tube is "slanted" is that the wedge is pulled up firmly inside the fork's steerer tube and makes a good tight connection. There should be no/minimal insert friction when adding/removing the quill stem. The wedge gets pulled up but forced forwards to the inside wall of the tube. YES its a bad thing that the slope is broken off 

One of the reasons for standing on steep bits is weighting of the front wheel. Many riders have choppy pedalling technique (I know I do) and lower cadence exacerbates the pulsing of power. On a local steep climb of 17% I have to stand and lean forward , or else each pedal push raises the front wheel off the ground leading to an instant of no steering and poor balancing. It also feels like you could be about to flip-over backwards, which is an unpleasant sensation. Techniques to help: 

Basically its the gap between the tyre and any non-wheel part of the bike frame. Static clearance is almost exactly the same as the clearances you have while riding, as long as the wheel axle bearings aren't sloppy and the wheel doesn't move laterally. 

Remove the inner wire - it gets in the way during disassembly. If its at all rusty or hard to pull through, then dispose and fit a fresh one. They're cheap. Leave all the outer housings in place unless they need replacing too. Remove brake/shifter from handlebars - this probably means removing the grip and anything else in the way. Clear your workspace - don't want to loose any parts. Remove FOUR screws - two screws from underneath, one shouldered screw from on-top by the brake adjuster, and the brake reach screw. Also remove the inner cable adjuster by unthreadding it, but don't lose the loose spring. Put aside. Using a spudger or a flat screwdriver, separate the top cover near the brake wire adjuster. It should rotate up around the 7 segment gear display and look like this one apart. Note this shows an inner wire in place - I've used a short piece as a demonstrator. The clear plastic 7 slot display is on the main body in this photo. It should slide out easily, and fit it to the cover instead. Next lift off the small white nylon lever from the center of the main shaft. Put aside. 

Its a Shimano Tourney mech and the cage seems to be a mid-length one. The mount point seems to NOT have a separate hanger, so you do need something with a "Direct Mount" which is the bolt at the top, like this: <-- Yes and NOT a frame mount that goes under the axle nut like this one: <-- Nope Start here $URL$ 

I think you're approaching this the wrong way. Come up with a design on paper that fits your requirements, then find a local fabrication company to weld up what you want. Features you could consider 

In theory if there were 90 clicks, and everything else was the same, power would be transmitted to wheel from chain in 2 degrees on average, or a worst case of 4 degrees. 

There's an implication at the end that body-mounted lights are bad, but whether that's law or a suggestion is not stated. There's no stated restriction on colour. The only mention of flashing relates to the rear light which is permitted. $URL$ says 

This style is great, but reasonably pricey. It induces a setback when still and a little more when compressed. Photo is a Cane Creek Thudbuster, but there are many others. 

Basically it is badly adjusted, damaging things until it fails outright in some manner. That may happen today, or it might grind on for a decade. munching at the ball bearings and the cups and cones. 

Does it click if you spin the wheel backward by hand? This is hard to test while riding, but you could pull the wheel and install it flipped. Be careful while riding in this state. Can you find another wheel - borrow one off another bike or another person. Just confirm that a different wheel doesn't click. Confirmation is handy. While the wheel is off, clean and examine the front dropouts and fork legs for damage, chips or cracks, Its pretty unlikely but the wheel is off anyway. Next would be to open the wheel hub and remove the bearings. If they're sealed cartridge bearings then play with them and see if you can feel a click at any point. If they're loose balls in a cup/cone then clean out all the grease with a solvent and look hard at the race's track under a strong light. Anything that looks bad, is bad. Specifically spalling (where bits break off the running surface) smearing (where the bearings are dragging around not rolling) or galling means replacement time. 

I have a crook shoulder so can't put a lot of weight on it. But our office bike room is on the first floor (second floor) and there's a stairwell to get up there. So I stand on the left, non drive-side where its cleaner, put my arm over the top tube and grasp the seat tube between the bottom bracket and the seat tube drink cage. On standing, the nose of the saddle ends up above my right shoulder and the seat post presses against the back of my shoulder. I use my left hand on the left handlebar drop, so its easy to pivot the wheel for going around corners in the stairwell. Also the bike is well balanced, so there's not a lot of front/back heaviness. I used to do this with the 30 kg ebike too, so weight isn't a big issue. Road cleats on tiles are slippy, so I always de-shoe and carry them in the left hand. Everything goes in one trip unless I've brought the trailer as well - that's a second trip. Do you want photos ? 

To make best use of your gears, you want to ride at a pedal cadence of ~80 RPM. So pick a gear that lets you spin the pedals at about this speed. Too slow and it hurts your knees. Many riders live in the middle ring and use the rear mech to get gears, only changing front ring in the extreme of headwind/uphill or downhill/tailwind. Personally I live in the big ring all the time, until it gets steep. Changing gears will also help spread your overall wear, and lets you get moving quicker from a stop at the red light. 

This shows my first efforts were above 45 minutes and approached an hour. My best effort so far is under 24 minutes. I find this to be a good motivator. The downside of strava is that it defaults to showing you everyone's efforts, and it can be disheartening to see your effort as #997 of 1000 attempts. So the trick is to change the options to display "my efforts first" or similar. 

If you are handy, buy the tools and be set for life. Otherwise get the LBS to do it. A mid-range shimano one cost me $50 NZ and has been one of the best upgrades to my old bike. BTW you ride a bike thats older than me - that's impressive. Thank you for not contributing to the throw-away society. 

However this will drastically reduce your tyre life, and one slip with a grinder will leave you needing a new tyre anyway. Plus it makes a huge mess. Also, the rubber inside the tyre is softer than the rubber on the surface, so it will wear quicker. 

The risk in not doing this is that there will be damage done to the cones in your BB, and if metal flakes off the inside surfaces where the bearings run, then its toast and you will need a replacement. A cartridge bearing is relatively cheap these days, and is well worth doing even on a beater bike. 

Your phone is $URL$ which makes no mention of ant+ support. However that site also doesn't state my phone has ant+ $URL$ If you can find your phone's chipset on $URL$ it will confirm whether the hardware can support ANT+ $URL$ shows the strava app is ANT+ aware on android. For completeness, iphones don't have ANT, they only might have Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) but they can use a WAHOO RFLCKT to mirror/bridge ANT+ signals to BLE. Windows phones don't even have a strava app. As for HRMs, I bought one of these $URL$ for $24 USD. Its worked fine for ~4 months now. 

They grow so fast it really doesn't matter, but if the kid looks too low then they are, so go up a bit. Rider should be able to stand over the seat with both feet on the ground. While some balance bikes have bike seats with clamps like this, they're in the minority for cost and weight reasons.
