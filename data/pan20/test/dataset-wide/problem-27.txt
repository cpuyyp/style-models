If the four diagonal beams are held in a 45° position by the support rope and each other, there will be no bending forces on the structure whatsoever, and the anchoring will be next to trivial. 

Scientific background: Tiny errors in reassembly would be indistinguishable from the errors introduced by an X-rays or radioactive radiation: Almost the entire body is entirely unaffected, but at some points, an atom is missing from a place where it should be, and instead running loose somewhere else. So, the cumulative long term effects would be the same as those of excessive exposition to X-rays or radioactive radiation: Increased risk of cancer. Also, heavy teleporting in a very short time would cause radiation sickness. This would, of course, only kick in if you teleported like every five minutes for a whole day. Another effect of this is, that teleportation of electronic devices would also be affected: Any stored data may be corrupted by some bits getting flipped due to the reconstruction errors. This includes permanently stored data as well as data in working memory. 

This let me assume, that they still know that their changes had been rejected. This might be a new possible source for the "I wish it were me" problems, of the sort "I whish my changes/experiences would be kept": Every clone might want to make changes that will end in the merged personality. This can lead both to try to figure out how BOSS decides which change would override and adopt their behavior to this. If they e.g. experience that exciting situations are less changed to fit with the others they might start to life a riskier life than they would without BOSS. Edit: I had been asked to put an example for "conflicting changes". They depend a bit on how the problem of brains is actual mapped to the version control system. The question mentioned a post which says: 

Possible story related effects: The consequence would be, that teleportation would need to be strictly rate limited to allow the body to regenerate from the damages, and to keep the cancer rate down to a tolerable level. "What, you want to go too? Sorry, you've already teleported ... times this year, I can't allow that!" No matter how well such rate limiting is enforced, it would not suffice to keep bad teleportation machines from generating too many reconstruction errors. This would easily go unnoticed, if it is not regularly controlled for. The effect would be like excessive radiation exposure, of course. Such bad machines could lead to inexplicable increases of cancer incidences among groups of people regularly using the bad machines. This would lend itself to the-corrupt-powers-that-be-hush-it-all-up story lines. It's also not unlikely that professional teleportation users would be required to wear dosimeters when teleporting as staff in nuclear plants needs to do. As I said, the "radiation" from teleportation would also affect electronic devices, especially storage devices: "Sorry, the data on your USB stick seems to be corrupt... How often did you teleport with it?" The fun part is, that active devices like laptops and cell phones could experience any kind of software error. Of course, the most likely results would either be a crash immediately after teleportation or silent data corruption on their hard drives. However, any software misbehavior could be explained that way. For example: 

Firstly you would have to teach humans to stop breathing. Breathing is considered an irrepressible reflex. From that standpoint there is no sense to engineer such a suit. Futhermore, if you were able to construct a technology that can oxygenate blood as effectively as the lung and fit it into a suit, which requires access to the bloodstream, you are quite reasonably able to create a device that oxygenates air. That device can still be integrated into the helmet without an air hose, or if you want small enough to be put into your mouth. For the part about the survivable surroundings just look at them individually and see what kills humans (and in what order). Usually pressure, radiation and temperature come first. EDIT: I wanted to point out that the process of breathing is immaterial to the question. What if? Digging Downward 

Pro steel: The material strength of titanium is less than that of steel. This means that it would be the titanium sword that gets the dent when it clashes with a steel sword. After a fight, the elves would need to remake the edges of their titanium swords. Pro titanium: The lower weight of the material would allow for greater length of the swords than steel, allowing the elvish fighters to score hits before their opponents can even reach them. Pro titanium: The lower material weight would also allow the swords to be thicker than their steel counterparts, actually allowing the titanium swords to be stronger against breakage than their steel counterparts. So, while it would be the titanium swords that gets the dent, it would be the steel sword that breaks. Which one do you prefer? 

I agree with the answers of AlexP and evilscary, but want to add that we are likely to see some chaos in the orbit like we do with the small moons of Pluto. I want to recommend, that you study this system as a possible example. I consider the small moons of Pluto to be a good example for another possible orbit of the two sun system because: 

Charon and Pluto do orbit around a common barycenter, which lays outside of both. The other moons (Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra) are way smaller (which means less gravity) and can bee seen as orbiting the barycenter of pluto and charon. There are some resources about it (see [1], [2] and [3] as a start).

How to explain gigantic subs: Well, you obviously need a reason for large subs. As a matter of fact, subs are relatively poor at actually controlling an area (or water volume). To do this, it might be necessary to use a large fleet of small subs. However, small subs cannot use nuclear reactors, as those have a certain minimal size. So, the small sub fleet would have to do with battery power. But how can you reload your batteries when you are on the other side of the planet, and want to avoid surfacing for whatever reasons? Enter the big sub carrying sub! It would work a bit like aircraft carries today: You have one really big vessel, which contains at least a dozen small vessels, which are the big vessel's eyes and arms. These small vessels patrol the area that is to be controlled, and they strike against any enemy they find within their action radius. Once their batteries are down, they return to their carrier for a battery charge, remunitioning, and some fresh supplies. The carrier sub itself would be huge by todays standards. It would likely contain several powerful nuclear reactors, large ammunition storage areas, and have several places for the small subs to dock. The parts that need to be at atmospheric pressure would all be contained within a number of long cylinders, each no more than five meters in diameter for structural efficiency. This pack-of-thin-cylinders design would go quite well with its purpose of being a carrier of many small subs, I think. The big sub itself would not have much defensive capabilities itself, relying on its fleet of small subs to defend it, just like aircraft carriers rely on their air force to defend them. The big carrier sub might contain a few big offensive missile type weapons, though; weapons larger than the small subs can carry. Such a carrier sub would really be able to control a certain volume of the sea, which is hard to do with the modern subs which are mostly built for offensive strikes on the surface. The modern subs are built that way, because we humans are most interested in controlling the earths surface, for obvious reasons. A civilization that mostly lives underwater would have much different priorities: They would desire to control either water volume, or areas on the bottom of the oceans, so I think, big carrier subs would suit them well. 

Depending on the specs of your suit humans can survive everything. If they "dress up warm/cool/reflective as appropriate", at least if we assume appropriate means according to the surroundings. It's a circular question, if it's too cold, hot, radioactive or the pressure is too high, the appropriate dressing up lands in a pressurized full body suit very quickly. Reaching that point there is really no point in using an external machine to do the lungs do perfectly. Oxygenating the air in a suit of whatever model is just simpler than going directly to the blood. Unless you have a process that doesn't need input oxygen. There seems to be no reason for anyone technically advanced enough to externally oxygenate blood to die of the stupid stuff because he forgot to suit up. P.S. The soldiers in Scalzi's Old Men's war series have smartblood that can hold more oxygen, which enables them to do some amazing things without breathing. Still, they wear pressure suits all the time. 

What does this mean for a low tech population trying to build space-worthy vehicles? It means, they are screwed. They need to contain liquid fuels, some of which need to be pressurized, within a container that is only allowed to weight about 1/8 of the total fuel mass. It is quite hard even for us today to build such light-weight structures that are still strong enough, and we have lost rockets as recent as 2015 (Falcon 9 launch failure) due to structures that did not hold up under the forces exerted on them. Low tech means, you need to include high safety margins to avoid catastrophic failure, and high safety margins mean much more fuel, and much more rocket to hold that fuel. The lower your tech level, the larger the rockets need to be. We need rockets that outweight their payloads by a factor 25, just to get some small payload into space. How big will that factor be for your low-tech people? Can you imagine your low-tech people building significantly larger rockets than the ones we build today? If not, I'd say, any space-faring society needs to be at least at our level of development in the middle of the 20th century, when we first started sending rockets into space. And all this does not even include any potential for fighting battles in space...
