Circles! Well, some of them, anyway. You can plot any azimuthal projection in polar coordinates, where the radius is a function of the angular distance from the center point. So where two points' angular distances are the same, their radii are the same, and the projection of any locus of constant angular distance from the center point is a circle, if it appears at all. Since you said that the tangent point is a pole, that means that parallels (lines of constant latitude) are those lines of constant angular distance. Ergo, Northern Hemisphere parallels appear as circles. 

If you were hoping for a smooth succession from Archean all the way down to Quaternary, you're going to be disappointed. Geology is messier than rocks being serenely laid down continuously through time like that. A drive from the Appalachians to the East Coast would get you everything but the Archaean rocks, although the only Proterozoic rocks would be found in the Piedmont. The tough part is finding rocks of Archaen age. Although the North American craton contains Archaen rocks, they are only at the surface in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota (That is, if we restrict ourselves to the United States as you asked), and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. There are a few outcrops in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Here's a link to a large detailed geological map of the three states. But this is just the bedrock geology. The trouble with looking for Archean age rocks in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, of course, is that these areas are mostly covered by glacial till from recent ice ages (although you might find an Archean glacial erratic that the ice sheets carried down from Canada). Archean outcrops might be small and inaccessible. 

I don't know if one answer can list all the positives, but one I can think of is this: In many (not all) places of the world winter produces the most violent storms. Because deciduous trees lose their leaves during winter, they thus have less wind resistance, which in turn lessens--but does not eliminate--their vulnerability to being toppled over by severe winds.And of course, hibernating species take advantage of winter by sleeping through it and pretty much staying awake for the rest of the year. (I sometimes wish we humans could do the same.) 

The helium in natural gas wells is created from uranium and thorium (as you correctly state) contained in the underlying granite basement rock or radioactive black shales that allows the natural gas to be trapped and contained. It's not that the helium is created from the fossil hydrocarbons, but that it comes from the rocks that trap those hydrocarbons (source). 

The short answer is, bauxite requires a particular alumina-rich source rock and a specific set of conditions and processes to concentrate the aluminum in a specific order. From the Encyclopedia of Arkansas: 

(Source, Arkansas Geological Survey; a very detailed map can be downloaded here) The source rock (nepheline syenite) for the bauxite appears as two isolated blue spots in the middle of the map above, surrounded by (orange) Tertiary sedimentary deposits. The town of Bauxite is just to the northwest of the southern spot. Rather than cut and paste EOA's description of the process, I decided on the following summary: 

(Wikimedia Commons) Since the Gnomonic projection can show only a single hemisphere, the Equator and parallels in the Southern hemisphere can't appear at all -- they would be an infinite distance from the center point. The polar orientation of the projection even takes away complications resulting from the earth's not being a perfect sphere -- the radius formula changes a little, but the equal results from the same input remain. 

These are from the EPA's site for 2013. The top is USA emissions and the bottom, global. I guess that's the most recent year for which they have complete results. And you're right; electricity and transportation account for 58% of total CO2 emissions. 

The main reason why impact craters are close to symmetrically round is because it's the explosion of the impactor, not its collision, that creates the impact crater. The impactor is travelling so fast that, rather than simply exploding on impact, it burrows deep into the collision site, heats up from compression and friction, and explodes deep underground, thus creating a more-or-less perfectly round crater. 

Much of western California is composed of small lighter landmasses scraped off of the Pacific Plate as the heavier mantle sank under the North American Plate, and the San Francisco Bay Area is no exception. Here's an illustration of how some of CA was formed as the Pacific Plate was subducted under the North American Plate: As these separate landmasses were scraped off the Pacific Plate, they formed distinct rock types, with the boundary of each forming a distinct fault. Here's a good illustration of what that looks today:Of course, these faults and rock types will be different depending on what cross section you're looking at.I know this isn't a complete description, but I think it's a good starting point. These illustrations came from USGS bulletin 2195, which can be found here. It's an interesting read in and of itself. 

Source: USGS (via usu.edu) But BUT BUT it seems you want to know what happens to existing mountains. Some others have answered that only erosion destroys mountains, and that's mostly right, but only because it's a matter of timing. It's often difficult for us humans to comprehend just how big geological time scales are. Most of the time, a mountain range created by a continental collision is eroded away completely by the time the next rift comes along. This was the case along the eastern seaboard of the United States. The mountains created by the collosion of Africa and North America in the Carboniferous (the Alleghenian Orogeny) were almost completely gone by the Triassic, when the Atlantic Ocean began to form from a rift along about the same line. However, we have an example that might result in a qualified "yes" to your question, a little closer to the present. This is the way the Yellowstone Hotspot moved across what would become the northwestern United States. One of the things that caused geologists to recognize the Yellowstone Caldera was the 80km gap it melted in a mountain range it passed under, separating the Gallatin Range in the north from the Red Range in the south. The hotspot's track might just be the genesis of a new rift that breaks North America apart, given enough time and the right stresses. 

This is actually a more complicated question than it seems on the surface (no pun intended). The short answer is that the volume vacated by the magma is eventually refilled by the very tectonic processes that filled it in the first place. Crust is subducted, molten, and then rises to fill magma chambers. The process goes on and on. In some cases the plate that was being subducted eventually disappears (this will happen to the Juan de Fuca plate in a few million years), and the volcanoes associated with become extinct, not dormant but extinct. But generally speaking, volcanism is an ongoing process; the Earth is constantly recycling crustal material 

As njuffa alludes to there is a current just offshore from the California coast. This is a deep, cold ocean current. As it hits the continental shelf off the coast it is deflected upwards towards the ocean's surface. But here's where it gets different: a thermal low that forms in the Central Valley of California during the summer draws in the air from the Pacific through the delta and bay waters. As that air meets the cold upwelling water that was deflected upward by the continental shelf, it draws moisture from it. That cold water also cools the air which then forms fog and gets drawn into San Francisco. As that moist air gets drawn further inland, it warms sufficiently for the fog to return to vapor. This actually cools the Central Valley to where this onshore breeze (we call it the delta breeze) gets shut off, the valley warms again, and the whole cycle repeats. Of course, other weather factors (position of the Eastern Pacific High, for instance) can override this process, but it is pretty much the standard summertime pattern. If you need citations, I'm not sure I can provide them, as this is something I learned in a physical geography class in college many years ago. I've also seen some other explanations that are just plain wrong. 

From an Earth Science standpoint, it's meaningless to ask about the "source" of a river in this way. The "source" of a river is the rainfall within its drainage basin, which percolates down into groundwater, and the "river" appears where the land has eroded down below the water table. The Amazon has an enormous drainage basin: 

(Source: Steven Dutch, University of Wisconsin Green Bay) $URL$ Wisconsin has late Archaen ("Penokean" craton) rocks and the same lack of later rocks as Minnesota. Wisconsin has a field-trip planning site with an interactive outcrop map at this link. If you could get access to the Black Hills outcrops (uplifted bits of the "Wyoming" craton), you might be able to approximate what tou want with a trip east through South Dakota, starting in the Black Hills. I haven't found an image of South Dakota geology appropriate for embedding, but Here is a link to a large, detailed PDF of South Dakota geology, and here is another link to an interactive site with generalized SD geology. 

When wildfire acreage is reported, does anyone know if local terrain is taken into consideration, or is the reported acreage the area as viewed on a map? I ask because the two figures are different. A square unit of area on a 30Â° slope would appear to be .866 square units on a map, whereas a square unit of area on a map would actually be 1.155 units of area on the slope (assuming I've done the math correctly, which I think I have). I'm guessing it's just the area as viewed on a map, because figuring out the average terrain would be pretty difficult, though not impossible. 

The hill to the south in your map is called Palm Hill, probably because of its somewhat resemblance to a palm frond. It is an erosion-resistant hill or knoll that protrudes above the surrounding alluvial plain. As @KnobScratcher points out, the feature is the result of erosion in that it created the alluvial plain that surrounds the knoll. Erosion also sculpted the small gullies that make the structure resemble a palm frond. Without the alluvial plain to fill in the valleys surrounding the knoll, and thus make the hilltop stand out, I doubt it would be very noteworthy.Most likely the structure to the north is of the same origin.There is a Larkspur, CA planning document that gives blurb about Palm Hill. It is on page seven of this document. 

(Source:Wikimedia Commons) This is the Matterhorn in the Alps on the Swiss-Italian border. The word horn is used in glacial geomorphology to refer to a mountain peak that has been ground by glaciers on many sides to create a "pyramidal peak" with sheer, faceted sides. During the Pleistocene ice ages, the Alps were covered in an ice sheet much like Antarctica is today, and undoubtedly at some point the tip of the Matterhorn poked through the top of the ice, looking very similar to the mountain in your picture. 

Both the original laterite and the alluvial deposits have been mined for aluminum. Your assertion that there are no other bauxite deposits in the US is not true; other deposits formed in similar conditions in the southeastern US, and there is also bauxite in Montana.
