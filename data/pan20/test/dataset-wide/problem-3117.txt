The USSR growth rate during the 50's was not exceptionally high. The claims of more than 10% growth, although certainly theoretically possible, were simply not true, but Soviet propaganda. Real growth rates during the 50's and 60's were rather 4-7% depending on time period and who is doing the estimation. This can be compared to average OECD and average global growth during the same period at 4%. As for the implied question of why they didn't do as badly as they did later (and earlier) the answer is that the 50's and early 60's in the Soviet Union was a period that saw: 

Arians were not underrepresented at the council of Nicaea Arius started saying that the Son was distinct from the father under Alexander of Alexandria, so it's probably in 313 or so. So Arianism was less than twelve years old at the Council. So the reason there were so few Arians on this council was that Arianism was a very new thing, not that they were underrepresented. At the council of Nicaea there were a few bishops who supported Arius position (Warren Carroll claims 22). But they didn't prevail, and the two you mention are the only ones who preferred to be thrown out of the church than to sign the Nicean creed. (Source: Carroll again) Your further comments and claims about there being many Arians are first of all not evidence that Arianism was widespread. It's just points out some notable Arians, but it says nothing about how widespread it was. 

Robespierre was of the opinion that the best way to ensure the success of the revolution was to execute all the enemies of the revolution. A tyrannical position that he, as so many others, justified with nonsensical slogans. 

Neither Croatia nor Serbia existed after the war and hence hey could neither pay nor receive reparations. Yugoslavia would have ended up paying reparations to Yugoslavia, which would have been fairly pointless. 

There was indeed fighting in what is today Iran during WWI. It is hard to say exactly how many died in that fighting, most sources just list casualties for the Ottoman Empire as a whole, which is below 3 million, and that includes around half a million war dead and 1 to 1.5 million that died in the Armenian genocide. (sources) But I can't find any sources on how many that dies in the Persian campaign, or how many Persians died. However, the question seems to not actually or at least originally be about this. Instead it's a question about how many that does of a famine during the war. The claims of a major famine in Persia comes from the book "The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919". I can't find any references to a famine in Persia that doesn't trace back to that book. In this book Mohammad Gholi Majd claims that the population of Iran in 1900 was 12 million, and in 1910 was 15 million. He then draws the conclusion that the population in 1920 therefore should have been 18-20 million by "natural progression", a conclusion that can not be made, and is contradicted by sources. But since the population in fact were 11 million, not 20, he claims that 8-10 million must have died from starvation. Not only does this reasoning not hold up to scrutiny, there is nothing that says that the population should have increased to 20 million by "natural progression" in that way. In addition other sources contradict his population claims. All other sources agree that the population of what is now Iran was slightly below 10 million in 1900 and slightly above 10 million in 1910. (see Pieter Geerkens sources from comments: 1, 2, 3) There does seem to have been a severe lack of food in 1917-1918. Lack of food is a common effect of war, and in this case it seems to have been compounded by drought. But it is quite clear that the gigantic famine with millions of dead in Iran that Majd writes about isn't something that really happened. 

There are several questions in here. I'll try to address each one: Q1: Did Gorbachev betray his voters who voted for a return to Leninist ideals? No. The reason he didn't do that is twofold. 

No, there are no instances of "Country X does not meet health standards" leading the United States to stop trade with that country. There are however plenty of cases when the United States (and also other countries) have stopped imports of particular products from particular because of health concerns. Countries where there are outbreak of "mad cow disease" will typically see other countries shutting down import of beef, as an example. 

Sugar went from luxury to "necessity", to people actually eating much more of it than is even remotely healthy, because it went from expensive, to affordable, to really, really cheap. This development is paralleled by a lot of other foodstuffs, and is a part of the general agricultural/industrial revolution and globalization that has happened the last centuries. 

The Sykes-Picot agreement did not divide the middle east into countries, but only into areas of occupation. These areas were French occupation, British occupation, Russian occupation, French protectorate, British protectorate and International zones. These areas do not correspond with later country borders, so your conjecture that the Sykes-Picot agreement divided the middle east into the current countries is not correct. Both Syria and Lebanon was in the French protectorate, for example, and these states were created by the French, not by the Sykes-Picot agreement. 

It was financed by the emperors, and hence it's ultimate financing was from taxes and spoils of war. An article in Biblical Archeology review shows findings that suggest that the Colosseum primarily was financed by spoils or war, and in fact suggests it may be the sacking of Jerusalem that financed much of it, but that is conjecture. 

Currency comes in many different forms, and since you mention "abstract" currency here, that excludes coins that were traded for their metal value, which is the case of most early coinage, where the stamp was an mark guaranteeing that it was reasonably pure metal. The first abstract coinage is probably dependent on your opinion on what "abstract" means. The roman empire quite quickly started debasing it's coinage so that the face value was higher than the metal value, and that could be argued as making it "abstract". On the other hand this practice sometimes led to inflation, so it's clear that the metal value wasn't irrelevant. Other cases of abstract money is when you start using paper as emergency currency, basically printing paper notes as future promises of real money. Thusly they were still tied to metal value, even though it is abstract in the meaning that the value was not in the paper. When the usage of banknotes was (re)invented in Sweden in 1660, they were also a form of promissory notes and you could (in theory) redeem them in real coinage. However, the Stockholm Banco bank folded in 1664 and was taken over by the state, which continued the practice of printing paper money without being actually able to cover for it, should everybody ask for coins at the same time. This could also be seen as the first "abstract" money as there was no real coverage for it. However, the bank notes continued to be nominally tied to metal value, even though this was often not actually true during times of crisis. Many countries suspended the ex changeability of notes to gold or solver during WWI, for example. Properly abstract currency, ie currency that does not nave any notional intrinsic value at all and does not pretend to have it, didn't arrive until 1971, when Nixon ended the convertibility of dollars to gold. Since most currencies in the world at that time had a fixed exchange ration to dollars, that also in practice meant that almost all currencies in the world became truly abstract in one go. 

It's quite obvious that this is the same quote as the first quote, but avoiding these modern terms that made the first quote such an obvious fake. However, this new quote may use language that fits better with the times, but it uses them in an incorrect way and with almost incomprehensible grammar. 

2001-2008 was not a time of rebellion and danger of public health and safety. The arguments of the court can be found here: $URL$ He was not acquitted of his charges, as he was never charged with anything. (That's the whole point, if he had been arrested and charged with something, his habeas corpus would not have been violated). He was detained because he knew Bensayah Belkacem, who was detained for the heinous crime of making a lot of telephone calls to Afghanistan. 

Massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire goes back to at least 1894, but they increased during WWI. What is referred to as the Armenian Genocide is however sometimes limited to the events that happened during the mass deportation of Armenians in 1915-1916. The deportations ended in March 1916, and this ended the main part of the Armenian genocide, but anti-Armenian policy did not stop, and there was massacres of Armenians after this point as well. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was during WWI a military man, and was during the deportations in charge of first the 19th Division and the the XVI Army Corps, busy defending the western end of the Empire. As a leading officer he surely would have been aware of the deportations, but did not order them or participate in them, and I can find no evidence that he was involved in any of the massacres before the deportations either. Atatürk was the leader of the Turkish Independence War, and as such nominally responsible for massacres during this period. However, he blamed the Turkish people and it's "excited state". As he was a turk-nationalist and started a policy of oppressing and Turkifying minorities, it is quite likely that he supported the anti-Armenian policies. In August 1921 his nationalists took several Britons hostage (I've seen the numbers 22 and 29) and then made an exchange for the Turks that was detained for their involvement in the genocide. The conclusion of this is that Atatürk is not to blame for the Genocide and does not have seem to be directly involved in either the deportations, nor the massacres. However, he does not seem to have opposed them, and possibly supported them. He certainly did nothing to stop them, even after he came to power. 

Today I learned that Swedish king Gustav III supposedly took two twin brothers that had been convicted for murder and had them drink three pots of coffee and tea respectively per day. He supposedly did this to prove that coffee was bad for you, but ironically he got assassinated before either of the brother died. However, there seems to be no contemporary records of this twin study so we don't know if it really happened. But that leads me to the question: What was the first documented twin study? Wikipedia references one in 1905, but that seems to be more about studying twins, than doing the type of twin study where you use twins to look for environmental factors, which is what Gustav III did. 

The map shows the general shape of South an Central America, and the general shape of the Atlantic coast of North America. If it shows it in "such detail" or not is a matter of opinion. Sure, a lot of things are correct, but a lot of things are incorrect. The question then is how they could know the general shape of South and Central America at all, and the reason is simple: They had been there. Once people realized that Columbus didn't reach Asia, but discovered new land there was a large-scale effort by Spain to explore and map the new lands, which Spain had claimed for itself. As Spain did not claim North America, they didn't make such an effort to explore it and map it. Therefore North America is mostly blank on this map, and the west coast is completely missing. A lot of things on the map is also simply guessing. For example, the Amazon river is on the map. But as it's not explored, it's just shown as a big snake, which is not how it looks at all. They knew there was a huge river, because they had explored it's mouth, but that is all they knew. You can also see that the southernmost tip of America is completely wrong. The southern end of America looks like a narrow straight, with another big landmass to the south, and it might easily be thought that this is Antarctica. But in fact, what is shows is the Straight of Magellan with Tierra del Fuego to the south. It was believed up until 1578 that the Island of Tierra del Fuego was a part of a larger landmass, possibly the mythical "Terra Australis". So a lot of things on this map is correct, and that's simply thanks to 70 years with of exploring and map making by the Spanish. And a lot of things are incorrect, because they had not explored enough yet, and map making technology was still quite primitive. Update: I realized that the Gutiérrez map did show Longitude, each degree is marked on the equator. It also has the tropics marked, and it turns out the tropics are marked on the right distance from the equator for this to fit with an equirectangular map projection. So here is an overlay of the Gutiérrez map with a modern equirectangular map: 

Manuel da Silva Rosa, an information technology analyst, claims that Columbus was the son of Władysław III of Poland (and Hungary, but for some reason nobody seems to mention that). To make this claim, he has to first claim that Władysław III, who died in a battle in 1444 without having children and had his head displayed on a pole, for no good reason faked his death and moved to Madeira, where he assumed the name "Henrique Alemão" (Henry the German). This Henrique Alemão, which did exist and lived in Madeira, had two children. Sigismund, who was lost at sea on the way to Lisbon, and a daughter Barbara. As there is evidence Columbus lived in Genua, Rosa also claims that this evidence concerns a completely different Christopher Columbus. But since Columbus himself said that he was from Genua, this means that Columbus in fact must be the aforementioned Sigismund, who must at some point have faked his death (runs in the family, apparently) and stolen this Genuese mans identity. The purpose of stealing this mans identity was apparently to protect the secret that his father had been a king. Why this needed to be a secret is unknown to me. And none of this is actually corroborated by evidence in his book. The main argument is that because Columbus married a noble women, he has to have been noble himself. Which means it is a conspiracy theory, because a lot of people high up in Spanish society must have known that he in fact was the son of a polish king who faked his own death, but they must all have been complicit in not telling anyone else or ever writing this down.
