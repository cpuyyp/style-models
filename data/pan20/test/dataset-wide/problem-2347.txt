Doing multipitch routes with double ropes is great, but (at least for me) inevitably results in messy tangles, twists, and crosses of the two ropes. What are some strategies to prevent the ropes from tangling? 

I'll address the mountaineering viewpoint (as opposed to the other good answers about the climbing viewpoint). Mountaineering usually involves covering a lot of distance over a bunch of different terrains: flat trails, scrambling/climbing, snow/ice, etc. A mountaineering boot thus needs to be able to do all of these in a single pair of boots, and be comfortable all day (or for multiple days). Not an easy task! Mountaineering boots are designed to allow the climber to walk relatively comfortably, climb with some precision, and connect securely with crampons. Climbing shoes excel at climbing, but it's pretty much impossible to walk for long distances with them. In the end, the amount of distance to cover will require a boot that fits well enough for walking, so the boot needs to fit closer to a street shoe than a climbing shoe. 

Research studies into squirrel sounds and their meanings are extensive and ongoing, so even though she absolutely has alarm calls, they're not always easy to understand. They depend on many factors, partly including the type and vicinity of the predator. Also, for the first several months after her youngsters are weaned, mom continues to do some surveillance, so her calls might be for protection of those that are independent but still in a maturation process. Some alert calls are used to warn other adult squirrels of the presence of danger, in case they'd prefer to stay away. Those are usually used in her territory but not near the nest. There appear to be three most frequently used alarm calls. 

We have American mourning doves in abundance in Massachusetts. They spend months in our yard, eating seeds both on the ground and in the feeders. They also peck around in my flower garden, so I think they might be eating grubs and insects. We see many of them every day, rain or shine. I love their plaintive cooing sound. It's hauntingly beautiful. I used to think it was an owl call but know better now. What's interesting is that the call sounds like it's coming from a distance away. It doesn't sound close enough to be at my feeders. I've never seen a bird using their mouth in such a way as to think I was watching them speak. Even when they're in the tree branch above the feeders, as in my second picture, they look and seem silent. I know it's not because they're nocturnal, as I hear it all day, though sometimes louder towards dusk. I don't think I'm just missing it, as I frequently sit outside with them for hours. There's a whooshing sound when they rise from the ground, but that comes from the flapping of their wings, and stops when they land. Do these American mourning doves ever make that lovely cooing sound on the ground, feeder, or anyplace where people can see them? If not, why not? The first picture is of their favorite feeder, which is on a pole about six feet in the air. Frequently at least four share that eating space, with one or two sitting on top waiting for their turn. The second picture is on a branch beside a rope that leads to a feeder a few feet down. The third is on the roof of my sunroom, where they sip water as it runs down in rivulets after a rain. 

Will Gadd's book Ice & Mixed Climbing states that if you mess up the first attempt at a V-thread, start over in clean ice. This includes if your screw holes intersect only partway down the hole, the two holes didn't intersect, or the distance between the holes isn't large enough. Practicing making V-threads on the ground is much better than trying to figure it out on rappel when it's cold, dark, and everyone is soaked. A good rule of thumb for all anchors (but especially rappel anchors) is to make the best anchor possible with what you have available. Fortunately, on most ice climbs starting over means moving over a foot or two to solid ice. In some cases, building a "textbook" anchor may not be possible. If you have to use an anchor that is less than optimal, make a backup anchor and clip the rope to this backup in case your V-thread fails. You want the backup to be relatively taught but all of the weight should be on the primary V-thread (just a little bit loose). The last person will remove the backup when they rappel. This Petzl video shows a good example of this (at 4 minutes). 

I live in Massachusetts, United States. A large number of backyard birds overwinter in our yard. Some of the smaller varieties include American Goldfinch, American Tree Sparrows, European Starlings. The larger ones include Northern Cardinals and Mourning Doves. Many have been here all year, and are accustomed to our landscape. They know where our feeders and bird baths are located, and that we keep them stocked with fresh food and water. Beginning in November, and lasting for months, the water in the bird baths freezes. We bang out the ice, then clean and fill them with fresh water. That works for a while, but by the depth of winter, the water freezes more quickly than we can keep up with it. We keep some small saucers close to the house, which are easy enough to handle, but our full-size feeders are a distance away, larger, and harder to maintain. (I admit I'm not always in the mood to trudge out a few times a day to break the ice!) This year we're considering buying a few submersible water heaters. (I've seen them called both heaters and de-icers. I'm not sure what the difference is, or if it's an important thing to know.) They're designed to go into an existing birdbath. They come with cords which plug in, and have thermostats which keep the water from freezing. They come in many different sizes, shapes, types of materials, thermostat ranges, lengths and widths of cord, wattage levels. Some are round, others flat. I've heard of one that has timers which turn on during the times of day when birds are more likely to be active. I think those are designed to save the cost of electricity, but they're more expensive to buy, so it probably balances out in the end! We don't need something like that. I've also seen free-standing heated bird baths, but we're not interested in adding to our collection. Some of our feeders are plastic, others are ceramic and concrete. The diameters vary, from approximately 17 inches to 25 inches. None are deeper than 3 inches at the deepest part, as that's the maximum depth recommended for small birds. Here are the most important criteria: 

Some types of spores can survive boiling. But they're either not disease-causing or they're not in any condition to make you sick as far as I know. 

If your sleeping bag, or its compression bag, doesn't have straps around the outside, you'll need at least four pieces of twine to strap your bag down. Two to loop around the sleeping bag, and two more to link the loops on your bag to the loops on your backpack. Make sure the pieces intended for linking the sleeping bag to the backpack are tied down by the pieces looping the sleeping bag. It gets trickier if you want your bag and your tent to hang off those straps. The bag and the tent will have to be either lashed together or containerized, first. But then the same idea applies. 

Regular sunglasses should give you protection from snow blindness, so long as they protect against UV radiation. How well they protect you is dependent on how well the lenses cover your eyes, and how well the lenses or coatings filter or deflect UV radiation. 

Completely personal preference. The only thing to do are keep it out of the sun (check), dry (check... I hope), and away from corrosives and other sharp things (definitely check). I usually store it in the rope bag in whatever shape it was last used. Generally, that's flaked out (make sure to tie the ends to the bag). Sometimes, that's coiled (if I was multipitch climbing). 

Unfortunately nail polish would probably gunk up the locking mechanism. I wouldn't put nail polish on any moving piece of a carabiner. You can use nail polish to mark your gear so you know that it's yours (and not your partner's). You may be able to find a multi-color scheme that indicates the carabiner's date, but generally that's not an issue (if it looks worn out, replace it). Carabiners last a long time. 

In addition to zoul's excellent answer, the Bowline has another drawback in that it can come loose (or even undone) after repeated load/unload cycles (i.e. weighing and unweighing the rope). This means that the bowline is not as good as the figure-8 to use to tie-in a climber, especially for multi-pitch climbing, gym climbing, etc... (That said, many good climbers do use the bowline to tie in.) 

You're correct that these Torresian Crows can, at times, exhibit aggressive behavior, and, unlike some other crows, may directly attack people. It stems from a defensive parental instinct though, and is territorial in nature. According to The Brisbane City Council's page on Swooping Animals, they, and some of Brisbane's other native birds, are most likely to swoop people during peak breeding time, which is between July and December. As you've found out by experience, each nesting cycle during that time usually lasts up to six weeks. The swooping is a normal defensive behavior, generally caused by a bird with eggs or newly hatched young in the nest. The people who are most vulnerable are those who are closest to the nest. The crows do establish territories which extend beyond the actual nest, and may include your backyard, street, local park or field areas, or buildings like an office or school, so people may not even know where the nest is. In your case though, the nest is right nearby, so you know exactly where it is, and, unfortunately, you're in the direct path of the most vulnerability! There are things you can do, some of which you've tried, which, unfortunately, haven't been working for you. The WildlifeQld Snake Catcher Brisbane & Bird Management is a good source of have information about birds and crows, including a page dedicated solely to the Torresian Crow (Covus orru). As you said, they're protected in your area, for several reasons, primarily because they provide natural pest management. They eat insects and small rodents in agricultural, woodland and suburban gardens. Through defecation in these areas, they disperse seeds which helps growth and survival of native crops. They also eat animals which are already deceased in the road, providing assistance with clean-up, and also creating a continuing benefit to the ecosystem. The following is their advice. I know you've tried some of these things, but I'm leaving them in so the answer includes the complete list. 

In most cases, a craft without a motor has the right of way. On your raft, you'd be free to use the width of the river channel as you saw fit. However, large ships with deep drafts, like river cruisers or river barges, are typically confined to a particular lane in the river. Their right to use the lane supersedes your right of way as an unpowered craft. You would have to make way. If you're passing another vessel on equal terms, say coming head on with a small powerboat, tradition dictates that both you pass each other port-to-port. The left side of your vessel passes the other ship on its left; aim your raft to the right of vessels you're passing head-on. You might consider posting red and green lights on your port and starboard sides, respectively. For that matter, you might even consider building a mast and flying a flag to increase your visibility. Just don't fly anything with an established meaning, like diver-down, or the NATO alphanumeric flags. Your country of origin, upright, would be enough. You should talk to cruise ship captains and lock masters on the river for more advice about the Danubue in particular. The Danube has locks, and the lock masters decide if and when a vessel can enter the lock. I have no idea if a lock master would allow a hand-built raft into a lock, but if you're considering it, you should ask in advance. The cruise ship captains operating on the Danube could give you more practical advice about the nature of the river and your responsibilities on the Danube.
