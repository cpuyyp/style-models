Yes, you are absolutely right, from OUR VIEWPOINT it does. From Kip Thorne's book "Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy." “Like a rock dropped from a rooftop, the star’s surface falls downward (shrinks inward) slowly at first, then more and more rapidly. Had Newton’s laws of gravity been correct, this acceleration of the implosion would continue inexorably until the star, lacking any internal pressure, is crushed to a point at high speed. Not so according to Oppenheimer and Snyder’s relativistic formulas. Instead, as the star nears its critical circumference, its shrinkage slows to a crawl. The smaller the star gets, the more slowly it implodes, until it becomes frozen precisely at the critical circumference. No matter how long a time one waits, if one is at rest outside the star (that is, at rest in the static external reference frame) one will never be able to see the star implode through the critical circumference. That is the unequivocal message of Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas.” “Is this freezing of the implosion caused by some unexpected, general relativistic force inside the star? No, not at all, Oppenheimer and Snyder realized. Rather, it is caused by gravitational time dilation (the slowing of the flow of time) near the critical circumference. Time on the imploding star’s surface, as seen by static external observers, must flow more and more slowly, when the star approaches the critical circumference, and correspondingly everything occurring on or inside the star including its implosion must appear to go into slow motion and then gradually freeze.” “As peculiar as this might seem, even more peculiar was another prediction made by Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas: Although, as seen by static external observers, the implosion freezes at the critical circumference, it does not freeze at all as viewed by observers riding inward on the star’s surface. If the star weighs a few solar masses and begins about the size of the sun, then as observed from its own surface, it implodes to the critical circumference in about an hour’s time, and then keeps right on imploding past criticality and on in to smaller circumferences.” “By looking at Oppenheimer and Snyder’s formulas from the viewpoint of an observer on the star’s surface, one can deduce the details of the implosion, even after the star sinks within its critical circumference; that is one can discover that the star gets crunched to infinite density and zero volume, and one can deduce the details of the spacetime curvature at the crunch.” P217-218 OK, so from our perspective all the matter will be clustered around the critical circumference and no further. That's fine, this shell in theory can exert all the forces required on the external universe such as gravitational attraction, magnetic field etc. The point like singularity which is in the indefinite future of the black hole, (from our point of view) indeed in the indefinite future of the universe itself could not exert such forces on this universe. This singularity is only "reached" as an observer rides in past the critical circumference and, through the process of time dilation, reaches the end of the universe. This is obviously an area of active research and thinking. Some of the greatest minds on the planet are approaching this issue in different ways but so far have not reached a consensus but intriguingly a consensus appears to be beginning to emerge. $URL$ Stephen Hawking said at a conference in August 2015 that he believes that "information is stored not in the interior of the black hole as one might expect, but on its boundary, the event horizon." His comment refers to the resolution of the "information paradox," a long-running physics debate in which Hawking eventually concedes that the material that falls into a black hole isn't destroyed, but rather becomes part of the black hole. Read more at: $URL$ In the mid-90s, American and Dutch physicists Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft also addressed the information paradox by proposing that when something gets sucked into a black hole, its information leaves behind a kind of two-dimensional holographic imprint on the event horizon, which is a sort of ‘bubble’ that contains a black hole through which everything must pass. What occurs at the event horizon of a black hole is very hard to understand. What is clear, and what proceeds from General Relativity, is that from the viewpoint of an external observer in this universe, any infalling matter cannot proceed past the critical circumference. Most scientists then change the viewpoint to explain how, from the viewpoint of an infalling observer, they will proceed in a very short period of time to meet the singularity at the centre of the black hole. This has given rise to the notion that there is a singularity at the centre of every black hole. However this is is an illusion, as the time it will take to reach the singularity is essentially infinite to us in the external universe. The fact that the matter cannot proceed past the critical circumference is perhaps not an “illusion” but very real. The matter must from OUR VIEWPOINT become a “shell” surrounding the critical circumference. It will never fall through the circumference while we remain in this universe. So to talk of a singularity inside a black hole is incorrect. It has not happened yet. The path through the event horizon does lead to a singularity in each case, but it is indefinitely far in the future in all cases. If we are in this universe, no singularity has yet been formed. If it has not been formed yet, where is the mass?  The mass is exerting pull on this universe, correct?  Then it must be IN this universe.  From our point of view it must be just this side of the event horizon. ASTONISHINGLY IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO PROVE THIS. The recent announcement of gravitational waves detected on the merger of 2 black holes was accompanied by an unverified but potentially matching gamma ray burst from the same area of the sky. This is inexplicable from the conventional viewpoint which holds that all the matter would be compressed into a singularity and would be incapable of coming out again. If 2 black holes merge and emit gamma rays… the above is certainly an explanation which is also consistent with General Relativity. The mass never quite made it through the event horizon (from our viewpoint) and was perturbed by the huge violence of the merger, some escaping. It may be a deep gravitational well, but a very powerful gamma ray should just be able to escape given the right kick (attraction by an even larger black hole approaching). Further more refined observations of similar events, which are likely to be reasonably frequent, may provide more evidence. There is not likely to be any other credible explanation. 

This result is due to Hawking radiation. Due to random quantum fluctuations, particles are radiated from a black hole. When the black hole has a mass less than the Moon, it will evaporate. EDIT I should add that any black holes created can only have the mass of the particles involved in the collision - two protons. So it's not going to do any harm before it evaporates. However, we would learn a lot from the event. 

There may be other causes, since not all HVSs seem to be explained by these mechanisms. Perhaps some of them are not from this galaxy at all - they may be just passing through. 

No, black holes are not the only cause of HVSs, although it is thought to be the most common mechanism. Hyper velocity stars are believed to be caused 

No. According to the Nasa Venus fact sheet the density of the atmosphere at the surface is ~65 kg/m^3. For comparison, water is 1000 kg/m^3. We only just float in water. So if you were there, in a suit that could somehow withstand the heat (464 C), the "air" would feel thick. Maybe a person could strap on some wings and fly ... 

The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. It is constant, unless some interaction such as a collision between bodies occurs. The kinetic energy is easy to understand. For a mass $m$ and velocity $v$ it is given by $$E_k = ½mv^2$$ The potential energy formula is (technically) given as $$U = -μm/r$$ where $μ$ is the Standard gravitational parameter. (I say technically because it can be hard to grasp the concept of negative energy. See the linked articles). In the case of a hyperbolic orbit the velocity and distance from the sun must be measured; one cannot be derived from the other as is the case with a known elliptical orbit. See also 

So Copernicus was noting that this is indeed what we observe. At the North pole the North celestial pole is directly overhead, and on the equator it is on the horizon. This observation, therefore, is direct evidence that the Earth is spherical (or at least spheroidal). You can see the evidence of this in star trail photographs. The stars will always appear to rotate about the celestial poles. This image shows the star trails above Ecuador, at a latitude of about 1$^{\circ}$. You can clearly see that the stars are rolling directly over head; with the North and South celestial poles located on the horizon to the right and left, respectively. 

This is from an article in the Conversation, by Duane W. Hamacher, and Carla Bento Guedes: "Voyagers measure the angles between stars and the horizon using their hands. The width of your pinkie finger at arm’s length is roughly one degree, or double the angular diameter of the Sun or Moon. Hold your hand with the palm facing outward and thumb fully extended, touching the horizon. Each part of your hand is used to measure a particular altitude. 

The hand method used by Nainoa Thompson to find the altitude of the Polaris. Journal of the Polynesian Society In Hawai'i, the “North Star”, Polaris, is Hokupa'a, meaning “fixed star”. It lies close to the north celestial pole. The altitude of Hokupa'a indicates your northerly latitude. In the film, we see Moana Waialiki using this technique to measure the altitude of a group of stars. Look closely and you can see that she’s measuring the stars in Orion’s Belt. The position of Moana’s hand indicates the star above her index finger has an altitude of 21º. Given that the movie takes place about 2,000 years ago near Samoa, the position of Orion indicates they are travelling exactly due East. 

From my simplistic analysis, it's not good for much. For comparison, the first radio telescope was 9 meters. One of the favorite parts of the spectrum for radio telescopes is the water hole - 21 cm. From my quick mental arithmetic, this dish would be able to resolve sources of 21 cm signals of they were about 5 degrees apart. I'll update with links and more when my computer is working; this is written on my phone :-) 

It depends how precisely you mean the same position. Take 2 since my previous attempt was ... optimistic. In the late 1970's, the outer planets were moving into a configuration that made a Planetary Grand Tour much cheaper and quicker. They will be in a similar configuration in about 175 years. But when will the planets be in the exact configuration? Never, well, not before the Sun turns into a red giant and swallows the inner planets. But from time to time the planets will all be on the same side of the Sun. If the planets were all in a line, then after 495 years they would all be on the same side of the Sun, then again at 500 years, 522 years, 523 years (these last two are, of course 88 days apart, the period of Mercury), 995 years, 997 years, 1006, 1183 years, etc. 

I recommend visiting a few university Astronomy departments, and investigating their PhD programmes. While a PhD may seem like a big thing to undertake as a retired person (and it is), you will certainly be doing real research. Just discussing the possibilities with people in a few Astronomy departments will lead to other ideas, or actual research projects you can participate in. Good luck.
