What does it mean to categorize? It means to put things in piles which are distinct, where every thing goes in the right pile, and the definitions of the piles actually separates the things logically, with an absolute true/false distinction. And what does it mean to categorically assert or deny something -- it means that there is absolute truth, or no truth to it -- that the assertion or denial has an absolute truth value. So categorical means "having the form of a distinct property with a binary truth value". (One meaning of the root /agoreuein/ is 'to predicate', but this is less than fully compelling because another is 'to harangue'. From the examples above, we have to take it that Aristotle meant the former, and that is the use that has come down to German and English usage, and into Kant's hands and ours.) For something to be universal and categorical at the same time, absolutely everyone would give it the same binary truth value. If we can lie 'for good reason' then there should be a meaning of 'good reason' that all of us can agree on. All of us -- even Nazis or deranged murderers seeking their next victim -- should have our status as real actors respected. You cannot have your person-hood revoked just by being the wrong person. If you can prove a stronger result, with Kant, you have to accept it over the weaker result. Period. If there is a deduction that makes for an absolute duty, and one that makes for a contingent duty, you have an absolute duty. Choice needs to be preserve within each deduction, not between them. Trying to avoid violence by lying is putting the contingent duty to defend people from violence up against the absolute duty to maintain the ability to decide what is true. 

The idea that all positions are ultimately faith-based does not in any way suggest that they are equally valid or meaningful. There are many kinds of faith that we all share much more broadly than others -- that what we observe carefully should be repeatable, that arithmetic works, that words are usefully (though not perfectly) well-defined, etc. And we have come to social compromises on relatively faith-neutral structures, like our systems of law and our sciences, on those bases. To claim those shared positions are only as acceptable as any one particular religion is to ignore that many people across many traditions come to them independently. One is free to reject them, but only if one really rejects them, and is not being opportunistic and hypocritical. If you want to claim the world is only 8000 years old, you cannot concurrently use in carbon-dating. If you think there was a first rainbow, you cannot accept particle physics, because it is observed using optics based on the stability of refraction. If you think dinosaurs and humans lived on earth together, you cannot accept plate tectonics as a way of describing mountain formation... You can throw whatever you want out the window, but when the baby goes out with the bathwater, then no more baby. 

I think the answer to your question is yes. But your extended question means this was not the question you actually meant. This viewpoint is somewhat more Epicurean than Stoic.Turning toward what is properly your own and not not wanting what you need not be concerned with are central principles for Epicurus. Not setting goals about things only partially under your control is a matter of restraining your desire. Epicureans suggest withdrawing from the things over which you lack control and focusing on desiring what is appropriate. If your understanding of your own nature is proper, the theory goes, you should naturally wish to control just and only those things that it is natural and possible for you to have an effect on -- we are not designed to be destroyed. I think this can be applied to any situation. You cannot pursue success in business. That is a complex phenomenon over which you have little control. But you can choose important goals that you would like to introduce in the world, and know their value. If success does not follow, that does not matter, because other's opinions of your work is one of the things you should know better than to want to control. To the extent your sense of value is correct, and truly shared with other people however, you will be successful despite focusing away from success itself. (A good Epicurean has a lot in common with a good Taoist.) Stoics would consider that not very reasonable, and far too trusting of reality. Even when you think you have even partial control, you do not. Every action has a component of fortune to it, and that fortune can turn the smallest crack into a complete lack of control. Trying to estimate what degree of control you have over one thing or another just leads you to become attached to those estimates, and to be left off-balance when they are incorrect. The Stoics take more the approach of doing the proper thing even though you do not have control over any outcome, and being able to tolerate a wide range of outcomes through personal strength and faith in the propriety of your actions. Seneca, a very prominent late Stoic, was a Senator -- his goal was obviously not to avoid trying to control things. But he proposed one could persevere through the horror that was Roman politics by not allowing oneself to be hurt by failure or to become attached to one's successes. That seems quite as directly applicable to business as it was to politics, these two being very much the same games with different score-keeping. (A good Stoic has a lot in common with a good Confucian.) 

If that were the basis for allowing it, your logic would hold water. But it is not the basis for allowing it. And in fact (as my terrible, rambling answer to the given related question tries hard to clarify) "the obligation not to interfere in consensual acts where no one else is involved" is a meaningless argument, without a lot of extra analysis of the meaning of 'involved'. Given a very literal sense of 'involves', consensual sex between two people who are married to other people involves no one else. If their spouses never found out and they could guarantee no harm would befall them due to this liason, then, this logic would say they should go ahead. And that is nonsense. You need some standard for 'involves' that is broad enough to rule out this case. If you are married, your spouse must somehow be automatically involved in decisions you make to give consent to sex. If you are swingers, any children should also be automatically 'involved' in such a decision. Perhaps not directly as participants in the negotiation, but via your obligations to them. You and your spouse might adopt an open marriage. But you should not do so in a way that endangers your children's reliance upon you as a couple. For example, you should not mix partners in a way that might allow a paternity suit by a temporary partner to take children away from you as a couple who genuinely consider themselves yours, and depend upon that connection. Doing so disrespects your role as parents. This is not even necessarily about sex, just about family identity. The same should be said of shady adoptions. If you adopt a child in a way that allows the biological parents to claim him back, this is exposing him and any real or potential siblings to unnecessary potential trauma. Planning for permanence in the parental bond is part of the deal. This obligation is only compromised when doing so is clearly in the best interest of the child, not when the parents or others choose to risk it for selfish reasons of their own. Another part of the deal that traditionally comes with the family is that children should have a space safe from the pressures of sexuality and its related power issues. That place, in Western tradition, is presumed to be the extended family. So unless you make extraordinary plans to create that space elsewhere, you should forbid incest within the circle that is meant to constitute that safe space. Having, for instance, one set of siblings pair off romantically, breaks down the whole presumption that family provides a safe place for sexual innocence. So these people are involved, when you make decisions about marriages. Gay marriage does not challenge the traditional safety that parents are obligated to extend to their children in the way incest does. So these are not parallel arguments at all. They involve very different standards as to who is 'involved'. 

It could be argued that intuitive intellect is all there really is, and that the pieces into which we analyze thinking are not about intelligence, but about self-verification, social expectations and reverse engineering of designs for re-use. From a point of view like Dennett's, the brain is a massively parallel device: it makes holistic decisions based upon its entire internal state at any given instant. It is not a serial computer, like a Turing Machine. The idea that thought is piecemeal and sequentially comes together is part of our historical limitation to serial channels of communication, and has nothing to do with the actual experience of thinking. If you take that to an extreme (well beyond Dennett's own position), direct intuition is what we do. It is all we do, intellectually. Whatever has happened as put our brain in a given state, but the thought comes together instantaneously out of the whole of our experience. Mystical experience, which we attribute and generalize to God, may simply be experience without the attempt at linearization, a time where we are aware that this is what is going on, a passing instant when the brain is honest with itself about its own nature and is not immersed in social requirements to make sense to itself as it would to another being. In a psychoanalytical frame, we would think of God in those instances because we have breached the social contract and omitted our natural obligation to other story-driven beings. So we over-correct and remind ourselves of the Timeless, Ultimate Being and consider the communication to be with Him, instead. 

From a UML point of view, there are actually three things going on here, not just two. And object is of a class (instantiation/inheritance), via classes objects claim a given set of relationships (aggregation/relations), and some of those relationships are held so closely they are considered intrinsic to the objects of that class (composition/members). (These are true literally in a statically-typed world-view, but are conceptually maintained in any object framework, and almost true.) Especially in computer science, but also in real life, all being involves containing, and all containing involves having. You not only are yourself, but you also have yourself as (maximal, in some way) part and lay claim to yourself via some kind of identity relation. So, pulling back a bit, when it all comes down to it, there is only aggregation. Composition is just a matter of perspective. And inheritance is just a specific form of composition that conveys an intention to act in a given way. In practice, the distinction generally comes down to how much detail one needs to provide to the object to get something done. If I want to do something that is part of my agenda as a being, I only need to identify myself, and the intention. "I build chairs." In general, I can be a number of different things, a human animal, a chair builder (because nowadays machines can do that, and in a special sense so do companies), a mind (remains may be human but only 'have had' a mind)... But if that action is specific to a part of me, that part must be an element of my composition. "My left hand grasps the hammer." When the distinction between elements is clear, this is simple. And it is even fairly clear when they significantly overlap -- my left side and my front overlap, but they tend to play different roles in actions. To the extent that my ability to build chairs is 'a hat' I wear, it could be an aspect of my instance, inherited by the definition of 'me', or I could focus primarily on 'me' as a human and a mind, making by ability to make chairs part of my composition. This way of thinking makes for the most contention in object design, a 'state' or 'mode' or 'facet' or 'aspect' or 'perspective' [which all have specific meanings in the object-design context, or I would not list so many options] on an object is intermediate between its identity and its composition. Maybe I can't build chairs while surfing, then are the chair-building and surfing aspects of me disjoint? Do I want to have to say what aspect of myself is involved, in order to use those parts, if by doing so I make the complexity clearer? (And do I want to prevent myself from hammering while surfing, which will usually get me wet, perhaps with my own blood.) Finally if that element is only temporary, so I need some point of reference to find it, and it may in fact not be there, so I might have to acquire or construct it, then it is simply aggregated to me by some relationship. "I have this chair, and I can give to you. But then if I need another chair, I will have to acquire one." Only a 'pointer' or other indicator of relationship to the object is then legitimately part of my composition. The comment regarding Simula has a point. -- In computing we tried a world where these things are all ironed out cleanly, and have had to either back away from it (into the Smalltalk/Python/JavaScript/etc. alternative framings of class identity), or build huge systems (like polymorphic multiple inheritance in C++) to stretch around the boundary cases. There are worlds, like that of pure LISP, where there are really only atomic values, names and pointers; so composition and class membership are total illusions. Even in class-tolerant (but not class-centric) object-oriented languages like Python and Javascript, these concepts are emulated and not always applicable. It sometimes helps to maintain one's perspective to remember how much these latter two things are constructs, not natural occurrences, with variant models in different languages, both formal and natural, much less different problem domains, proving the basic ideas are not necessarily the same for everyone.
