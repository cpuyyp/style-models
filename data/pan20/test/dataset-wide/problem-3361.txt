(10) now has an article, namely the one that must appear in the plural of indefinite nouns and of uncountable nouns. To construe Tim Osborne's (3b) as something I would be forced to uphold is a strawman-argument. Tim Osborne's examples (4) are irrelevant because they show VP-ellipsis in English. These data do not contribute to an understanding of the German data. There are two counter-arguments against the pronoun hypothesis: 1.If einer is a pronoun, rather than an inflected article, then two scenarios are possible. A. The pronoun is morphologically exocentric. That means that the word/part of speech class of einer cannot be derived from the combination of ein, an article, and -er, or other inflectional affixes. Since -er is an inflectional suffix, it cannot cause derivation. We would have to assume 

I want to know whether there is a technical term, preferably an accepted one, for the following type of parenthesis (bold): (1) You are, I believe, not healthy. The (bold) parenthesis always consists of a subject (often a pronoun) and an illocative verb: think, believe, etc. See for Russian: Iordanskaya & Mel'čuk (2011). Personally, I'm not convinced that Iordanskaya & Mel'čuk have it right, though. The English data are less compelling than the German data. This type of construction looks as if it could be recovered in derivational syntax theories. However, data from German throw doubt on this assumption: (2) Sie würde dem, (so) glaube ich, niemals zustimmen. 'She would, I believe, never agree with that.' The parenthesis in (2) shows VS-order, with the optional adverb so. Note that the parenthesis cannot be the main clause because the propositional object (the clause without the parenthesis) cannot be preceded by a subordinator, such as dass. If you know what this construction is called, or if you should know of an analysis of this kind of structure, please post an answer. Please avoid lengthy discussions in the comment section. 

The kind of structure you ask about is known as an interlinear gloss. It consist minimally of three lines: the first line being the language being analysed, with segmentable morphemes separated out by hyphens; the second line is in the analysis language and has a gloss (usually a grammatical category label) for each morpheme in the first line and is spaced out so that each glow lines up vertically with the appropriate morpheme in the first line; finally, the third line is a free translation. This sounds complicated so here is an example to clarify: 

Regarding Australian languages, have a look at R.M.W. Dixon (2002) 'Australian Languages, their nature and development' (in the Cambridge Language Surveys series). Pp 602ff deal with stop contrasts and fricatives. It's well-known that Australian languages mostly lack phonemic fricatives, but an explanation for this has been proposed by Andy Butcher of Flinders University (as you might guess, it remains somewhat controversial). Fletcher & Butcher have an article titled 'Sound patterns of Australian languages' in an upcoming publication which covers these questions. WALS also discusses this issue, surveying the situation across the world and providing a map of the distribution of fricatives (along with some other consonants. A now dated but still useful reference on the distribution and prevalence of phonemes is Maddieson (1984) 'Patterns of Sounds', CUP. 

Regarding the vowel charts in the question, it's important to be aware that these show the phonemic vowels of the languages. When placing vowel phonemes on the quadrilateral they are typically spaced out evenly, as we see in those charts. This is especially so when the vowel systems are neatly balanced, like the ones shown. This should not be taken as a claim that these are the precise values of the vowels. All it really claims is that these are the contrasting vowels of those languages and shows how they contrast. For example: from the chart for French I can see that it has an unrounded high front vowel (represented there by /y/) and another unrounded front vowel that contrasts in being slightly lower (represented by /ø/). A trained linguist, even if they had never before heard French (another weird and exotic IE language I believe), could use these as a rough guide and probably make a fair stab at pronouncing words containing these vowels. As described in other answers to this question, locating vowels precisely on the quadrilateral requires acoustic analysis. This page contains examples of vowel quadrilaterals based on auditory judgement and ones using measurement of formant frequencies. 

L2 acquisition is studied, and there are many theories which attempt to explain how the L2 is acquired. If this question is for a class you would have to consider what the material is saying to properly answer the question. Otherwise, the basic way that L2 acquisition differs from L1 acquisition is that L2 acquisition is a generally conscious process (using metalinguistics awareness), the level of ultimate attainment will be less and less perfect as the learner ages, the L1 will influence the L2 permanently, this is known as fossilization, and the time which it will take to learn will differ from user to user unlike L1 acquisition which tends to be on a fairly fixed schedule. L2 acquisition will hypothetically be structured in such a way that starts with the individual's initial hypotheses (what the person unconsciously thinks about the task) that the L2 is structured like the L1. The L2 code (grammar) will be built from the L2 in such a way that bit by bit the rules of the L1 are modified to accommodate this new language. Simultaneously bilinguals seem to be neurologically structured like bilinguals, suggesting that two independent codes are constructed using the UG during the critical learning period (using the LAD), this does not seem to be the case for later L2 learners. For later L2 learners the L2 code seems to be relatively dependent on the L1 code. Actually, L2 acquisition from French to English is studied a lot here (Montreal). My psycholinguistics teacher studies L2 acquisition. I could ask him if I did not properly answer your question. It's important to know that like jlawler pointed out, we cannot observe the mind, we only have various (and conflicting) theories positing and predicting underlying cognitive structures and processes. 

Here are some possibilities, I guess it depends on your test of telicity. In English telicity depends to a large degree on the semantics of the arguments. rent; allow; cause; cost; guarantee; leave; owe. 

A term commonly used to refer to this process of semantic change is semantic narrowing. This, along with other types of semantic change as well as the processes involved, are discussed on WP. As pointed out in a comment, this process is also sometimes known as specialization. The opposite process is known as semantic broadening/widening or generalization. 

In attempting to answer I'll start by assuming a definition of 'aspectual coercion' as involving the use of discourse to force a reinterpretation of grammatically or lexically encoded aspect to make it match the actuality of the event being described (i.e. as per Dölling (2014). If this is accepted it would seem likely that all languages can do this to some extent, so any language which does not have grammatical tense would meet the OP's criterion. One of the classic examples is: 'Fred played the sonata for one day'. Playing a sonata is an inherently bounded event, but this is contradicted by the addition of the adverbial 'for one day'. Using Google Translate with languages which have no grammatical marking of tense I get the following (back translations seemed to confirm that they work tho it would be useful to have comments from speakers): 

This is probably an unsatisfactory answer, but in the Western Desert Language (Pama-nyungan, Australia) subjects can be represented by either an independent pronoun or by an enclitic pronoun. This clitic occurs clause-finally which, as clause order is SOV, means it's often bound to the verb, eg: 

Deep structure appears to be very real. The modern research on the topic of syntax supports this notion to such a degree that the syntactic movement of constituents is basically a truism. Some fairly revealing, though obvious interpretable, data on the topic of the essentiality of deep structure exists in many fields. One of those fields of research is that of syntactic complexity. Many experiments have demonstrated that until a syntactic constituent has found its 'original' location, the mind uses up resources 'holding on' to that constituent. Experiments will, for example, produce paradigms were an individual is presented with an apparently moved constituent early on in the sentence, and then later down the sentence place ambiguous anchor, that immediately after processing a certain word, there arises a possibility for there to be an appropriate location for the moved constituent to be located. As the sentence continues, following words disambiguate the potential 'deep location' into an incompatible location. This causes a fair amount of processing strain, and this strain is incremental as more and more 'false origins' are presented. While this doesn't exactly prove that there is a neurological 'structure', it certainly supports the hypothesis. Almost all investigation into the topic reveal very sophisticated phenomena, going from people 'perceiving' prosodic qualities which are not there in anchoring locations, to people conceptualizing the utterance in its basic-most structure. Deep structure seems to be so representative of our I-language that we will even commit ungrammatical utterances during communication to grammatical and deep structure-like sentences. Chomskyans, and many other linguists, really believe the deep structure to be the intensional (the 'actual' structure) of I-grammar, and for movement to be executed by the parser, which is a component that operates with the grammar, but isn't the grammar. I'm not sure, but I think that evidence for deep structure is even found in aphasiac studies. The way that you say to make our model of grammar consistent, is I think to mean 'to make our external analysis of grammar' consistent. That is what we call 'extensional' analysis. Most modern linguists are postulating theories concerning the 'intensional' (structural) properties of language. They're saying "that's what's actually happening in the brain". Sorry for going on so long!! Thank for reading! 

The notion of 'distinctive' sounds indicates that the discussion must be limited to phoneme inventories found in a single language. To do this we can consider the largest known inventories of contrastive (i.e. which I'm taking 'distinctive' to mean for the purposes of this answer) consonants, vowels and tonal features. Consonant inventories According to the World Atlas of Language Structures online, chapter 1 'Consonant inventories', the language with the largest known set of consonants is !Xóõ (Southern Khoisan), which has 122 consonants. My understanding is that it is not entirely clear that all the !Xóõ clicks contrast across enough environments that we can be fully satisfied with this number, so we could take instead the largest such inventory that does not include clicks; this is usually said to be Ubykh (Abkhazo-Adyghean) with around 80 consonants (not counting the consonants that only occur in onomatopoeia and loanwords). Vowel inventories WALS takes a simple approach to counting vowel inventories, only counting the vowel qualities rather than all distinctive vocalic segments. Thus they only consider the three features of height, backness and lip rounding, and ignore length contrasts, nasalisation, etc. With this approach they find the largest inventories to be around 14 vowels (German, Indo-European). If we include diphthongs and triphthongs then we have, e.g., Fering/North Frisian (Indo-European) with 22 vowels. Of course, if we move even further from the WALS approach and include secondary articulations such as nasalization, phonation, tongue root retraction, pharyngealization, etc then we could probably find much larger inventories. Tone There are a few languages thought to have up to 9 tones, e.g. the Kam language (Tai-Kadai) Largest attested segmental inventories Combining the WALS maps we can identify a small group of languages that have large inventories of both C and V. !Xóõ is the largest with Ubykh following, but several others have total C+V inventories approaching 60 or so segments:
