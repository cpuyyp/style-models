The main idea here is to get the features of the changed segment right by appealing to the markedness conventions of SPE's chapter 9. The changed segment is required to be a sonorant consonant which is homorganic to the preceding sonorant consonant, and the other features of this segment will have their unmarked values, as determined by the markedness conventions. For instance, we'll get [m] after [p] if [m] is the least marked sonorant labial consonant. 

Inflection goes inward, because the parts of a clause most central to the meaning are the most likely to be marked on the verb, those most peripheral, least likely. Declension goes downward in the grammatical structure of a sentence, because at the top of the structure we find the least oblique forms, at the bottom, the most oblique. Law Area asks further (in a comment): What do you mean by marked on the verb? 

I have seen palatal sounds described as raising the middle of the tongue, which has the effect of pulling the tongue root to the front and consequently enlarging the pharyngeal cavity. There is a nice X-ray of an [i] articulation at the back of Preliminaries to Speech Analysis by Jakobson, Fant, and Halle. And what is more or less the opposite tongue movement is used for ы -- the tongue root is retracted so as to shrink the pharyngeal cavity and, as a consequence, lowering the middle of the tongue. See the discussion of the feature "+/- advanced tongue root" in The Sound Pattern of English. This description gives a way of discussing the ы articulation that relates your own remark about associated pharyngealization and descriptions that make ы the back counterpart of [i], and parhaps also those that mention some sort of diphthong involving movement of the back of the tongue. The middle of the tongue and the root are connected, so moving one of them has consequences for the other. 

In "You call him whatever you want" the "whatever you want" is a noun phrase consisting of a relative clause -- there is no noun head. Similarly, in "What I need most is a good rest" the subject noun phrase "what I need most" is a relative clause with no head noun. However, in "No one knows what caused the accident", there is no relative clause. Instead, "what caused the accident" is an indirect question. "What caused the accident? Nobody knows." 

Why do you think any language distinguishes. Syntacticians generally use the term "conjunction" to refer to a class of constructions including both "and" and "or", because both of these work the same way, grammatically. They both connect constituents of the same type and create a new constituent of that same type. For instance, "Benny likes halibut or despises smelt" has a verb phrase, "likes halibut or despises smelt" which has two constituents of that same type conjoined by "or", the verb phrase "likes halibut" and the verb phrase "despises smelt". If we exchange "or" for "and", we get a construction of exactly the same type. 

The term "long distance dependency" is not well chosen if what is meant is "unbounded dependency", because "unbounded" and "long distance" don't mean the same. The distance between the parts of a construction can grow arbitrarily if there is an unbounded dependency, which means the distance doesn't matter. But you seem, actually, to be interested in constructions where distance does matter. So I suggest that instead of unbounded dependency constructions, you look at constructions whose parts can be separated a little ways, but not too far, by strings of words which are not part of the construction. Such cases are often described as discontinuous constituents. For instance, particle verbs in English don't like to have verb and particle separated too far. 

You've been offered a part playing an Australian stevedore, but you have to pick up the accent in just two weeks. It's only a few lines you have to get right. Concentrate on the sounds and the rhythm -- forget what the lines mean. After that, maybe there's an drunken Italian pastry chef role for you. That is to say, it's not a matter of getting rid of your old accent, but learning new ones. 

The organization of constituents into applications of functions to arguments does not intrinsically enforce binary branching, since one could have functions with more than one argument. But evidence from certain ambiguities of scope argues for application to single arguments only. When an adverb occurs with a term argument of the same obliqueness, James McCawley discovered an ambiguity: 

A definition which appeals to what is being defined is recursive. For instance, a phrase structure rule for coordination of sentences which defines an S using S in the definition, S -> S "and" S (A sentence may consist of a sentence followed by "and" followed by a sentence), is recursive. It is possible for a set of rules to be recursive, even no single one of the rules is recursive. For example the set of rules S -> NP V; NP -> "that" S is recursive, because S must be interpreted in order to give a full interpretation of S. Similarly in programming, a procedure is recursive when among the procedures which are called to complete some computation is that very procedure itself. In mathematics, a definition which appeals to the term being defined is recursive. For instance, "positive integer" can be defined as "1" or the successor of some positive integer. 

which is only marginally acceptable, since "that she was tired" is complex and is embedded in the middle of the verb phrase "said ... to John". Even before Ross's treatment, Victor Yngve in a study "A Model and an Hypothesis for Language Structure" proposed that (roughly, as I recall it) a large degree of left branching in a construction made it more difficult to process. Yngve's idea has not been popular; still, it was interesting. 

As I understand the terms, the distribution of a VP would be the X and Y in a constituent [ X VP Y ]. However, affixes associated with auxiliary verbs might count as part of the X rather than part of the VP (looking before the affix-hopping transformation, that is). The list of things you call environments seem to me rather to be descriptions of verbs or VPs. 

Here is an attempt at an SPE style rule (except that reference to the "." syllable boundary would not be allowed by SPE conventions): 

I think ff would be called a digraph because it corresponds to two letters. Wikipedia has an entry for Digraph. 

I'm not familiar with the term "C-selection". Taking categories to be NP, V, P, ..., when these categories are divided up (as they must be) into, e.g., singular and plural NPs (NPpl, NPsg), and transitive and intransitive verbs (Vtr, Vin), that is referred to as subcategorization. There is no grammatical theory, so far as I know, that provides any basis for a distinction between the two sorts of terminological splits. It's just a matter of what is convenient and what is usual and customary. In Aspects of the theory of syntax, Chomsky used the term "strict subcategorization" to refer to the subdividing of major categories like N or V, into subcategories according to what tree sisters (also with parents NP or VP, resp.) they could cooccur with, e.g. Vtr or Vin. The restriction to tree sisters was intended to have theoretical significance. 

No, anaphora is always involved in a relative clause construction, because relative clauses have relative pronouns (not necessarily explicit), and relative pronouns are anaphoric. The "which" of your example 

When human language first evolved, perhaps people had not yet discovered the notion of integer, which allows you to generalize a single way of counting things of various sorts. Consequently, each sort of thing that had to be counted was classified as a separate gender. 

Logically, "not" is a sentential adverb. Grammatically, in English, it is an auxiliary verb suffix. The disparity between its logic and its grammar explains why it is so difficult to classify, especially for those grammarians who cannot distinguish logic from grammar. A grammatical modifier is an element which when added to something of a certain grammatical category gives a new element of that same category. In logic, negation and the modal operators are treated as being added to sentences (or, that is, propositions) to create new sentences. If p is a sentence, then ~p is also a sentence. Although logicians don't use this terminology (they generally call ~, Nec, etc. "operators"), this makes negation a grammatical modifier. Grammarians generally call modifiers of nouns "adjectives" and other modifiers "adverbs", so it is reasonable (though vague) to call "not" an adverb, judging from its logic, since it modifies something other than a noun (viz., a sentence). In English grammar, though negative "never" can reasonably be classified as sentential adverb, comparable to "possibly" or "maybe", "not" itself is not at all a grammatical adverb. Instead, it is suffixed to a finite auxiliary verb like "is", "can", "does", to create a new finite auxiliary verb ("isn't", "cannot", "doesn't", and so on). 

I think it could be either one, depending on the language. I have my own peculiar theory of syllables, which is a variant of Saussure's idea that syllable structure is a paradigmatic perspective which is reflected syntagmatically, i.e. in the stream of speech, by a phonetic segmental difference between explosive consonants (whose aperture increases) and implosive consonants (whose aperture decreases). An obvious problem with Saussure's version of this theory is that aperture does not uniformly increase at the beginning of a syllable, nor uniformly decrease at the end. So my revision is to substitute stress/unstressed for Saussure's explosive/implosive. This is the SPE feature stress, which is defined for consonants (honest -- I checked), but not actually used for consonants, so far. We could identify it with the fortis/lenis difference, which is sometimes used for consonants. So then we can identify as a syllable a syllabic segment together with any preceding stressed non-syllabic segments and any following unstressed non-syllabic segments. This makes syllables phonetic, and also phonemic if there is a stressed/unstressed (fortis/lenis) distinction for consonants. C.-J Bailey once gave an interesting argument for syllables being phonemic. He observed that in some southern dialects there is a distinction between May.a, the first name of the poet Maya Angelou, and Ma.ya, the Central American Indians. I could describe this as a difference in the stress of the y: the former y is unstressed and the latter one is stressed. Unfortunately for this particular example, another plausible account is available. May.a might have the diphthong /ai/. 

There is no pronoun in D, but the low pitch and stress of "the silly little boy" tells us that it is (what has been called) a pseudo-pronoun, and refers back to Harry, as in example B. 

Perhaps it is pragmatic, in a sense, and has to do with who is responsible for identifying what Jack seeks as a woman. Consider for instance "Jack seeks a woman, although he may be mistaken about her sex," where it is I the speaker who identifies her as being a woman. When a sentence is assigned a representation that makes explicit various conversational participants (or others), that is a "performative analysis". 

In reply to a comment, here is a 2PSG example tree for the example [i] "Under the bush crouched Bill": 

I find the question and much of the discussion so far contaminated by confusions between language and writing and between word and phrase. "Frying pan" is a noun; it is a compound, made up of two words, "frying" and "pan", which are both nouns. It is not a noun phrase, though you might be able to find a noun phrase (e.g., the subject of a sentence) which just this noun occurring alone, but at the moment, no such example occurs to me. The fact that "frying pan" would customarily be spelled with a space between the two nouns that make up the compound, rather than "frying-pan" or "fryingpan", has really nothing to do with its grammatical category. Why should it? The space there is just a spelling convention, not a linguistic hypothesis. It may be part of your understanding of the term "phrase" that a phrase has more than one word. You ought to try not to carry over this understanding to grammar, because the terms "noun" and "noun phrase", as used in grammatical analysis, have nothing to do with whether a constituent has more than one word. One of the first things that has to be done in teaching modern grammar to a student who is trained in traditional grammar is to convince the student that a noun can never be the subject of sentence -- only a noun phrase can. Now, can a multi-word constituent ever be a word, as I have claimed above for "frying pan"? Yes, and the case of word compounds is one such case. There are others. Here is a pretty clear one. A general principle of coordination is that the constituent created by combining two constituents has the same grammatical category as the constituents that were combined. Combining the verb phrases "run" and "eat sardines" with "and" gives the verb phrase "run and eat sardines", for instance. Note that I've categorized "run" as a verb phrase, even though it has just one word in it. Now consider the perfectly ordinary sentence "The man and woman left". What category is "man and woman"? It has more than one word -- does that make it a phrase? No, it's just a noun, formed by the general rule of coordination mentioned above. Start with two nouns, connect them with "and", and you get something of that same category -- a noun. So, if we can agree that a noun is a word, clearly here is a case of a multi-word word. 

The indirect object is the noun phrase after "to". I am partial to the Relational Grammar account which derives the double object construction by promoting an indirect object to a direct object (and demoting the former direct object to Chomeur). 

Roy Major's thesis at Ohio State described his child's simultaneous acquisition of English (from father) and Portuguese (from mother), and he has since worked in the area of acquisition and foreign accent. His book Foreign Accent should have some interest for you (though I haven't read it). 

Context free grammar (cfg) satisfies your requirements, in a certain sense, when interpreted in a certain way. (1) Among transformational theories, it is Minimal, since it has no transformations. (2) It distinguishes X-bar types from X types in a systematic way, by (at least in my interpretation) not having X types as primitives. To be consistent with traditional grammar, it is usual in cfg to write, e.g., P-bar -> P N-bar; P -> under, ..., but this is a bad move. It should be P-bar -> under N-bar, ... If we still want to refer to traditional parts of speech, we define: (a) a head is the pronunciation part of a context free phrase structure rule (cfpsr), and (b) a P is head of a P-bar. Similarly for V (head of V-bar) and N (head of N-bar). (3) It is binary-branching, at least in the most straightforward way of doing derivations and displaying derivation trees. There is a rule of replacement, allowing a new cfpsr to be derived from two old ones: 

My first job as a graduate assistant in linguistics in 1965-66 was in Ilse Lehiste's acoustic phonetics lab at Ohio State, and for a time, I spent many hours running a Kay Sonagraph, making sonagrams (spectrograms) from taped informant sessions. I don't know how the variable bandpass filter was implemented, but you could see what was happening. The Sonagraph recorded a short sample of speech -- just a few seconds -- then replayed that over and over as the bandpass filter moved its band little by little. A strip of special coated paper was strapped on a rotating drum, and an electrode burnt a line of varying darkness, depending on the output of the bandpass filter. The electrode moved upward on the drum (or downward, I can't remember), so you would be left at the end with a time vs. frequency analysis of the sample, with dark areas on the paper corresponding to the formants. At least for men's voices, you could also see the vertical striations for individual vocal cord vibrations, and count them to estimate the voice pitch. At the time, Lehiste was investigating the acoustics of the overlong consonants of Estonian, and the rearticulations partway through the articulations of the consonants were clear on the Sonagrams as small bursts of energy (quite inaudible). 

I don't know of a standard term. I'd refer to it as mutual assimilation. The change in Sanskrit of ai to ee = e: is an example. So far as I know, there's nothing special about it, as compared with other assimilations, except that it's, well, mutual. 

In the example "The number of people who speak English as their native language will decline", "as their native language" is a manner adverb, which makes it a V-bar modifier, following the analysis in McCawley's The Syntactic Phenomena of English. The V-bar modified is "speak English". Syntacticians generally identify syntactic categories, or parts of speech, by checking out "privileges of occurrence". We compare other phrases with similar senses that could be substituted. Here, we could substitute for "as their native language" such phrases as "natively", "fluently", "in a fluent manner", and so on. This makes it evident that it is a manner adverb. For describing manner adverbs as V-bar modifiers, please see McCawley's discussion. The idea that we use "part of speech" only to classify single words and not also phrases, expressed by several other commenters, might have been true long ago, for the ancient Greeks, but is no longer so. Times change. 

I agree that your example is a reduced non-restrictive relative clause. For evidence that appositives of this sort are reduced clauses, see McCawley's discussion of appositives. However, in the clause "(who is) one of the newest members", the expression "one of the newest members" is not in a coreferential position. It predicates something of "who". The term "coreference" is ordinarily reserved for presupposed coreference, not asserted reference, as we have here. There is discussion of the difference between asserted and presupposed reference in Postal's book Crossover phenomena (1971).
