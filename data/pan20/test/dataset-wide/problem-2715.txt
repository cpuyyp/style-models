For (1) consider a Wittgenstein family resemblance type of analysis. It is pretty clear that intentional deliberate decision making is an activity that sits pretty close to the core of "intelligence", culturally transmitting acquired knowledge is another example. Automatic reflexes, e.g. jerking away from a pain, though still information processing in the general sense are not, by most people most of the time, really considered to be at the core of intelligence. Note that it is when animals exhibit behaviors indicative of these core facets that we most easily ascribe intelligence to them, when they do information processing that sits less obviously at the core, honety/bumble bee navigation comes to mind as a potential example, people are less will to ascribe these behaviors as relating to actual intelligence. Of course with this type of analysis, there is no rigorous absolute boundary (the game of love? politics as a game? etc.) but an honest assessment of which aspects of information processing in humans (the only physical things to which intelligence has been universally ascribed) are/are not the prototypical exemplars of the class will put the boundary well into multi-cellular organisms, i.e. that "intelligence" is only a (proper) subset of the use of data to advance power. Getting to question (2), beyond just a descriptive and taxonomic, function, the distinctions between intelligence and other form(s?) of information processing how we judge and address issues that arise from them. Someone knocking over your drink with an automatic reflex is a different situation (warranting different behaviors) that someone deliberately knocked over your drink. Maybe there are contexts where the most effective way to communicate your concepts to an audience is to lump all information processing together as "intelligence" to emphasize that it is all a continuum, but there also seems to be contexts where painting in such broad strokes seems to obscure rather than reveal. 

My question is very simple: Is it, as Russell seems to imply, possible for something to have no cause and why? 

I agree with you that philosophy is not a field of knowledge. This, however, does not mean that one should not attempt to seek answers to its questions - it means that, most of the time, one cannot find any one definitive answer. Typically, a philosophical question will be answered differently depending on whose philosophical ideas you find valuable and from which you are then deducing an answer. Therefore, even after receiving an "answer", one has not attained knowledge, but rather gained new insight and perspective into different ways of attempting to answer the question which assists your "endeavour and spiritual exercise". 

Decartes methods and theories were brilliant for their time. However, the assertions of a separate and detached possession we each have, which he claims is the invisible mind, has always been a major flaw in his reasoning. Daniel Dennett extrapolated the modern Cartesian model into what he calls, “Cartesian Theater’. Represented as a series of viewers, each interpreting the same instance of the singular subject viewer and providing evaluations of the same. If you take Decartes’ Methodology of mind as a skill set with which to learn and observe the world you are immersed in daily, it becomes a technology. The division of a referential self into a dualistic entity interferes with our clarity of thinking. A subjectively defined Cartesian ‘invisible self /mind’ model has been allowed to intrude on our thinking, causing many errors to how we perceive our identity. We are linguistically trained to falsely identify it as part of who we are. The Cartesian dualistic model of self is less disciplined in deliberate thought processes. It is best used as a modified technology we are able to apply to learning and investigative research. 

Depending on the details, you might classify it as involving an inappropriate "appeal to authority". 

Here's a summary experiment where a computer can predict a subject's decisions seconds before the subject is conscious of the decision. This experiment seems to make observations on the relationship between physical biological processes and the ultimate subjective, conscious, perception of "having made a decision". Usually, these experiments are done using real-time f-MRI measurements to detect brain state, and then associating different MRI data patterns with different mental states. To me, the main issue with these is in identifying the time of "conscious decision" making, to address this different labs have tried to set up different protocols to tease out the exact time of "conscious" decision making, e.g. M. Matsuhashi and M. Hallett "The timing of the conscious intention to move", European Journal of Neuroscience 2008 used the idea of when a subject was able to respond to an external stimulus to veto an action. Obligatory Wikipedia article I think that, in net, these experiments do represent progress towards understanding the relationship between brain states and mental states, and have significant philosophical implications. Note: the first linked article is a popularization, but includes a reference to the qualified scientific research. 

It is a very well known phenomena that people feel pride for the country where they were born and/or live, even though the effect seems to be declining slightly nowadays. Frequently, governments also try to instill a sense of national pride in their citizens in order to motivate them to serve the country. But is it ethically correct to be proud of one's country? When people say that they are proud of being a citizen of a country that has an independent jurisdiction, is a democracy and respects its citizens' rights, the obvious question to me is: Can you be proud of something that you did not create? 

One commonly used thread is to emphasize that ideas/information are very different sorts of things from physical goods and our treatment of these two types of things should be different on that basis. One "obvious fact" here is that: When I provide you with my physical item, (in most cases) I can no longer benefit from the use of that item. When I provide you with an idea, we both can continue to use and benefit from that idea. The fact that ideas don't have a problem of scarcity or depletion means that we should not apply the same ethical considerations to them as to physical goods. From this seed, whose core is focus on the ideas/information themselves and not on how it is transmitted, flowers more general considerations of freedom of thought and freedom of expression; two natural rights that are obvious moral goods. I've read something, I have new ideas related to that work, why should the now dead original author be able to reach out from the grave and constrain what I can say? This is the basis of libertarian arguments against copyright. 

You have substituted god for spirit. What Hegel is referring to is the fundamental ability of humans to use and modify abstractions. Mind/Giest signifies the qualities of both mind and spirit that defines most of the subjective skills we pursue and possess as humans. Religion is another form of subjective abstraction that serves a cultural need to refine mind and spirit usage to adhere to actions within limitations of practices and beliefs. The abstraction of subjective religion fits within the distinction for Mind/Giest, but not the other way around. 

"There are more colors than we can see aren't there?" Yes. It is relative to being human to be able possess the functions of being able to imagine feelings, spaces, objects, and textures, we have never experienced. There is always the experiential historic senses of color to use as the basis for the unknown color, but if you described gold as a bright shiny yellow, it would still not be gold. Whether or not an imagined color is accurate would depend on the language used to describe it. I will use short exercise I created in 2014 to describe how language creates realities we can only get to through imagination. 

The way that I could see S being consistent is by defining those cases where a prior cannot be defined from those cases where it can. Then it would only be in those latter cases where he would consider Bayesian approaches valid. This would amount to S "solving" the problem of induction by delineating those cases where (Bayesian, statistical) induction is justified from those where it is not. 

I am unaware of any animal species that has had such a wide spread and numerous population, and had such a significant impact on the environment (paving roads, building buildings, draining swamps, daming rivers, as well as what are usually thought of as "environmental impacts" of waste/sewage). There is essentially no place on Earth where you can go without finding some impact, especially trash, from humans. Arguments could be made that large scale evolutionary shifts, like 

The goal of the jurisdiction of most democratic states today is the reintegration into society of criminals. Therefore, according to modern standards, a badge of shame would not be considered successful as it would obviously oppose this goal. Of course, in some cases, a reintegration is impossible - but wouldn't it be better to lock these up all their lfie instead of letting them walk around freely? And for all others willing to improve, a badge of shame would be an inappropriate punishment lasting to their death. 

I do not agree with you that a product is abstract when in stock - most people may not care about it, but e.g. its location and possessor certainly are far from being incomprehensible. The scenario you describe would, however, arise when the products being sold have not yet been produced. In that case, one would first describe a future object, which only begins to exist at a later point in time. The future object can, by definition, only describe our knowledge of the future object and not its actual properties and will therefore not be entirely describable, which leads to the problem you are facing. To answer your initial question in a general fashion: a category (or class, in software development terms) is simply a set of properties that belongs to all of its instances (i.e. in common use — some philosophers may define it differently within their theories). In no way does this mean that its instances need to be or represent actual objects or even be conceivable by humans. That said, how to solve the problem of describing physically nonexistent and existent objects is entirely up to you. Defining one category for the kind of the product and another one for physically existent/nonexistent objects is certainly one way. You will, however, also have to take into account the design and performance limitations of your development environment — factors that will probably matter more to you in practice than philosophical concerns.
