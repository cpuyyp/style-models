The answer is yes (I am assuming here the spaces are standard and the measures are probability measures). For this kind of questions I find that it is convenient to think about quotient spaces rather then sub-$\sigma$-algebras. In particular, instead of considering the $\sigma$-algebra of invariants you better consider the space of ergodic components. Recall that given a probability measure preserving transformation $T$ on $(Y,\nu)$ there exists a space $Z$ and a measurable (a.e defined) map $\pi:Y\to Z$ such that the $\sigma$ algebra of $T$-invariants equals the pull back $\sigma$-algebra under $\pi$. Alternatively, $\pi:Y\to Z$ is characterized by: 

We consider the Bruhat-Tits building of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. As usual, we identify the vertices with lattices, that is subgroups of the of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ commensurated with the standard lattice $\Lambda_0=\mathbb{Z}_p^n$, defined up to homothety, namely multiplication by $p^k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. Getting rid of the homothety relation, we can represent each lattice uniquely as a subgroup $\Lambda$ of $\Lambda_0$ which is not contained in $p\Lambda_0$. Such a $\Lambda$ will contain $p^k\Lambda_0$ for some natural $k$, and the minimal such $k$ is said to be the distance from $\Lambda$ to $\Lambda_0$. From now on by vertex I mean a representation of homothety class of lattices given as above. Thus the set all vertices of distance $k$ from $\Lambda_0$ is given by $$ \{\Lambda\mid p^k\Lambda_0<\Lambda<\Lambda_0,~\Lambda\notin p\Lambda_0 \mbox{ and the rank of } p^k\Lambda_0/\Lambda\mbox{ is less than }n\}.$$ Dividing by $p^k\Lambda_0$, the set above is in bijection with the set of all $p$-abelian subgroups $$ \{A \mid A < (\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n,\mbox{ the ranks of } A\mbox{ and } (\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z})^n/A \mbox{ is less than }n\}.$$ Recall that every for every $p$-abelian group $A$ there exists a unique vector of natural numbers $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_m)$ with $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq \ldots\geq \lambda_m> 0$ such that $$ A\simeq \bigoplus_{i=1}^m \mathbb{Z}/p^{\lambda_i}\mathbb{Z}.$$ In that case we say that $A$ is of (isomorphism) type $\lambda$. If for all $i$ $\lambda_i=k$ we say $\lambda=k^m$. Given types $\nu$ and $\lambda$ we denote by ${\nu\choose \lambda}_p$ the number of submodules of type $\lambda$ of a given module of type $\nu$. We conclude that the number of vertices of distance $k$ is given by $\sum {k^n\choose \lambda}_p$ where the sum runs over all $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_m)$ with $\lambda_1=k$ and $m<n$. We are left with a concrete computation. Fixing $\nu$ and $\lambda$, ${\nu\choose \lambda}_p$ is a polynomial in the variable $p$ which is computed in claim 4.5(1) in $URL$ $$ {\nu\choose \lambda}_p=p^{\langle \nu'-\lambda',\lambda'\rangle}\prod_i\begin{bmatrix} \nu'_i-\lambda'_{i+1} \\ \nu'_i-\lambda'_i\end{bmatrix}_p$$ where $\nu',\lambda'$ are the transpose diagrams of $\nu,\lambda$, $\langle \nu,\lambda\rangle=\sum \nu_i\lambda_i$ and we use the notations: $$ [i]_1=1-p^{-i},~[m]_p!=\prod_{i=1}^m [i]_p,~\begin{bmatrix} n \\ m\end{bmatrix}_p =\frac{[n]_p}{[m]_p[n-m]_p}.$$ 

I would be surprised if there weren't (or are there any fundamental obstructions?). I would also be happy with metrics for weak convergence of non-negative measures (but not normed ones) or for uniformly bounded measures and would also like to know the answer to the same question for vector valued Radon measures on a metric space. 2dn edit: Thanks for the great answers. I had forgotten the general procedure to define a metric for weak(*) convergence on bounded set, but in fact I had a more "geometric" metric in mind, something in the direction of R Ws and Dans answers. 

No, you can't. Even in linear optimization with only two variables you may have several linear constraints that form a corner of your feasible domain. Removing some constraints may make the corner less sharp and lead to an unbounded objective. Imagine that removing some constraint adds new feasible directions at the corner (it's simple to draw a picture...). 

I am not aware of results on the linear rate of this variant of the proximal point method. Let me note that convergence is usually shown by the following observation: Since $C$ is a bijection, you may view the iteration $x^{k+1} = (I+CT)^{-1}x^k$ as a preconditioned proximal point method that solves the preconditioned inclusion $0\in CTx$. Define $S = CT$ and observe that $S$ is a monotone operator on the same Hilbert space but equipped with the inner product $\langle x,y\rangle_C = \langle C^{-1} x,y\rangle$ (which is the natural inner product for the preconditioned problem). Hence, you immediately get convergence of the method and a rate, but with respect to the $C$-norm $\|x\|_C = \sqrt{\langle x,y\rangle_C}$ (also called energy norm in the context of preconditioners). 

For a standard Lebesgue space $(X,\mu)$ the autmorphism group of the W* algebra $L^\infty(X,\mu)$ is the group of measure class preserving automorphisms of $(X,\mu)$ - the group of a.e defined measurable map $\sigma:X\to X$ s.t $\sigma_*\mu$ and $\mu$ are equivalent, modulo the relation of being identical a.e. (more generally: the category of standard Lebesgue spaces and (the op of) the category of commutative W* algebras with separable predual are equivalent). Apply this general fact in the case $(\mathbb{Z},\text{counting})$ and get the answer: yes, every automorphism is given by a permutation. 

Added in proof: After writing this answer and before posting I noticed that Nate Elderge already answered the OP. I decided to post my answer anyway, as it contains a "particulr easy example", as requested in the OP. So, here it is: Your argument is right. It is closely related to the Eberlin-Smulian theorem. Note that by Banach-Steinhaus every weakly converges sequence is actually bounded, so a function which is weakly sequentially continuous is exactly (a function which is weakly sequentially continuous on any ball, hence) a function which is weakly continuous on any ball. Thus, your question translates to "can one find a function which is weekly continuous on every ball but not weekly continuous". Here is an example: $$ \ell^2\to \mathbb{R},\quad (a_n)_{n=1}^\infty \mapsto -\sum_{n=1}^\infty \min\{n-\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k|^2,0\}. $$ Note that on every ball this sum is finite, hence the restricted function is continuous. However this function is not globally continuous, as one can observes using the unbounded converging net constructed in another MSE answer of Nate Elderge. 

contains "Foundations of a General Theory of Linear Integral Equations" (starting on p.55 (59 in the pdf)). This is a translation of the paper 

Yes, there is a translation, but not an official one and only of the "Erste Mitteilung", not the whole book: The pdf 

There is some (probably stupid) thing that I did not get in Serge Lang's $SL_2(\mathbf{R})$: On page 93 he considers a representation $\pi:G\to GL(H)$ of a group $G$ in a Banach space. Then he defines the subspace $H_\pi^\infty$ as $$ H_\pi^\infty = \{v\in H\ |\ x\mapsto \pi(x)v\ \text{ is }\ C^\infty \} $$ and uses this to define the derived representation. My question simply is: Since $G$ is just a group: How is differentiability of the maps $F_v: G \to H$, $F_v(x) = \pi(x)v$ defined? 

There is also the original article "The discrete Galerkin method for integral equations" by Atkinson and Bogomolny 

David Mumford, a well known algebraic geometer, is responsible for the "Mumford-Shah segmentation" model in mathematical imaging. Besides being one of the most cited papers in this area, it also sparked in immense amount of work in geometric measure theory, "special functions of bounded variations", Gamma-convergent numerical approximations and calibration and functional lifting for numerical purposes. To get a glimpse, check the book Singular Sets of Minimizers for the Mumford-Shah Functional. 

Take an odd prime $p$, let $q=p^n$ and consider $V=\mathbb{F}_q$ as a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_p$. For $G_n=(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^2$ you get $c=1/2$. 

Given $\pi:X\to Y$ as above, we may endow the space $\text{Prob}(Y)$ with the weak* topology and consider its closed subspace $Z=\cup_x \text{Prob}(\pi^{-1}(x))$ consisting of all probability measures which images in $X$ are delta measures. Identifying $\delta_x$ with $x$ we consider the map $\pi_*:Z\to X$. The disintegration of a probability measure $\mu\in\text{prob}(Y)$ is a $\pi_*(\mu)$-a.e defined measurable map $X\to Z$, $x\mapsto \mu_x$, as described in the question. One may ask whether such a map could be represented as a continuous map (and that was my initial interpenetration of the question above). The answer to this question is that in case $Y=X=[0,1]$ and $\pi:Y\to X$ is the Cantor-Lebesgue function (see $URL$ there are no local continuous sections $X\to Z$. Indeed, any such section is easily seen to be discontinuous at every diadic point of $X=[0,1]$. In particular, the disintegration function of any probability measure on $Y$ could not be represented by a continuous function. 

For some newer results: There is something known for non-convex sets, also with a convergence rate, see e.g. 

The reviewer is not d'accord with the editor's decision. This happened to me once - as author: the reviewer wrote some kind of open letter to the the editor and put me and my coauthor in the cc. Basically, the reviewer complained that the editor weighted some other (unqualified) review high enough to not accept the paper. The reviewer has ideas for further research based on the paper and thinks that a collaboration would be a very good idea. He could think about contacting the author directly but this would disclose his identity (in the case that the paper is not available as a preprint - which still happens sometimes). However, waiting until the paper would be published would be a waste of time. 

Not sure if this points in the right direction since I don't know enough context. It seems like you could in principle set $y= Ux$ and either work with the rotated variable all over the place or use "splitting", i.e. consider $y=Ux$ as a new equality constraint in your original problem. Whether one of this options is practical depends very much on the context. 

This is a connected groupoid and the isotropy group of every object is isomorphic to the Weyl group. 

I'll define the map and leave the proof that it is a diffeo to you. Assume $M$ is a Riemannian manifold and $\Gamma$ is a torsion free group that acts properly discontinuously by isometries on $M$. Get the quotient map $M\to \Gamma\backslash M$. Check that it is differentiable map between Riemannian manifolds which derivative at every point is an isometry and get an associated map $T^1M\to T^1(\Gamma\backslash M)$. Note that this map is $\Gamma$-invariant, thus factors through the orbit space $\Gamma\backslash (T^1M)$. Call the resulting map $\phi:\Gamma\backslash (T^1M)\to T^1(\Gamma\backslash M)$. 

Yes, it is true that for every continuous real linear finite dimensional representation of a connected Lie group there exists a closed orbit for the associated projective representation. To see this it is enough to assume the group is solvable (as every connected Lie group has a cocompact solvable subgroup) and the representation is irreducible and faithful. It follows that the unipotent radical of the Zariski closure is trivial, thus our group is diagonalizable and the representation is either 1 or 2-dimensional. The 1-dim case is trivial and in the 2-dim case we get that the action on the projective line is transitive. 

and googling for something that contains "strict convergence" and something like "bounded variation" or "total variation" gives a lot of hits. 

Following the suggestion of András Bátkai I post my comment as an answer: Smoothing the dual or the primal problem are quite different things: Smoothing the dual will not give you a smooth primal. However, you get a strongly convex primal by dual smoothing (as opposed to merely a strictly convex primal by Huber smoothing). Hence, it depends on what kind of regularity you are aiming at: A smoother primal or a "more convex" primal - both can be helpful algorithmically. A smooth primal allows you to use gradients instead of subgradients and in turn allows you to apply gradient methods with appropriate stopping rules and such. A strongly convex primal leads to a proximal mapping of the primal objective which is not only non-expansive but contractive which is favorable for proximal-splitting methods. Of course, you can also apply both primal and dual smoothing if you like. Moreover, note that there are numerous methods to treat nonsmooth convex minimization problems efficiently 

The answer by Misha is excellent. Let me however give a more concise and self contained answer, which the OP could use when writing his paper. First note that the statement is true for $G$ iff it is true for $\{\alpha g\mid g\in G,~\alpha\in \mathbb{R}^*\}$. Since $\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})\to \text{PGL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ is onto, it is enough to prove: $(*)$ Let $G<\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ be a subgroup such that all eigenvalues of all elements are of absolute value 1. Then $G$ is conjugated to $\text{SO}(3)$. Note that for $g\in G$ the eigenvalues are $1,\alpha,\bar{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in S^1\subset\mathbb{C}$. In particular $\text{tr}(g)=\text{tr}(g^{-1})$. It follows that $G$ is not Zariski dense. Its Zariski closure must be reductive by the irreducibility assumption, so it is contained in a conjugate of $\text{SO}(3)$ or $\text{SO}(2,1)$ - these are the irreducible reductive subgroups. We are left to contradict the second possibility. Recalling that the connected component of $\text{SO}(2,1)$ is isomorphic to $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and by passing to a finite index subgroup of $G$, let me deal now with statement $(*_2)$, the 2-dim analogue of $(*)$. I will explain why if $G<\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ satisfying the conditions above is Zariski dense then it is also dense wrt the usual topology, which will give a contradiction. Assume $G$ is Zariski dense. Find $g\in G$ of infinite order. Observe that $g$ is not unipotent. Indeed, otherwise a generic conjugate of it $h\in G$ will be another unipotent and the product of high powers $g^nh^m$ will have $\text{tr}>2$ (this becomes clear when you find a basis in which $g,h$ are represented in upper,lower triangular matrix forms). It follows that $g$ is eliptic, hence, up to a choice of basis, $g\in\text{SO}(2)$ is an irrational rotation. It folows that $\text{SO}(2)<\bar{G}$. Since $\text{SO}(2)$ is a maximal subgroup, $\bar{G}=\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. 

Probably the Fenchel inequality counts? $\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$ For a function $f:X\to\RR\cup\{\infty\}$ on a vector space $X$ and it's convex conjugate $f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x\in X}\langle x^*,x\rangle - f(x)$ there always holds that $$\langle x^*,x\rangle\leq f(x) + f^*(x^*).$$ This include Cauchy-Schwarz and Young's inequality but can sometimes be used to get more specific inequalities. 

My intuitive explanation that $TGV^2$ does lead to an equivalent norm on $BV$ is the following: You do not really have a higher derivative since setting $\psi = \phi^{(k-1)}$ shows that you really measure the pairing $\int u\psi' dx$ for $\|\psi\|_\infty\leq 1$. The "higher" derivatives are really lower derivatives: You only supremize the integral $\int u\psi' dx$ over some special bounded functions, namely ones that are themselves derivatives of bounded functions. To get more intuition about the $TGV$ seminorm I suggest to look at the proof of the estimates $c\|u\|_{BV}\leq \|u\|_1 + TGV^2(u) \leq C\|u\|_{BV}$ and check how large the constants are, on what they depend (e.g. the size or shape of the domain?) and check the actual value of the norms for special cases. There are recent papers on $TGV$ denoising in one dimension where actual minimizers are derived exactly:
