Source While Alexander is known for kick-starting Hellenization in Asia, he did not live long enough to have a significant effect. It was in fact, the people who succeeded him (Greek migrants, Intellectuals, successor kings) who were the ones that continued the process and gave a lasting effect. Migrants who came from the Greek states and settled in Asian settlements brought with them their culture and religion. Natives often assimilated into this Greek culture and often opposed it. The Greeks who came to Asia did not however stamp out the religions and cultures of the natives. In some cases they actually adopted foreign elements into their own religion. There are several examples of Greek deities who have mixed Greek/barbarian origins such as Serapis. 

So as for sources "testifying the existence of Macedonia" Yes there are plenty of sources mentioning a "Macedonia" but bear in mind that between the 7th -19th centuries, the definition of "Macedonia" had changed significantly. From a Roman province, to Byzantine Theme, to Bulgarian region, to Latin region, to Serbian region and so on.. As for sources "testifying the existence of ... Macedonian people" The best you'll get are minor references to people from the region regardless of their language or ethnicity. 

That does not mean that any of them actually sat, never mind fought, on horseback. By this time the four-horned saddle also was around and Goldsworthy maintains that, contrary to some historians, this made up for the lack of stirrups when mounting charges or doing much of anything beyond harassment or skirmishing. However he doesn't explain why the Romans, who were extremely adaptable in all other military matters, then never raised the profile of their cavalry, even when their enemies used it to increasingly devastating effect. On a purely personal note, speaking as an equestrian myself, I think he is wrong here: the difference between having stirrups or not, regardless of the type of saddle, makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of a mounted soldier. Not just in the ability of the massive charge of the armoured knight from centuries later, but in the ability to be supported when shifting or leaning sideways and a four-horn saddle can restrict turning the upper body (such as the parting shot of mounted steppe archers). Of course, in late antiquity the Roman army was largely made up of foreign troops, many of them fully mounted, anyway. In summary, the Romans apparently never made the step, during professionalisation of their military, to also centralise the raising of horses and training them and the mounted soldiers. They left it to those who could afford it, whether their nobility or their allies. Italy isn't ideal for raising horses, but other parts of the Empire certainly were - e.g. Hispania, Cappadocia (which became the main source of horses during the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire). 

You can see by the actions of Demosthenes how much of a hindrance one man under the influence of Persian gold could be. He had convinced the Athenian assembly to send an army with allied Thebans and Boeotians to meet the Macedonians at Chaeronea and be decisively beaten. This resulted in the destruction of the city of Thebes and the end to the conflict which brought most of Greece under Phillip's control. 

Engraving of the first photograph of the Parthenon. Daguerreotype photograph taken by Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière in October, 1839. Engraved by Frédéric Martens. Published in Excursions daguerriennes by Noël Paymal Lerebours in 1841. 1848 - the Mosque now does not appear: 

The article does not list a source for this information and i cant seem to find any further information about it. Is there any evidence Hagia Sophia was built on the foundations of a pagan temple? 

I found this entry on the website of the Australian National University,which tells the interesting story of Thomas Muir, a dissident we might call him today of the United Kingdom. Entry on Thomas Muir Sentenced to Transportation, he settled in Sydney. This is where the Otter arrived and he indeed planned his escape, but not only was he not a stowaway, he travelled in collusion with her captain, Ebenezer Dorr. 

So, very little actual evidence of wine-making in Britain during the Roman Empire and what little we have points to a very short abortive period. And no indication of just what wines were grown. However, indeed, wines grown in Britain around the 11th to 13th century were actually praised. A bit after the Romans though. 

My question - which apparently turned into a micro-essay - is aimed at a more root cause investigation of the eternal favourite and discussed topic of why the Romans failed to conquer "Germania" when so few other areas posed an obstacle at the peak of its might. TL;DR: Why did Rome really not conquer Germania when the reasons so often given seem to apply to other conquered areas as well? See for example Why were the Romans unable to conquer Germania? My interest was rekindled by the findings at Battle at the Harzhorn which wasn't just surprisingly far east into Germania but also at a rather late date (just before the onset of the Crisis of the Third Century). I'm interested in a comparative analysis that, for instance, compares Gallia, Germania, Dacia, Britannia - and even Judaea if needs be - in terms of geography, climate, population (density and urbanisation). For example: 

Warren Treadgold, one of the most eminent scholars on the Byzantine Empire puts it simply as follows: 

Any medieval sources that mention "Macedonians" or a "Macedonian people" are doing so in a geographic context. You could have people who spoke Slavic, Vlach, Albanian or Greek in Byzantine Macedonia that could have been described as "Macedonian". 

photo taken from this forum So my question is, when was the Mosque inside the parthenon actually demolished? Do we have a date for it? Also a bonus question, do we know if the original photo taken by Pierre-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière in October, 1839 still exists? or has that since been lost? 

Officially, If you were a Muslim in Greece, you could be exempt from compulsory deportation if you were: 

- Diplomacy and Displacement: Reconsidering the Turco-Greek Exchange of populations, 1922-1934 (Onur Yildirim, pg 249) If your identification papers read that you where Orthodox and not Muslim, you where exempt from the population exchange. Furthermore, marriage in the Orthodox church requires that both husband and wife must profess the Christian faith. Therefore those Muslim men and women who married into Orthodox families had to convert as a pre-requisite to their marriage. 

I thought I'd turn my comment into a proper answer. My main source is Adrian Goldsworthy's The Complete Roman Army, a must-read/have for anybody who's interested in that topic, IMO. Originally, as @SJuan76 linked to, cavalry in the "Polybian" (i.e. pre-Marian reforms around 100 BC) Roman army was the charge of those who could even afford the cost of a horse and its and the riders equipment. These were the equites, who formed about 300 out of a legion of 4,200. The 300 were divided into 10 turmae and each of these was led by a decurion ("leader of 10"). Unfortunately, Polybius only stated that the cavalry fought with "Hellenistic style equipment" and assumes the reader knows what that means. The estimate is that these we close order units
