This is true if $r$ is odd or $r<2d$, and false otherwise. I assume, when you say a polynomial is symmetric you mean in fact it is homogeneous. 1. Let $r=2d$ and take $P(x)=-x_1^2x_2^2\dots x_d^2$. The term $x_1^2\dots x_d^2$ appears in every $r$th power of a linear form with a nonnegative coefficient, so their sum plus monomials in $d-1$ variables cannot get a negative coefficient at $x_1^2\dots x_d^2$. A similar reasoning works for all even $r\geq 2d$. 2. Now assume that $r$ is odd or $r<2d$. In the former case we will even show that each appropriate polynomial is even a sum of $r$th powers. Firstly, notice that $$ (-1)^rr!y_1y_2\dots y_r=\sum_{I\subset\{1,\dots,r\}}(-1)^{|I|} \left(\sum_{i\in I}y_i\right)^r. $$ So the monomial $y_1\dots y_r$ is a linear combination of $r$th powers. By substitution, the same holds for every $r$th degree monomial in $x_1,\dots,x_d$. So the linear hull of all $r$th powers is the whole space of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$. Let $S^{d-1}$ be a unit sphere in $\mathbb R^d$, and let $\mu$ be the usual measure on it. If $r$ is odd, then $$ \int_{S^{d-1}}(a^Tx)^r\,d\mu(a)=0, $$ so $0$ lies in the convex hull of all the polynomials $(a^Tx)^r$. By Caratheodory's theorem, $0$ is a finite convex combination of some of them, and (due to symmetry of the sphere) each $r$th power is involved in some such combination. This yields that $0$ lies in the (relative) interior of the cone generated by $r$th powers, so this cone is the whole space. This is exactly what we claimed. (Some time ago I was told that this Caratheodory trick appeared in a paper by Milman and someone else; sorry for not presenting the exact reference.) If $r$ is even but $r<2d$, then the same integral is a nonzero polynomial $Q$, but it contains only monomials of even degree in each variable; so it is a linear combination of monomials in at most $d-1$ variables (and it is invariant under sphere rotations). Then the same arguments can be applied to the factor space by $\langle Q\rangle$. We will represent each polynomial as a sum of $r$th powers plus a multiple of $Q$, which is again what we need. 

$\def\F{{\mathbb F}}$ This is just a proof of Qiaochu's example. Let $k=\F[Y,Z]/(Y^2,YZ,Z^2)$, $a=\overline{Y}$, $b=\overline{Z}$. In the ring $k[X]$ we have $I=(aX^3-b)=\{aP(X)X^3-bP(X): P(X)\in \F[X]\}$, since $a(aX^3-b)=b(aX^3-b)=0$. So each element of this ideal contains both even and odd powers of $X$. Thus in $k[X]/I$ the element $t=\overline{X}$ is algebraic, while $t^2$ is not. 

For Question 1, it seems that the word $\dots 001001001001\,011011011011\dots$ has neither such factor. 

Here is a construction for the $2\times2\times2$ case. Perhaps, it is not unique. Choose $t<1$ such that in a triangle $XYZ$ with $XY=1$, $XZ=t^3$, $YZ=t^2$ we have $2\angle X+3\angle Y=\pi$. Such $t$ exists, since for the minimal value of $t$ (i.e. $t^2+t^3=1$) we have $2\angle X+3\angle Y=0<\pi$, while for $t=1$ we have $2\angle X+3\angle Y=5\pi/3>\pi$. Then the configuration below is what you need. On this picture, the angles equal to $\angle X$ are marked with an arc, those equal to $\angle Y$ are marked with a double arc. If a segment is marked with a roman numeral $n$, its length is $t^n$; an unmarked segment has a unit length. 2x2x2 configuration $URL$ 

$\let\eps\varepsilon$You hardly can do better. Set $a=0.9$, $b=1.1$, and take $p(z)=(z-a)^n$, $q(z)=(x-b)^n$. we have $\eps=p\bar q-q\bar p$ with some $\bar p$ and $\bar q$ of degree $n-1$ (then one may set $\hat p=p+\bar p$, $\hat q=q+\bar q$). Moreover, the first $n-1$ derivatives of $p\bar q$ at $b$ vanish, which means that $\bar q$ is simply the sum of the first $n$ terms of the Taylor expansion of $1/p$ at $b$ (multiplied by some constant), i.e. $$ \bar q(z)=\frac{c}{(b-a)^n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{n+i-1\choose i}\left(\frac{z-b}{a-b}\right)^i. $$ Checking the value at $b$, we get $c=\eps$. Finally, let us look at $\bar q(-1)$. The absolute values of terms in the corresponding sum grow pretty fast (since $\frac{1+b}{b-a}>2$), so this sum has the order of the last term, i.e. almost $\eps C^n$ for $C=\frac{4(1+b)}{(b-a)^2}$. If you need distinct roots, just perturb the roots a bit. 

EDIT Take te multiset of all edges of $\gamma$; if it contains a pair of inverse edges, remove it, and repeat this while possible. If the resulting multiset is empty, then $c(\gamma)=0$, otherwise we will find a cycle with nonzero product with $\gamma$. Now each edge appears in only one direction, the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex with respect to this multiset are equal, except for $v_0$ and $v_n$ (if they are distinct). If this multiset contains a subset which forms a cycle $C$, then $\langle \gamma, C\rangle=|C|>0$. Otherwise, let us move along the edges from $v_0$, not passing any edge twice. We either come twice to some vertex (thus finding a cycle), or finish at $v_n$. In the latter case, we have passed all the edges (otherwise the remaining ones form a cycle again).END OF EDIT Thus we may assume that $\gamma$ is simple, so $\gamma$ has the form $v_0\to v_1\to\dots\to v_n$ with $v_0,v_1,\dots,v_n$ distinct. Let $G$ be the underlying (undirected) graph of our initial graph. Let $G'$ be the subgraph of graph $G$ obtained by removing the edges (not vertices!) of $\gamma$. If the component of $v_n$ in $G'$ contains no other $v_i$, then the edge $(v_{n-1},v_n)$ is a bridge in $G$, so this edge contradicts the condition imposed on the faces. Thus there exists a path in $G'$ from $v_n$ to $v_i$ for some $i$. This path, augmented by $v_i\to v_{i+1}\to\dots\to v_n$, provides a cycle having a positive product with $\gamma$. 

Finally, put the restrictions on the neighboring $n\times n$ tiles at distance $N$ apart (meaning that the position of the second $n\times n$ square is obtained from that of the first one by the shift by $N$). That is --- prohibit some $n\times (n+N)% and $(n+N)\times n$ arrangements where the bordering complete squares are of types which cannot be neighbors in this way. (Recall here that we enumerate all translational types, so rotation of a Wang tile changes its type!) 

No, such sequence of functions does not exist, even without the local constantness hypothesis. For every $k$, choose some $n>k$ and $q_k\in U_{1/k}(q)$ such that $f_n(q_k)=1$. Then the set $K=\{q_k\colon k\in\mathbb N\}\cup\{q\}$ is compact (since $q_k\to q$), but $(f_n)$ is not eventually vanishing on $K$. 

$\let\eps\epsilon$ $\def\conv{\mathop{\rm conv}}$ A set is called $R$-strictly convex if it is an intersection of balls of radius $R$. Denote by ${\mathop{\rm conv}}_R C$ the $R$-strict convex hull of $C$, that is --- the intersection of all balls with radius $R$ that contain $C$ (we assume that the diameter of $C$ does not exceed $R$). The result you need is a consequence of the following Lemma. Let $B$ be a convex compact set of diameter $\leq D$ an Euclidean space. Then for all sufficiently large $r$ the Hausdorff distance between $B$ and ${\mathop{\rm conv}}_r B$ does not exceed $A/r$, where $A$ depends only on $D$ (it even does not depend on the dimension!). 1. Let us show that the Lemma implies the statement under the question. Consider $r$ which is a bit smaller than $\eps^{-1}$ and let $B_\eps=\conv_rC_\eps$. We claim that $C\subseteq B_\eps$ (hence by Lemma the distance between $C_\eps$ and $C$ is at most $A/r$). Actually, assume that $C\not\subseteq B_\eps$. Then $\conv_r C\neq B_\eps$, which means that $\partial \conv_r C$ contains some point $c\in C$ which is not in $B_\eps$. This point lies on the boundary of some ball of radius $r$ containing $C$; if we scale this ball at $c$ so that its raduius reaches $\eps^{-1}$ we will see that $c$ is an $\eps$-exposed point; this contradicts to the definition of $B_\eps$. 2. It remains to prove the Lemma. In fact, we show that if $d(x,B)>r-\sqrt{r^2-D^2}=D^2/2r+o(1/r)$ then $x\notin \conv_r B$. Consider the point $y\in B$ such that $d(x,B)=\|x-y\|$, and take the hyperplane $p$ passing through $y$ and perpendicular to $x-y$. Then $p$ is a supporting hyperplane for $B$; that means that $B$ is contained in the intersection of the halfspace $P$ bounded by $p$ and the ball $K$ with center $y$ and radius $D$. Now take the ball $L$ of radius $r$ whose center $o$ lies on the line defined by $x,y$ inside $P$, and whose boundary contains $\partial K\cap p$. Then $L\supset K\cap P\supset B$. On the other hand, $\|o-y\|=\sqrt{r^2-D^2}$, hence $\|o-x\|>r$, and $x\notin L$. Thus $x\notin \conv_r B$, as desired. 

$\def\Vol{\mathop{\rm Vol}}$ Take $a_1,\dots,a_n\in S$ such that $\Vol(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ attains the maximum. Now, if some $b\in S$ lies outside, say, $H_{a_n}^+$, then $\Vol(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_{n-1},b)>\Vol(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ which is impossible. Thus $b$ lies in the intersection of all such halfspaces. This works for every finite set $S$. 

Assuming the contrary, we get that the minimal value of $$ f(a,b,c,d)=ab^2(b−c)+bc^2(c−d)+cd^2(d−a)+da^2(a−b) $$ on the set $$ M=\{(a,b,c,d)\colon a,b,c,d\geq 0, a+b+c+d\leq 1, a+b+c\geq d,\dots\} $$ is negative. By the homogeneity, this value is achieved on $a+b+c+d=1$. Later we will check that $f$ is nonnegative on the boundary faces $a=0$ and $a+b+c=d$. Thus the minimum is achieved at an interior point of the face defined by $a+b+c+d=1$. By the (Karush--)Kuhn--Tucker theorem, this point satisfies the system $$ -\lambda=b^2(b-c)-cd^2+3da^2-2dab=\cdots $$ for some nonnegative $\lambda$ (the other equalities are obtained by the cyclic permutation of variables). In particular, this means that $$ b^3+3da^2\leq b^2c+cd^2+2dab, \;\dots, $$ which sums up to $$ \sum a^3+2\sum ab^2\leq \sum a^2b+2\sum abc $$ (the sums are also over four cyclic permutations). On the other hand, by AM--GM we have $$ a^3+ab^2+bc^2+bc^2\geq 4abc, \quad a^3+ab^2\geq 2a^2b. $$ Summing up all these we get the converse; thus all these inequalities should come to equalities, and hence $a=b=c=d$; but $f(a,a,a,a)=0$. A contradiction. It remains to check the inequality on the other boundary faces. If $a=0$ then the inequality looks like $bc^2(d-c)\leq cd^3$; clearly we may assume that $d\geq c$, otherwise the inequality is trivial. Since $b\leq c+d$, we have $ bc^2(d-c)\leq c^2(d^2-c^2)\leq cd\cdot d^2$, as required. Finally, if $a=b+c+d$ then we may substitute this into our function getting (here Maple was used...) the large sum with many positive terms (including $b^4+bc^3$) and only one negative term $-b^2c^2$. But it is easy to see that $b^4-b^2c^2+bc^3\geq 0$ for all nonnegative $b$ and $c$. 

Multiplication by $\sum_{g\in G}g$ annihilates any element whose sum of coefficients is zero. It remains to choose such element with support of size 3, which is possible whenever $\mathbb F\neq GF(2)$. 

In fact, the symmetric matrix with zero diagonal over $F$ with $\mathop{\rm char} F=2$ is skew symmetric. It is a standard fact that every skew symmetric (bilinear) form in some basis has matrix $\Omega$ surrounded by zeroes. Each such matrix can be easily obtained from $\Omega$ by an appropriate $X$. 

Let $1\leq i\leq m$. The probability that $B$ has no column with a unique one in the $i$th position is $(1-2^{-m})^n$. Thus the probability that $B$ has each such column is at least $1-m(1-2^{-m})^n$. If $B$ has all such columns (let their numbers be $j_1,\dots,j_m$ respectively) then one may assign very small values to $x_k$'s with $k\notin\{j_1,\dots,j_m\}$, and then determine $x_{j_i}$'s so that $Bx=c$. Thus one may take $$ f(m,n)=m(1-2^{-m})^n. $$ This is small provided that $2^m\log m=o(n)$. ADDENDUM. On the other hand, let us see that no essentially better uniform bound is possible; that is, there exist suitable columns $c$ such that the probability is not that lagre. Let $c_m>c_1+c_2+\dots+c_{m-1}$. Then a positive solution is possible only if some column in $B$ is equal to $e_m$; otherwise the sum of the first $m-1$ coordinates in $Bx$ majorizes the last one. Thus we have for this case $f(n,m)\geq (1-2^{-m})^n$ which tends to a nonzero limit as $n=2^m$ and $m\to\infty$. 

The edges of $K_{2n+1}$ can be split into $n$ Hamiltonian cycles, whose clique numbers are 2, which gives a counterexample to the initial conjecture. Moreover, these cycles can be merged into larger regular graphs without increasing of the clique number (check, e.g., the case when $2n+1$ is prime!), which provides much larger gap... 

Yes if there exists a cardinal $\gamma$ with $|\gamma|<|\kappa|<|2^\gamma|$. Just take $E=2^\gamma$. No, otherwise. Throw out all popular elements from the sets in $E$; some of these sets become identical, but each equivalence class has at most $|\kappa|$ elements, since $|2^{\mathop{\rm Pop}(\kappa)}|\leq|\kappa|$. So wou still get a family of subsets of $\kappa$ of cardinality $>|\kappa|$ without popular elements, which is impossible. 

$m=3$ is indeed the maximum, and $K_4$ is the only example for this value of $m$. Two perfect matchings form a disjoint union of cycles. If there is more than one cycle, then you may swap one of them, obtaining a third matching on the same edges. So any two of the $m$ matchings form a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume that $m\geq3$; consider a Hamiltonian cycle $v_1,\dots,v_{2n}$ formed by the first two matchings, and check how the third one looks like. If some its edge $(v_i,v_j)$ subtends an arc of odd length (i.e. if $i-j$ is odd), then we may split the vertices outside this arc into pairs, and split the cycle $v_i,\dots,v_j$ into edges including $(v_i,v_j)$, obtaining a matching intersecting the third one but not coinciding with it. This should not be possible; thus each subtended arc is even. Now take an edge $(v_i,v_j)$ subtending minimal such arc, and consider an edge $(v_{i+1},v_k)$ of the third matching (going otside this arc). Now split the cycle $v_i,v_j,v_{j+1},\dots,v_k,v_{i+1}$ into edges containing $(v_i,v_j)$, and split all the remaining vertices into edges of the Hamiltonian cycle (it is possible, according to the parity). If $2n>4$, you again get a fourth matching sharing edges with the third ones bot diferent from it. Thus $2n\leq 4$ and $m\leq 3$.
