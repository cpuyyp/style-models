If simple shooting down of a plane counts, then one thing that immediately springs to mind is the shooting down of the U-2 spy plane over Russian territory in 1960. The main point of difference is that the pilot in that incident was not part of the US military, and it was not an operation for a military service. Considering that he was former military, and was working for the US government, that's not much of a fig leaf to hide behind though. There were some rumors of other military confrontations I've heard of before. Missing subs that were said to have collided with opposing subs. There was a rumor that the KAL airliner shot down by the USSR in 1983 was being shadowed by a US military plane, and that was the true target of the missile. Its possible (even likely) all the rumors are false, but if one were true, both sides denying it would be the best way to avoid a cycle of escalation. 

Congress tried to solve the issue by creating a commission. That worked about as well as congressional commissions resolve political issues in the USA today (which is to say, not at all). An important thing to realise here is that Nast was a Republican, writing editorial cartoons for a Republican newspaper. So he would have been quite exercised about the reported violence and threats against Republican voters in the states in question. This is the same type of political violence from which we get the term "waving the bloody shirt". There isn't much dobut that terrorist paramilitary groups supporting the Democratic Party were active in those states. Hence the violent imagery with the whip and the gun. The idea behind the cartoon is both to remind the viewer of the violent implements that the Democrats were (according to him) actually using to get them into that situation, and invoking the absurdity of the idea of "compromising" with a person holding you at gunpoint. On the other hand, Nast would have been a bit more willing to overlook the apparent results of the actual votes on paper than perhaps we are today. Eventually the two parties came to an implicit agreement: Democrats acquiesced to a Republican victory, and Republicans removed all remaining Federal troops from the South. This essentially ended Reconstruction in the South. It was replaced with a system of Democratic political control backed by racist laws and terrorisim to keep African Americans from involving themselves in the area's mainstream political and social processes again. This state of affairs lasted more or less unchanged until the 1950's, and is typically referred to as Segregation, or Jim Crow. 

There is a set of social science theories termed Cultural Evolution that covers that phenomenon. The idea is that certain sizes of societies require certain kinds of organization. Thus relatively diffuse hunter-gatherer societies can get away with a good deal of egalitarianism, but as a society (or "tribe") gets larger and more densely populated, more organization is required and a more stratified society emerges. Polynesian islands are often put forth as being a natural illustration of this concept, as the origins of the natives (Polynesians) are common and well known, but each island chain is isolated enough to have developed its own local culture. By the time of the first European contacts, the smallest and least fruitful islands were the most egalitarian, while the largest and most fruitful (eg: Samoa, Hawai'i) boasted full-blown feudal-style royalty. Classic Cultural Evolution theory is a bit out of favor now, as it equated being more socially stratified with being advanced and modern and "more evolved", and was used to justify colonialism and the destruction of native cultures. But if you just take the "size to level of hierarchy" relation for what it is, the observations seem sound. 

Howard Zinn, in his A People's History of the United States, claimed to be endevoring to do something quite similar to that. If you are interested in USA history, I highly reccomend it for two reasons. The first is that many others with that same interest will be familiar with it, so you can at least hold your own in conversations. The other is that it gives the best coverage of the (typically ignored) union movement in US history that I have seen. This was arguably the defining social issue of the late 19th and early 20th century. It is tough to understand the events of this period without it, yet most other US history books practically pretend it didn't happen. I understand there is also from another author A People's History of the World, written in the same vein. 

The best and most accessible recent historical account I know of for the historical Pilate is Reza Aslan's Zealot*. Here's a portion of what he wrote near the beginning of Chapter 5 of Pilate's story after the Crucifixion of Jesus: 

Any such statement clearly seems to be ignoring several recessions. Most notably the Great Depression, during which anywhere from 15-20% of the US workforce was unemployed for an entire decade. During this time, people were quite literally starving to death for lack of work. I suspect you would have had a really tough time convincing much of anyone there was a labor shortage in 1934. 

Most likely it was a combination of the moral force of the Geneva Protocol, backed up by the MAD situation where everyone had a huge stockpile just waiting to go, that prevented any serious use of chemical warfare in WWII. IMHO any public argument Hitler presented against chemical weaponry use was most likely designed for propaganda purposes, rather than representing a heartfelt belief. 

It is probably somewhat, but not entirely coincidental. We aren't 100% sure exactly why Christmas is celebrated when it is. The leading theory is that the date of Christmas was set to match (or rather, co-opt) a pagan Winter Solstice festival. The specific festival most point to was Sol Invictus. Historians going as far back as the 12th century were reporting this theory. Sol Invictus being the Roman sun god, the timing of his festival just after the Winter Solstice (the day with the least sunlight all year), is no coincidence. Another prominent theory is that it is tied to the date of the Vernal Equinox (exactly 9 months later to be precise), which of course indirectly also ends up placing it just after the Winter Solstice. So while the date was set before the Germanics were converted, the fact that it coincides with (and perhaps helps co-opt) their own "Yule" solstice festival, isn't exactly a coincidence.
