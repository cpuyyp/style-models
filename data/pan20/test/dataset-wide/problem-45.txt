There are dual founder effects and inertia. One is intellectual. One you make foundational assumptions in your worldview and spread that meme, it is very hard for people to think outside of that box. And, ideas that build on widely shared assumption that only innovate sparingly in key respects further cement the foundational assumptions because even in the face of differences of opinion on theology, the core beliefs become consensus views of all faiths. The developed the consensus worldview is, the harder it is for religion specialists who have to learn it all and derived status from having done so to toss it all way and start over from scratch, and non-specialists have less of a vested interest in doing so. People innovate based on examples of past innovation, and if there has never been more than one religion to chose from than people are much less likely to come up with the idea of founding a new religion. One is political/sociological. One a religion is up and running in the first chiefdom-ship or the first city-state, that polity is going to have an edge in being the first to expand with a complete cultural system already in place over societies that have to innovate and develop an equally fit alternative from scratch. And, even if someone does create an alternative, the first invented will be more mature and have more kinks worked out and more ancient, so it will have an edge in the battle for converts. Once a religious worldview is in place, inertia becomes a powerful force. Absent strong intervention, people continue in the habits and customs of mind and practice that they have always had. There are compatibility issues. Why did everyone start following the religion of Microsoft, rather than arguably better alternatives? Particularly in areas like explanations of a divine world that isn't experience first hand (even more so than software which is more functional in nature), your society's fitness isn't harmed materially because you choose Brand A over Brand B. But, sharing a Brand with your neighbor (whatever that may be) may enhance your ability to avoid war with your neighbor and ally together against third parties. The more people are on your side, the more valuable your brand of religion becomes and the less valuable alternative brands become relative to it and people will willingly convert to the most valuable brand. Who Decides? For most of history, decisions about religion have been made for an entire people by the highest available sovereign leader. So, in a world with millions of people but only scores of countries, the task of conversion may involved scores of people, rather than millions of individual decisions. The notion of an individual autonomous right to decide your own religious beliefs is a decidedly modern one. Even as late as the Reformation, just five centuries ago, this was the rule. The Protestant Reformation was fought one ruler at time, not one person at a time, for the most part. The notion of an individual right to decide your religion if you aren't a king or a prince, doesn't really emerge until the Enlightenment in the 18th century (arguably, this is a natural intellectual consequence of democracy which transfers sovereignty to the common man, at least symbolically). Also, culture isn't as a general rule, severable. If a new more effective culture conquerers an old less functional one, the new one is going to convert people to its religion along with all other aspects of its culture much of the time. Who writes history? Once written histories exist, oral history keeping tends to collapse. So, whoever writes the first written history controls the remembered past and can simply cast any part of prior religions that are hard to erase from the collective memory as mythology, stories and folktales, all of which are told in the frame of fiction rather than legendary history. The worldview of the first history writers is frozen in time and ideas omitted fade away, erased from the popular consciousness in a few generations. Certainly, an important factor in the success of the religions that persist today and the failure of those that do not is that every single one of the several successful religions were fleshed out in written accounts, while many of those that are gone now were not recounted in writing. Also, since literacy generally starts limited to a narrow group of people learning as adults, and is only democratized much later, the collective action problems of building a religious consensus is reduced because only a small group of people who learned to read and write after going through the same training in the same way, and having the same status in society and daily experiences as each other, need to be convinced, not a more heterogeneous group of people. Moreover, since all literate people early on are going to be accountable to the king or prince of the land, this narrow group of literate folks will also have strong cues from their leader to assist them in developing a consensus and will have an interest in presenting a unified front in order to collectively wield power vis-a-vis their leader who needs the support of at least some of them to administer his domain. One More Point: Germ load I'd forgotten one other interesting historical correlation. Religious diversity is strongly correlated with the amount of infectious disease/parasite load in the vicinity. This is because religions frequently have different food and purity taboos. In places with high disease load, the benefits to society as a whole of having religious diversity with varied food and purity taboos in making sure that everyone isn't wiped out by some virulent contagion because not everyone participates in the vectors that are vulnerable to it due to taboos outweigh the societal benefits of religious consensus. In contrast, the lower the infectious disease/parasite load is somewhere, the less religious diversity there is because the benefits of large amounts of consensus outweigh taboo diversity. So, you are much more likely to get religious consensus in a world with a low disease load (e.g. a place with a climate like Scandinavia) than you are in a place with a high disease load (e.g. a tropical rain forest). Obviously, these patterns emerge through natural selection, rather than by conscious design. 

There is way too much backstory here. The real salient points, I think, would be that this is in the middle of the Cold War, and the aliens would probably be viewed as one more proxy that the West and the East would via to control. China, India and the Third World generally, was much less developed than it is now. Japan and S. Korea were at an early industrial stage of development decades behind the USSR and US. Islamic countries in the 1970s were at a liberal peak in favor of Western leftist market socialism or Eastern one party communism, both of which emphasized secularism, only in the late 1970s did modern Islamic fundamentalism as a political movement really come into it own. This also pretty much predates the important role that Evangelical Christianity would take in U.S. politics a few years later, and the growing belief that would solidify a decade later, that strict Soviet style communism was a failed experiment which the Soviet's would depart from radically and the Chinese would depart from incrementally. Importantly, this happened before the U.S. or the U.S.S.R. realized just how world destroying a global thermonuclear war would be. Both sides felt like a large scale nuclear war was a survivable option and weren't nearly so adverse to it as current military officials are today. Any treaty to face a common enemy would be tentative, full of skepticism, or loathe to share secrets. A lot of it would come down to the personalities of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. leaders, with everyone else following suit. Technologies from the aliens, even if just one or two were adopted piecemeal, perhaps captured, could also revolutionize key aspects of the global economy (such as the OPEC oil dominance of a petroleum economy) far before their natural time. 

You would need to go back a long way, probably about 4-5 million years. There is little debate that animals in the genus Pan, made up of one species with four subspecies of common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes of the Western, Nigeria-Cameroon, Central and Eastern varieties, in geographic order, with a substantial gap between Western chimpanzees and the continuum of the other three subspecies, with some zoologists preferring to split Eastern chimpanzees into separate Northern and Southern subspecies rather than lumping them into a single subspecies), and one species of bonobos (Pan paniscus) aka pygmy chimpanzees, are more closely related to modern humans than any other species of animals that still exist today. Common chimpanzees have 23 chromosomes, bonobos have 24 chromosomes and modern humans have 26 chromosomes, but the chromosome divisions are such that particular genes in modern humans usually have corresponding genes, sometimes on a different chromosome, in chimpanzees and bonobos. There are roughly 170,000-300,000 common chimpanzees and 30,000-50,000 bonobos alive today. The 30,000-50,000 population of each of the chimpanzee populations today is probably a pretty reasonable estimate of the total population of species ancestral to modern humans while they were confined to Africa. Lots of disasters and misfortunes (volcanos, floods, wildfires, disease outbreaks, droughts) can send a relatively geographically compact population of that size into a tailspin. Indeed, several species of hominins ancestral to us did go extinct over the last several million years. The divergence between other great apes like chimpanzees and bonobos on one hand and hominins on the other is on the order of 4 to 7 million years ago, with more recent data favoring the older date which is when the earliest hominin fossils are dated. There are several possibly ancestral and possibly sister hominin species in this tie period in Africa. The six million year old Orrorin is arguably more human-like than Australopithecus (e.g. Lucy) despite being about 3 million years earlier. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, which is about 7 million years old, has been classified variously as a common chimpanzee-human ancestor, as part of the genus Ardipithecus (which is about 4.4 million years old), and as the ancestor not of humans but of gorillas. 

Almost all sedentary communities in the Mesolithic period, for example, the Jomon people of Japan, the people who lived on the Baltic Sea coast prior to the Neolithic revolution, and the various totem pole people of the Pacific Northwest such as the Haida people, were coastal fishing communities that supplemented their seafood diets with plants gathered near a coast. Several images of such settlements are shown below: Some Jomon village images are here: [ 

Until 1870, much of Canada was part of the U.K. and not Canada (Oregon Territory, all of which was once part of the U.S., included essentially all of what is shown as "British Columbia" on the map below). 

Ketamine has very different effects at different doses. At a high dose it is an anesthetic that knocks you out and if that dose is not too high, doesn't kill you. At lower doses it can induce a trance-like state and cause hallucinations. If you put someone in an environment where being knocked out is safe, but wandering around without having full command of your faculties is dangerous (e.g. a mine field, a busy intersection, scaffolding at a construction site, in a trench on a battlefield), a low dose could be deadly, while a high dose is merely incapacitating. 

The first hominin species to leave Africa was Homo Erectus ca. 1.9 million years ago in a single migration wave. Homo Erectus is the hominin species that in terms of technological developments we associate with comic book "cave men", using stone tools and fire and clubbing big game and living in natural caves, but any clothing used was probably pretty primitive because their range extended much less further north than Neanderthals and modern humans who came along later and are derived from a common ancestor well after Homo Erectus. The effective population size of the Homo Erectus out of Africa migration wave was probably pretty modest and all manner of misadventures could have prevented them from making it out of Africa. One or two encounters with giant crocs in the Nile or sharks while trying to cross the Gate of Tears if they took that route, could probably have done them in if they weren't lucky. But, once Homo Erectus was out of Africa the window of opportunity for bipedal bear evolution pretty much closed because that ecological niche was now filled. (Honestly, a scenario with an "inferior" Homo erectus or Ardipithecus species that didn't leave Africa, and a bipedal bear species that only entered Africa ca. 50,000 years ago, might be even more interesting than one in which there is no evolution for hominins at all beyond chimpanzees, or in which later hominin species go extinct.) Your divergence date pretty much needs to be prior to Homo Erectus, or at least prior to Homo Erectus leaving Africa, as it becomes increasingly hard for Homo Erectus to go extinct at that point (although competition with humanoid bears could conceivably wipe them out), and as it probably takes at least 2-3 million years for bears to evolve from being bears to humanoid bears. Really though, the bears we have today are closer to Ardipithecus in terms of their level of humanoidness relative to the bipedal bears you imagine, so a divergence date more like 4-5 million years ago would probably be closer to the mark. During the Upper Paleolithic era (ca. 40,000 to 10,000 years ago), before farming and herding were invented, bear migrations and modern human migrations pretty closely coincided, so modern human prehistory can be a pretty reliable benchmark for prehistoric bipedal bear migrations. (The earliest archaeological evidence for modern humans out of Africa is about 130,000 years ago, but genetic evidence suggests that all non-Africans today have a common ancestor ca. 75,000 to 50,000 years ago).
