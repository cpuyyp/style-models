Could you drill a really deep well? i.e. a tube well or borehole well. You would have to develop the drilling technology from scratch. But what you know, that the locals did not, is that London sits atop an Artesian basin. Drill down through the clay strata (about 400 ft from memory) and you will hit porous chalk, out of which will gush large amounts of pure, highly calcified fossil water. Clay is soft and easy to drill. Note: The mediaevals could dig really deep wells but had to stop at whatever depth they first hit water. That will happen before you reach the chalk. You'll have to drill. Oh, and your technology will then be spread to other parts if the country where they may bring water naturally contaminated with Arsenic to the surface and poison themselves with it. You'll warn them that only water out of chalk is guaranteed safe to drink, but they won't listen. 

Well, let's suppose that a wizard has worked out a really good magical squeezing process. He's also worked out that diamond is just squeezed carbon. And with a humongous diamond in hand, what girl could possibly deny him? Unfortunately his magical squeezing spell is a lot more potent than he realizes. Instead of making a diamond he initiates carbon-carbon fusion, normally seen only in the core of very large stars and the gizzards of dragons (which use the same magic rather more successfully). 

Low tech: amatoxin found in various poisonous fungi such as the death cap amanatia phalloides and the destroying angel amanatia virosa. It takes five hours to a day before the victim becomes ill by which time the destruction of his liver and kidneys is irreversible. An unpleasantly slow death follows. It does not taste unpleasant and kills many inexperienced and unwise foragers for edible mushrooms each year. The Roman emperor Claudius was probably assassinated this way. Beats me why anyone with enemies would ever eat mushrooms. High tech: a Boron salt (non toxic) followed some hours later by a guided tour around a nuclear facility where the victim and his guide are exposed to a smallish neutron flux. Boron absorbs neutrons and violently fissions. I would guess that the result would be much like polonium poisoning. The guide would not be harmed. Or polonium. Google Alexander Litvinenko for all you need to know. This is real, not fiction. Edit I forgot maybe the nastiest of the lot. monomethyl mercury. A tiny droplet absorbed through the skin will be lethal -- after some months of suffering. (So maybe not fast enough). The assassin's biggest problem is probably avoiding poisoning himself. It soaks through much chemical protective gear as if it was not there. Edit 2. Cholera is not generally considered a poison but an infectious illness can be administered as one. It certainly causes GI upset (!) but might not be associated with a meal if the assassin can make sure nobody else gets infected (or more evilly that a lot of innocents do get infected). Given modern medical intervention it is unlikely to be fatal but certain to incapacitate. Will also trigger a major public health emergency (which may or may not fit with your plot). 

There are some mathematical stability issues which might create sensible bounds, but I'm not qualified to quantify them. In general terms there is no guarantee of long-term stable orbits in a three-body system (such as Sun, Jupiter, Earth, even if Saturn and the rest weren't there). In fact, special cases aside (notably two Lagrange points) there's a proof that there are no infinite-term stable orbits, only chaos. Be reassured that the best astronomical measurements and computer modelling show Earth's present orbit won't change drastically for the next hundred million years or so, after which time we can't say anything about it because of the errors on the observations. It's therefore not impossible that five hundred million years hence, Earth will be a frozen rock wandering the galaxy in interstellar space. (Statistically, it's more likely to stay orbiting the sun until the sun goes nova). Were you to try to model Asimov's "Nightfall" system (IIRC 4 stars and two planets in a complex dance) you'd find it was unstable on a timescale much shorter than that for the evolution of Terran life. Something would get ejected from the system into interstellar space, or would collide with another body, and so the story is highly improbable (for thermodynamical levels of improbability). One approach to simplify the N-body problem's maths is perturbation theory: treat the Earth/Moon system as tightly coupled, treat our centre of mass as bound to the Sun and perturbed by Jupiter (the biggest other perturber) on a completely different scale. My guess is that there isn't space for more than around five "levels" before chaos becomes unavoidable on a short timescale. The upper scale is set by the scale of interstellar space and the large number of suns in the galaxy. The lower one, by the weakness of the gravitational force and the fact that other influences such as solar wind and atmospheric drag become dominant for tiny objects orbiting small ones. Over to anyone with greater higher mathematical skill and knowledge than myself! 

There won't be any tides. The tidal bulge or bulges will be fixed features. Sea level will be higher in some parts of the world's and lower in others compared to how it would be without the companion planet. This will be of no interest to any inhabitants other than a few physics students. Tectonic activity might start to decline once the planet's get locked ... Over a timescale of hundreds of millions of years. Tidal drag is not the only motive force. Heat from radioactive decay and (possibly) phase changes in the planet's core also provide energy. You can make these drive tectonics if you want to. The big thing is that it's hard to see how you could get a locked pair of planets with anything like 24-hour-short days. More likely month-long days. That has major implications for weather, climate, evolution. How to survive two weeks or longer of continuous night over an entire hemisphere? 

No. Also, that unobtanium is even more dangerous to us than nuclear weapons. Please go away! The fundamental problem is human nature. Consider this. Two more or less equal nations or other large groups are competing over a resource. Do they share it equally? Or do they fight, destroy half of it, and eventually the winner claims two thirds of what is left? Unfortunately in the second scenario the leaders of the winning group will have increased their status with respect to the losing group, and that is how status is judged. In relative not absolute terms. Intellectually we try to deal with that, but our underlying animal nature does not work so rationally. Alternative to those aliens, please set up a peace authority in orbit and vaporise any heavy weaponry and any armies or similar groups engaged in aggressive hostilities. A few thousand years of ruthlessly enforced peace might improve us. Don't expect us to love you for doing this! 

I think everyone has dealt with the real world physics as we currently know it. So what about invented physics? Turn the planet into strange matter via a nuclear autocatalytic reaction. It takes a tiny bit of strange matter to start the process. More than nature has ever generated accidentally via cosmic rays etc. But not so much that it can't be done with advanced nuclear/particle tech. Or destabilise it's foundations in the 4th or higher spatial dimension. string theory says there are seven more spatial dimensions that we don't perceive because they are sort of rolled up. The theory is incomplete. They can be unrolled. The planet then rolls out of our known universe. Or have someone put the cosmic censorship theorem to the test. This says that if you try to build a time machine the universe will prevent you from succeeding. So the sun goes nova just like that. (This story has already been written but I've forgotten author and title) Or my favorite: the universe is in fact a virtual reality. Have someone find a bug in its hypervisor and try to exploit it. Even better, succeed in exploiting it, until it's too late to stop the unanticipated consequences. 

One warning about microelectronics or just about anything with very small parts (nanometers). Atomic or molecular diffusion across boundaries between different solid materials is a very slow process up here on the macro-scale, although mechanics will occasionally have to separate components that have pressure-welded themselves together. However, the rules change for the micro and change dramatically for the nano. A modern microprocessor chip is unlikely to function after 50 years in storage, regardless of how well the container lasted. After 4000 years it may not be possible to deduce anything much about the microchip at all. 

Another way is to reflect as much sunlight as possible at ground level during the day but encourage radiation at night. Cover a large expanse of desert with aluminised plastic sheet reflector material on motorised rollers. By day have them unrolled. Sunlight is reflected back up through the atmosphere. At night roll them up. The ground can then radiate into the clear sky. Overall you would be cooling the planet but there would be severe climate distortions caused by, say, making the Sahara into a snowy wasteland. You might try to distribute the mirrors but they'll work a lot less well in a place with higher cloud cover. Also they'll remove land useful for agriculture etc. Sorry just realized question was specific to Venus. It would not work there because it's git 100% cloud cover and greenhouse effect has already run away. I was thinking Earthlike planet, perhaps geo-engineering if we let greenhouse effect become critical. 

Conceptually, yes. It's unlikely, though. It could happen if a species was poised on the brink of attaining sapience ( whatever that means) and the alien influence provided a small push that started a snowball rolling and growing. Imagine, maybe, teaching a (NB social) creature to speak and to ask questions, as part of assessing it's potential. This creature escapes, or is released, and rejoins its social group. It is able to teach them some of what it has learned. If it can pass on only a fraction, in a couple of generations that group will be back where it started. But if the feedback between acquiring language and the mental modifications that go with it is positive, that group might carry on improving language skills for its own needs. This could then drive its own evolution, if linguistic ability became a positive factor in acquiring a mate or a high social standing. 

How well guarded are the powder magazines on the invaders ships? At that time in history, suicide was regarded as a sin that condemned the suicide's soul to eternal damnation. If the natives do not share this cultural conditioning a suicide attack by a single man per ship might succeed. 

You might look at Europe, for a set of countries that can and do exist in the modern world, with total area and population not dissimilar to the USA. They have mostly formed a voluntary association called the European Union (EU), but the constitution of the EU explicitly gives any state the right to leave the EU. (In contrast the USA fought a civil war to establish the opposite). My own country, the UK, is now in the process of leaving the EU. Interesting times, for sure. It'll take the next decade to find out where this leads. Anyway, I don't know enough about the USA to answer this question, but since this is worldbuilding: imagine that in a near future alternate reality, Washington DC was suddenly struck by a large meteorite (total death and destruction). There's just enough advance warning that the natural cause of this disaster is known and WW3 is not triggered, but not enough warning to get anyone in DC to safety. Not even the president. Might the states decide that since the federal government of the USA had effectively ceased to exist, it was time to decide that the country had likewise, and each state was now sovereign? If not, add whatever plot elements are needed to ensure that they do so decide. Then ask, which states would inevitably find sufficient common cause with their neighbours that they decide to join together into single bigger units? You might also dig out that copy of Heinlein's Friday which paints a picture of a near-future Balkanised North America. The interstellar travel parts of the plot are far less plausible than the alternative non-USA it portrays. One other point: "real" countries need coastlines so they can trade freely. Landlocked countries are always vulnerable to being squeezed by their neighbours, leading either to hostilities or to strong-armed mergers. Bear this in mind if you decide to draw a map of a fragmented North America. It's mostly because my country is an island, and the rest of Europe is not, that the whole Brexit thing has happened. Which other countries are feeling least happy with the EU? I'd suggest Spain, Italy and Greece. All have sea on three sides and a mountain range on the fourth. Coincidence? I don't think so. One last datum: Singapore. It's a city-state. Unlike the Vatican City or Monaco, it's a "proper" country. (Also, technically at least, an island). 

It's a little-known fact that the Chinese almost arrived at an industrial revolution (as well as a global empire) in the 15th century. And then ... a dynasty came to an end. The new emperor and the Confucian bureaucracy on which he depended for power felt threatened by new inventions and foreign influences. So they banned them! It became a capital crime to build or operate any ocean-going ships of the sort that had reached India and Africa and probably discovered America. And so China slumbered for the next few centuries while its "barbarians" advanced technologically, and was powerless when they in turn navigated around Africa and India. This may not be unique. You could argue that the Eastern Roman empire (later the Byzantine empire) failed to progress beyond the technologies of Rome for similar reasons. The Ottoman empire which succeeded it, likewise. It may be that an Industrial revolution is a rarity in the realm of alternative histories, rather than a near-inevitability, and requires some very special social conditions that were present in Protestant Europe and lacking at all earlier opportunities. The original Arab Caliphate was yet another once-vibrant civilisation whose rulers legislated it into stasis and decline. So there's my answer backed by real world history. Fear of the destabilizing effects of the new. Fear of losing power, influence, and control. 

Under hard science rules this substance cannot exist in an Earthlike environment The reason is that we know the physical properties of all the stable and long-lived radioactive atoms. We can also make fairly good preductions (within factor of 2) for hypothesised stable trans-uranium elements. What holds atoms together in a solid is that they tend to share electrons to tie themselves together. The strength of these bonds varies, but the strongest known have energies of a mere few electron-volts. Temperature is a measure of how hard the bonds between atom's are being shaken. Shake hard enough and the bonds break. Molecules decompose, solids (permanent arrangements of atoms or molecukes) yield to liquids or gases (in which the atoms or molecules are free to move with respect to each other). The strongest bonds are overcome by a temperature of a few thousand degrees. Tungsten has the highest melting point. Carbon remains solid up to a somewhat higher temperature then goes straight to being a gas. So there is nothing solid made if atoms that can survive the temperatures found near a nuclear explosion. Indeed, there is nothing solid that can survive the temperature that a mere electric arc can generate. I mentioned Earthly environment, because extreme pressures can squash atoms back together into solids. That's how the Earth can have a solid core. Extreme gravity can create nuclear matter, which dwarf stars and the surfaces of neutron stars are made of. But these phases of matter are no use because if you could remove some to a low pressure environment in a small quantities, it would explode. They are also quite ridiculously dense. Finally, if what you want Is a material that can resist a very high temperature for a longer time than most, we have quite a bit of experience with spacecraft re-entry shields and supersonic jets. The former absorb a lot of heat while vaporising, and hold together while the top surface uniformly abates. The latter use strong metals with high melting points and good heat conductivity to take heat away from where it is being generated (leading edges) to cooler parts of the structure.The design of the SR 71 "Blackbird" is now fairly well documented. If you drop hard science in favour of handwavium, Larry Niven's General Products hull is a cool one liner: a giant single molecule with bonds between atoms artificially strengthened using the power from a small nuclear reactor. But we don't have a clue how that might be accomplished, and I suspect that the laws if thermodynamics say that it's impossible. First rule of handwavium is keep it short!
