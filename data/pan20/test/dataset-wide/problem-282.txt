The simplest way to prevent leaks of sensitive information if an enemy captures a camera is to make sure that there's no sensitive information on the camera. The cameras would only be turned on when the officers are on a mission, and the memory cards would be copied to a computer somewhere and wiped after every mission. That way, enemies would only be able to capture footage recorded of things they could've seen with their own eyes that very same day. Of course there would be rules as to when the cameras would be running and when they must be turned off. There's no sense in getting anything the least bit sensitive on tape, even if you don't anticipate that footage getting stolen. As for whether to record or transmit: Depends on whether or not camera capture is more likely than transmission interception, and on how reliable the radio link is. If you can't get any signal, no sense in trying to transmit; but if you're worried about cameras with valuable footage being stolen, you don't strictly need to store anything on them at all. 

Imagine a world in which technology we would probably call "technological singularity" is possible and already happened on few places of the galaxy. By the singularity I do not mean that anything is possible, but rather that original biological species transform themselves into extremely highly intelligent computer programs with big amount of control of their environment, and they completely transcend their biological nature. The post-singularity societies might rebuild planets to giant computers or even create Matrioshka brains, since the main scarce resources are computer time and memory. It would be relatively easy for such civilization to send spaceships that would transform all solar systems in our galaxy into computers and utilize them. It would be even easy for a small splinter faction inside such civilization, unless the "official forces" actively prevent it. The motivation is simply a lot of resources and freedom to gain. My question is: Are there plausible reasons that would prevent it and keep the civilizations bound to their home star systems? If there is such, the reason should be strong and valid for all such civilizations. If nine out of ten civilizations decide not to spread, and one does, the galaxy will still be transformed. 

I think this could be a very viable solution to your laundering problems, it'll clean your clothes too. 

You could take a slightly different approach, if your Orcs are green you could make the argument that they are able to perform limited photosynthesis in their skin, eating the dirt gives them the nutrients they need to perform photosynthesis which they don't usually get from their usual diet of meat and more meat. 

A similar level of secrecy could be required by Wizards in your world, the general population fears magic so wizards go to great lengths to remain hidden and anonymous, lest they be accosted by angry mobs. In this world wizards would be outlaws that operate in secret and eliminate any other practitioners of magic that are unfortunate enough to cross their path. Apprentices are recruited to be used as a source of power as in Thorne's answer and any apprentice that lasts long enough without being killed or drained of all their power grows up enough to be able to overthrow their master and take their place. 

Representation of the torus by massive points. The torus is in fact elliptical. Then, I included a centrifugal force potential and I was looking for surface of constant potential, which would enclose the massive points and which could represent the surface of the planet. At the surface, I calculated the force field. 

One possible approach how to estimate extend of space colonization is to define costs of it and then estimate the investments the governments and organizations would be willing to pay. In an excellent analysis of starship costs on the Rocketpunk Manifesto blog, the author shows that currently, the cost of building the International Space Station is \$170 millions per metric ton, and if we are very, very optimistic, the building price of space ships could be comparable to building price of a modern airplane, approximately \$1.2 millions per metric ton. My question is: What is a reasonable estimate of building price and annual maintenance cost of a long-term working colony on a planet without breathable atmosphere, like Moon or Mars, per metric ton of the colony mass? What is a reasonably optimistic estimate how low could these prices fall once the technology is established? Do not include the transport costs, only the costs of building the colony itself. 

I am honestly surprised no one's done this one yet. The centaur is a creature from Greek myth with the head, arms, and torso of a human replacing the neck and head of a horse. Standard Anatomically Correct questions: Could a creature like that exist on Earth? How might it evolve, and what would the result of that evolution look like? While the ideal centaur would be the classic human-horse hybrid, that might be be bit too far-fetched for real-world evolutionary biology. So, for the purposes of this question, I'll consider a "centaur" to be any creature with an upright humanoid torso (with a head and arms), attached to a horizontal, ungulate-style body supported by four vertical legs. Sapience and dextrous fingers are ideal, but not required. As this is probably one of the more plausible Anatomically Correct questions (normal horses can easily carry a human rider, after all), this question essentially boils down the the following: How could a horse or other ungulate naturally evolve humanlike arms? Or, alternatively, How might a human develop a second pair of legs, with a result resembling this image [NSFW]? Could the extra legs evolve gradually, and if so, what evolutionary advantages would they give? Or, would it more likely be a freak one-off mutation? Could such a mutant be viable and produce viable offspring? Could it go on to create its own subspecies of centaur-people? Clarification: This question is primarily concerned with the evolution of centaur-like beings. All the other centaur questions that I have seen or been directed to handwave the evolution and focus on the biology. 

If this reasoning is correct, then we should expect to find all five in aliens, provided they evolved as pack animals. Depending how exactly the species looks like and how it operates, some could be stressed much more than the others. If they evolved as mostly solitary animals, they would probably completely lack pillars 2, 3 and 4. (This would be probably the reason why cats in Bobson's answer do not attach to people.) They might be betraying, paranoid, completely unwilling to follow natural leaders or simply indifferent to what others think. But they would probably still be able to feel compassion, or be disgusted. On the other hand, for example the elephant seals live in groups of one dominant male and many females. The males often fight for the females fiercely. If they would develop intelligence, their behavior would probably be very strongly based on authority and the gender inequality (and differences in general) would be probably be near to extreme. The foundations present nice tool for a worldbuilder, since you can analyze patterns of behavior more analytically - you simply decide how strong will each foundation be and then work out the details. But the results will probably not look so alien. 

I should point out that this sort of arrangement, where two planets orbit each other close enough that their atmospheres touch, may not even be remotely possible. If a moon orbits too close to its planet, the tidal forces will rip it apart. On the side closer to the planet, the material at the surface of the moon will be lifted away, because the planet's gravitational attraction is stronger than the rest of the moon's; and on the opposite side, material will be slung out into space by the centrifugal force. The point where this happens is called the moon's Roche limit, and I have no idea how it applies if the "planet" and "moon" are the same size. I also don't know what impact this arrangement would have on the planets' atmospheres. They'd certainly be much thicker between the planets and at the planets' "ends" than around the planets' middles (although the air pressure at the surface of each planet should be pretty much the same everywhere), but for all I know, the centrifugal force could sling all of the atmospheres out into space. You'd also need to watch out for that. 

Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

Any cash only business would be a great way to start. You could follow the car wash example posed by JamesD but any business you could automate would work as well. As a real world example I live above a launderette... wait I promise this is going somewhere! The launderette is un-manned and automated, people walk up to a control point, put in coins and the washing machines start. I believe my landlord owns around 20 similar outlets around the city I live in and each one requires one staff member who comes to un-lock in the morning and cleans and locks up in the evening, probably paid minimum wage or near enough for 2-3 hours a day. The cash is collected by the landlord on a weekly basis. A similar business model spread over a number of sites could easily be used to launder money into "legal" income, sure there would be set up fees but once they are paid you're pretty much set up to just get the income provided by the business alongside your laundered funds. As a rough example to estimate the viability of this: 

Image from Yongyun Hu and Jun Yang, PNAS 111 629–634 (2013), doi: 10.1073/pnas.1315215111 You can notice on this Figure from meteorological model od Hu & Yang that the substellar point is not the hottest place, thanks to the wind. The hottest places are two points just above and below it. However, if Earth got tidally locked, the Coriolis force would be almost non-existent and the most dominant feature would be air rising at substellar point and near-ground winds moving towards it. (There some videos exploring this scenario 1, 2, 3, although not the wind pattern itself.) This situation was described in Vincent's and PipperChips answers. Do not miss: The transition from wind pattern of slow rotating planets without Coriolis force and quickly rotating planets of red dwarfs is nicely illustrated in Oceaniis' post at the Forum of Speculative Evolution. Interesting source is also this post at the SpaceEngine forum. Interesting source for deeper study is also thesis of R. A. Edson.
