The brown lines are mountain ranges varying in height above sea level from 23,000 to 33,500 feet. The orange arrows show which direction the continents were moving which resulted in these mountainous crashes. (Pay particular attention to Eurasia--this will prove useful for the question.) 200 million years of erosion can bring about a lot of changes on the mountains and plateaus, just to bring it up. 60-43 million years ago--Siberian Traps Eurasia at that length of time was subject to a series of lava flows, the cracks from which the lava oozed from presented in the map below on red: 

These sorts of eruption are impressive enough on land, but in the event of someone doing some serious worldbuilding, this question puts three of the four types underwater. Type #1 has long been confirmed to happen underwater, but the oceanic differences in temperature and pressure have produced a different result called "pillow lava". 

The only problem is that even the most experienced ballerinas can't keep to the tips of their toes for long. But what if they could? The most obvious thing would be to reduce or eliminate the heel, as a large ball of bone would not be necessary if the majority of the foot is off the ground. What advantages would standing on tiptoe bring to the human species as opposed to putting the feet completely flat on the ground? 

I am talking about bamboo. Believe it or not, this overgrown grass, this panda fodder, has some neat superpowers. 

In order to make subterranean structures on the scale of both Moria and Erebor a reality, how would those four issues be addressed? 

Note that at this time, the arrangement between continents and oceans were more flexible at the end of the Cretaceous than at the end of the Permian. In this alternate scenario, instead of lava oozing off India or a comet slamming into Mexico, it is flood basalt eruptions covering an area of seven million square miles of Siberia (and maybe bits of Mongolia and China, as well) and a volume of one to four million cubic miles. Taking the quote above into consideration, would a Mesozoic-Cenozoic "Great Dying" still destroy 70% of all terrestrial and 95% of all marine species, and would biotic recovery still take ten million years? 

Despite the title parodying a line in "Home on the Range", this question focuses on the "buffalo" who is actually under the genus Bison. In OTL, the 800 breeds of cattle totaling up to 1,400,000,000 individuals are descended from a species who had been extinct for only a few short centuries--the Aurochs. But at the same time that Aurochs became the first of man's walking beefs, there was a fair diversity of a related wild cattle--the bison. Not just the American Bison (Bison bison) and the Eurasian Wisent (Bison bonasus), but also the Ancient Bison (Bison antiquus), the Longhorn (Bison latifrons) and the Steppe Bison (Bison priscus). Any one of them, in an alternate history scenario, could be a likely candidate for a good amount of beef and milk. But before I finalize this point of departure, a curiosity stands. Why did man decide to domesticate cattle belonging to Bos rather than Bison? Was it a question of geography, characteristic, or both? 

Today, most mammals have dichromatic vision, meaning that they have two color receptors. Which color depends on which species you're asking. For example, the real reason bulls charge at matadors is the way they flaunt their flags--cattle CAN see color, but red does not register. Other mammals, like dogs, have a different kind of color blindess: 

So let's say we have found an alternate Earth in an alternate universe where Earth's core makes up 42% of its volume rather than the 17% ours has. Would this larger volume of core give Earth a far stronger magnetic field? 

Let's start with the elephant in the room--traditional centaurs are portrayed as having two torsos. Why? Just...WHY? No other animal on Earth has two separate torsos in one body simply because one is good enough. My proposal is that the transition between human and horse is in the midriff. That way, we can have two separate sternums fused into one. That still raises the question as to which organs will be in which ribcage. Here is my proposal: Human 

The last time I talked about an alternate Lady Liberty, I asked for the effect of her larger size--raising the height from 150 to 503 feet. What I got was that ships from within 25 miles of New York Harbor would see her torch, which has become an actual torch, much like a lighthouse. There is one other change to this alternate Lady Liberty, and it involves her skin. Our Liberty's skin was a series of copper plates, each one 3/32nd of an inch thick--that's twice as thick as a penny. The moment she was finished in 1886, the hostile, rainy climate of New York immediately set to work the chemical weathering that would turn Liberty's glowing bronze skin into a dull green. The job was 100% done in 1920. This alternate Lady Liberty has skin consisting of bronze plates 1/4 of an inch thick. Would this make her more resistant to oxidation? Or would a bronze Lady Liberty turn green (or whatever color bronze oxidizes into) as quickly as the copper Lady Liberty? 

The last time I asked about the moon, I used a scenario where it has enlarged to a diameter of 2500 miles orbiting 200,000 miles from Earth. But what if our moon has one difference or the other? In one scenario, Earth's moon is the same size--2159 miles in diameter--but stands 200,000 miles from Earth. In another, Earth's moon is the same distance from Earth--238,900 miles--but enlarged to 2500 miles in diameter. Using either difference, would the nightscape look any different? How would tides and lunar cycles be affected? 

A planned map of a future Singapore. There are advantages to building cities underground. The temperatures are constant year-round, which make the underground preferable to dealing with merciless heat (Sahara Desert, Australian Outback) or seasonal extremes (Chicago, New York City). Still, there are many problems with underground cities. The one for this question is one word--sewerage. Beneath our feet are already thousands upon thousands of miles of tunnels for plumbing, transportation and drainage. Any idea on how to build an underground city WITHOUT dismantling the existing tunnels in the process? 

66 million years ago, a space bomb ten kilometers, or six miles, wide raced through the atmosphere at 20 kilometers per second and landed on the Gulf of Mexico at an angle of 90 degrees. The result was a crater 180 kilometers, or 110 miles, wide. In an alternate Earth, a ball of pure iron is due to slam into the Great Lakes region and create a crater 300 miles wide. What would be the needed size, speed and angle to create such a hole on Earth? 

The most famous of the three is the Great Basin Bristlecone. It grows in the highlands of Utah, Nevada and eastern California. 

The largest animals alive today--and to loom into the human imagination--are the whales, a group of mammals that had been going from skinny-dip to full-blown dive in just 53.5 million years. Due to their alien, almost non-mammalian shapes, you'd be surprised at which order they belong to. 

During the summer months, Tibet warms up like a hot brick, drawing in moisture from the Indian Ocean, and that explains why India is the wettest nation on Earth. 

Other subgenres have branched out from cyberpunk, the most notable of which being "steampunk", which is defined as... 

There is no doubt that Rome was one of the key lords of architecture. Force and weight could be distributed through the dome and arch. Concrete could ensure the building's longevity. But then, I was looking up Gothic architecture and read just how practical these ornate, decorative features actually were: 

The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa is the point where the warm, moisture-carrying Agulhas Current from the Indian Ocean collides with the cold, nutrient-carrying Benguela Current from the Atlantic. The result--an ecological hotspot, where large schools of sardine lure in whole armies of predators--whales, dolphins, sharks, seals and, yes, humans. In an alternate Africa, there is another interconnected seaway in association:
