Example 1 - Walk through the wall I can choose to walk through the wall in front of me. The result of that choice may be that I end up with a bump on my head, but the point is that I can make that choice and follow through with attempting to walk through the wall. The mind, whether casual or not, acts in an abstract manner that allows one to choose to attempt to perform physically irrational behavior. 

The Answer It seems you are trying to put the will in a box it doesn't fit in - limiting it to a choice at a particular point in time among physical actions (similar to how the compatibilists define it). The problem with this is that when the will makes a choice, it is assuming that it will endure to carry that choice out. It doesn't limit it's decision making to a particular point in time. Our mind can also think abstractly and thereby have access to non-physical possible solutions to our dilemmas. The laws of the universe, to the extent that they truly do exist, certainly limit our actions, but they do not limit our will. Now, granted, we "learn over time" and limit our own will through the normal feedback process of seeing the results of our actions and creating mental models of how the world works. So, sometimes we "imprison ourselves", but there is no requirement that we do so. Therefore, my answer is that there is no physical limitation at all on the choice/desire of the libertarian free will (though the apparent physical choices often heavily influence our choices...) If you wish to talk limitation, perhaps we need to talk about the limits of what the human mind/will are able to conceive. Edit: It is worth noting, based on the comments, that the will doesn't even have to choose to address a particular issue that is presented to it physically. For example, people that are catatonic don't respond to sense stimuli at all. In social situations, we often change the subject or outright ignore the question or statement that we don't want to address. Human beings have a huge array of issues/problems/items they are working on in life, and while most of us typically set a priority on immediate physical issues (I would guess because they are typically an impediment to the longer-range, larger-scope things we are working on), that certainly isn't true in all cases. 

Granted, not formed as a strict proof or in elegant philosophical terms - but I hope I've conveyed the basic argument well enough! 

If you want a deconstruction of anything other than #1 above it is simply Occam's Razor - what is the simplest explanation given the information we currently have, that doesn't create a higher order solution (with unseen/unknown/unknowable variables). Without some interaction with, or revelation from, other worlds/dimensions we must rule them out with this most basic rule of logic. Note, however, that Occam's razor doesn't say that other solutions are not possible, it simply says that other solutions are not the best solution without any evidence supporting them. The reason Occam's Razor is an effective deconstruction for any area that applies is that there is nothing practical that can be done with the alternatives, other than write a great movie script. Even if I am a brain in a vat - will that change the way I live? It shouldn't from a logical perspective. Not if you understand all the implications. I still have the same ability to think and interact with the universe (whether objectively real or simulated) and without any information on how to break out of the vat, my choices are no different. Given that you are where you are, what are you going to do with your life? Even "ending your life" isn't a solution. Whoever is in control of you and the vat can just restart the simulation and plug you back in, or reincarnate you, or bring you to the next phase of the simulation - i.e. heaven/hell or whatever the afterlife is... 

Humans can behave irrationally Irrational behavior by definition does not have constraints Behavior follows from willed choices 

Point 1: Counter-Factual Actualization Regarding possible worlds and CF actualization: both your question and Geirsson and Losonsky are assuming that all CFs are actualizable. In other words, there is an assumption in the argument against Plantinga that there is at least one possible world where all CF possibilities could actually occur. Consider Plantinga's example of Curley and whether or not he will accept the bribe: Plantinga is stating that a weakly actualized world in which Curley is presented with the same opportunity to accept the bribe will result in Curley always accepting the bribe. That is the free will choice that he makes, as a morally free agent. He calculates the moral situation and chooses wrong. Presented with the same circumstances and the same ability to freely choose between good and evil in this particular situation, he will always choose evil and accept the bribe. Free will doesn't mean we can willy-nilly choose a random action from among those that are available. It simply makes us the agent that does the choosing between the right and the wrong way without compulsion to choose one or the other by circumstance or God forcing our hand. It doesn't mean that given the same circumstances in another possible world that we would choose differently! If we did, that would make us a different person - a different moral actor. While there is a possible CF action where Curley does not accept the bribe, Plantinga's argument relies on the fact that Curley, given the same circumstance, will always accept the bribe - his will/nature does not and won't change unless his free will is destroyed through strong actualization. Edit: Plantinga's word for this is "Essence". Curley's Essence leads him to make the free will choice of always accepting the bribe in that circumstance. "Essence" is distinguished from "Person" as explained here: Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense Therefore, while there is a possible CF action, there is not a realizable CF action. The only way of obtaining a possible world where Curley does not accept the bribe, according to Plantinga's argument, is for God to strongly actualize a world with the circumstance's changed in a way which removes Curley's freedom of action to the point that God has, in reality, removed Curley's free moral choice, his free will. God must either not allow him to choose by removing the circumstance so there is no choice, or God must directly force him to choose differently. The long and the short of it is, that according to Plantinga's argument, there is no possible world where Curley both has free moral agency, and does not take the bribe, due to Curley's nature. Now, there are plenty of people other then Curley, who put in the same circumstance, will not take the bribe. So there are possible worlds where we can find a person with free will who will not take the bribe - I will address this in the second point, but for the first point, we are only dealing with Curley, and his free will choice, given Plantinga's example, is that with the circumstances placed before him, his free will choice is to take the bribe. No CFs exist that can be actualized in another possible world for Curley, in particular, where he does not take the bribe, without God changing the circumstances in a way that does violence to his free will choice. In order to find a possible world where Curley does not take the bribe, you must remove his free moral agency - you must change his nature, his will, so that he no longer desires the same outcome from the situation. Such a possible world does not exist while keeping his free will intact. The only other option is for God to not create Curley. For than, see point 2. 

I am reading a book on productivity. "Getting Results the Agile Way" (J.D. Meier) is the specific book, but substitute your favorite "pop psychology" book on anything from productivity to parenting to how to pick a career, etc. It occurred to me that such a work might not fit well into a philosophical system, but on the other hand, there is an underlying assumption that advice on how to make good choices in a practical sense is the very essence of passing on wisdom, which is the core of what philosophy as a word derives from. 

If I'm understanding the question correctly, the answer is mainly statistical in nature, perhaps under-girded by a few fundamental presuppositions involving the universe being constrained by logic, assumptions of key self-evident mathematical laws, the constancy of natural laws, etc. These, in turn, are based, in part, on our own observations and those of our fellow humans over both our lives and recorded history, causing us to believe they are true based on the aforementioned core statistical response (I'm running primarily under an empirical lens here...). Primarily, this is a statistical and multi-variable math problem. There are two major questions we want to answer while testing a hypothesis with properly formulated scientific tests (repeatable, falsifiable, etc.) 

Scope: Whether the user's actions are determined within the broader system that the user exists in is a completely separate question. A free action is defined from the perspective of the deterministic system (or causal chain) under investigation only. Random Actions: A random action may or may not be free, depending on whether it is defined/required/constrained to work in a random manner by the system itself. I think of most random effects as pseudo-determined or statistically determined. Detectability: It may be impossible to detect and/or prove what actions are free from the perspective of an actor within the system in question. 

Yes. One can consciously hold contradictory beliefs. Because of faith - an inner sense/belief that another principle is at work which is bigger than the immediate/apparent one. Here are some statements from some theoretical authors upon being confronted with their preface paradox: Author #1: 

The weak, soft or "man on the street" form Russell Bertrand does equivocate between agnosticism and atheism, stating that he would tell a philosopher that he is an agnostic, while telling a "man on the street" that he was an atheist, as discussed here. 

The strong, hard and/or philosophical form Bertrand seems to imply there is a more philosophical form of the term(s), or at least one which a philosopher will understand, while a "man on the street" will not. By this he must imply that a philosopher would naturally put an agnostic in the atheism camp, and he is first an atheist, believing there is not a God, and secondarily, agnostic, in that in some sense he is either open to further evidence, or simply believes on an epistemological level that it is not possible to prove the non-existence of God. I consider the strong form of agnosticism to go even a step beyond Russell's position. A "strong form" agnostic doesn't make a final decision on whether God exists or not. They believe that there is not enough evidence to prove the case either way (pro or con). T.H. Huxley's position is described this way in Atheism and Agnosticism (Standford Encyclopdia of Philosophy) 

I'll take a whack at my own question here, based on the comments and additional resources folks have pointed out. 

Edit: To be clear concerning your 3rd question on whether there is a problem for physicalists, I believe the answer is clearly no. Constraints of any kind can be hard constraints on the actions one can take. Given whatever possible actions remain, the compalibilist would say the action taken is based on current motivation. At the very least I can choose to struggle or not struggle in any situation - even if that is just to maintain consciousness, etc. Edit 2: To be even more clear, even if I have no physical choices (i.e. my physical movement is 100% constrained), I still have complete freedom of thoughts in my mind, and freedom of effort to attempt to overcome the physical constraints (even if I am completely unsuccessful). Free will involves the will, not the body - I don't necessarily need to have a physical outcome to have different efforts or thoughts. On the other hand, in this final question you ask how we can otherwise define free will - to that I will answer that I don't believe the compatibilist version of free will is really free will at all. That one always follows one motivations is just a fancy way of dodging the question. You can agree to this as either a dualist or a physicalist or just about any other epistemological viewpoint. Compatibilism is more of a clarification about how the mind and actions are connected than a definition of free will, without even defining the source of the mind or anything else really pressing in the free will debate.
