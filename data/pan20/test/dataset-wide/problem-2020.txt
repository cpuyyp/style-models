I'd let it go.. your team's work has been acknowledged and recognized by the PO and that's what counts. Making a stink about it not being presented on a slide during the presentation just comes across as petty points-scoring over the other delivery manager. 

you don't have a job history, which unless you are applying for entry level roles only will be a significant disadvantage that your job history is so bad that you need to hide it (and they will almost have to assume that it is the worst they can imagine) that you were too lazy or incompetent to apply correctly for the job (unless otherwise specified a CV including at least relevant job history is pretty much a standard thing to include) 

I wouldn't, while there's a chance that it would just be appreciated as a nice gesture (and the cakes/brownies enthusiastically devoured) it would be unlikely to sway the hiring decision in your favor by any appreciable margin, and would you really want to work for someone who hired you for a non-culinary role based on your baking skills? Worst case would be that they would view it as light form of bribery (which would be hard to dispute) and make a moral judgement against you as a result. 

I'd say at this point you're okay to give your academic elements a decent amount of focus on the resume - you're on the cusp though, much beyond 18 months and it would start to ring warning bells for me. I wouldn't hide what you are currently doing though. It's real world work experience and even if not in the exact area that you are looking for it's still immensely valuable for it's "real" nature. 

Snow's excellent answer covers the main aspects of this but one detail that I spotted in the question is 

Honestly I don't think there is a "right" answer to that, rather I think it's the wrong area to focus on. As I said earlier the important thing is the quality of the presentation so I would make sure that you pick the subject you think you can give the best presentation on. Good luck! 

Ultimately it's something you have to decide for yourself and both options have downsides - you just need to work out which downsides are easier for you to live with. Good luck! 

Generally you want to avoid expressing out and out preferences for this sort of thing in a CV but instead make obvious that the company will get the best results by giving you what you want, you're on this lines already but due to the language barrier it doesn't flow quite right. I'd put it something like this: 

The main body of my answer is in response to the sort of work that was originally talked about (doing things for the side business), these latest examples are an altogether different proposition as you are doing things for your employer and learning as you go. In this sort of scenario I'd suggest it is most likely fine - I'd suggest checking in with your manager as a courtesy, especially since they might be able to give you direction on the sorts of things that would be most useful. But I'd be surprised if they had a real problem with it. The answer regarding things for the eBay business or any other possible commercial venture (even if there is two-birds - one stone situation) is still an emphatic don't do this. 

Try to avoid mentioning preferences or "feelings" - instead you're much better off positioning it as a benefit to the company to focus you more on backend work, hence my use of the term "stronger". 

By saying you'd like the number to increase for next year rather than this one you are showing a willingness to be "reasonable" which may incline them to do likewise. 

Keep any discussions in general terms - it wouldn't be appropriate to get into specifics surrounding other individuals Avoid discussing any topics or situtations where there is a conflict of interest. Even if the engineer is trustworthy and you don't believe they would give you "advice" that would unduly benefit them this perception could easily form within other members of the team and once such a perception (or one of favoritism etc) forms you'll never get rid of it. As much as possible keep this discreet - not only do you want to avoid the perceptions I mention above but you don't want to give the impression to your reports that you lack confidence or ability to lead. Avoid any situation where you are essentially using this person to make decisions for you - not only will it not actually teach you anything but you'll probably piss them off (they chose to get out of managment remember!) and it's fundamentally unprofessional to basically get someone else to do the job that you are employed to do. Keep this to a minimal level - this person was hired as an engineer not as a leadership coach, if you start disrupting their ability to do their actual job your bosses are unlikely to be pleased. Picking their brains a couple of times a month is one thing - asking for discussions about this every other day would be an entirely different story. As much as is possible you want to make sure they really are okay with doing it - there can be a natural sense of unspoken pressure to agree to requests from those higher up the ladder so try and make it clear that it's OK if they don't want to help you and that there will be no negative consequences if they decline the request. 

And any of these will more than likely lead to the application being rejected out of hand - I just can't see any way that it will create a positive impression on the potential employer. As others have said have said your cover letter is the best vehicle for mitigating the appearance of job hopping (and Patricia Shanahan's answer provided some really good language for that). As you say for a designer the quality of their portfolio can provide a good sense of the work the candidate can produce and if a potential employer feels the same way about it that you do and you address the job hopping in the cover letter then hopefully the combination of those will encourage them to give you an interview where you can reassure them that you aren't intending to leave them quite so quickly. 

If I'm hiring someone for a developer role the small spelling mistakes in code on a technical test (which is presumably time constrained in some fashion) would barely be something I'd notice. If the job required substantial document writing or written contact with external parties (customers, suppliers etc) then I would assume that they would use a spellcheck as appropriate so I believe you are overthinking this. Presumably this is something you are very aware of given your diagnosis. What feedback you have is the 7/9 score, which on the face of it looks pretty damn good so focus on the good feedback you actually have rather than worrying about the bad things they haven't even said. You don't mention where you are located and obviously local legislation will vary but certainly in the UK dyslexia is a recognized disability and I would make a new employer aware of it, ideally before it had the chance to become an issue. Perhaps not at interview unless there was a natural opening - it can make a great example of overcoming challenges in your work life or they may ask you for any disabilities you have but some potential employers may (unfairly in my opinion) view it as some kind of "I'm disabled so if you don't employ me I'll sue!!" gambit. But I'd definitely let them know when on-boarding. This helps both you and the employer as they can give you the appropriate support and ensure that anything you are writing for external consumption can be proof read if required. 

Personally I find the whole notion of bringing the family in to the office for a visit deeply weird. I mean having them drop by for a specific purpose (such as meeting for lunch, or dropping something off to you) I get but specifically visiting the work place and having a tour? Sorry I just don't get that at all. I think most people understand that some times personal and professional lives cross over but there still have to be boundaries.
