(1) and (2) are perfectly compatible, to the extent which (1) makes sense. $\mathbb{R}P^k$ is naturally a CW complex with one cell in each dimension, and $\mathbb{R}P^{k-2}$ is a subcomplex. Assuming that the inclusions are in the standard way, the difference $\mathbb{R}P^k \setminus \mathbb{R}P^{k-2}$ is not a union of open cells (of dimensions $k-1$ and $k$, but is not a CW complex. (Every CW complex must have at least one 0-cell, for instance.) Think about the case $S^{k-2} \subset S^k$ as an easier-to-visualize example: the difference $S^k \setminus S^{k-2}$ is homotopy equivalent to a circle, regardless of how large $k$ gets. 

Edit: For those interested, here are the 108 possibilities for $N=9$. I hope there's some way of checking what these are more efficiently than just going through them by hand.

Question. Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus $> 1$. Can $\pi_1(S)$ act faithfully and minimally on a simplicial tree of finite valence? Here "minimal" means that there is no invariant sub-tree. Things I know related to this: a minimal action on an $\mathbb{R}$-tree $T$ (like a simplicial tree) gives a canonical measured foliation $F$ on $S$, and a measured foliation in turn gives an action on an $\mathbb{R}$-tree $T_F$, with a surjective equivariant map $T_F \to T$. For simplicial trees, the measured foliation will come by taking a finite collection of simple closed curves and expanding them to make a measured foliation. The resulting tree $T_F$ is then an infinite-valence simplial tree, on which $\pi_1(S)$ acts faithfully. So the question is basically whether you can fold that infinite-valence tree to get a finite-valence tree on which the action is still faithful. Another point of view is to look at the resulting graph of groups (from Bass-Serre theory). But the edge groups cannot be cyclic (Skora proved this), and it's not clear to me how to proceed from this point. Richard K. Skora, Splittings of surfaces, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 9 (1996), no. 2, 605--616. 

For $1 \le p \le q \le \infty$, I need an inequality bounding the $\ell_q$ norm from above by the $\ell_p$ norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$: finding a $\lambda$ so that $$ \Vert v \Vert_q \le \lambda \Vert v \Vert_p $$ for all $v$ in a polyhedral cone in the first quadrant. It's easy to see that $\lambda=1$ works without the restriction on $v$ (and is realized by a vector that is zero in all but one place), but that's not good enough for my applications. The polyhedral cone I'm interested in is well inside the interior of the quadrant. I initially hoped that the maximal value of the ratio $\Vert v\Vert_q/\Vert v\Vert_p$ would be achieved at the vertices of the polyhedral cone, but that is not true when $p > 1$. (If it were true, that estimate would have been good enough for my applications.) What features of the cone should I be looking at? My apologies if this question has well-known answers. 

For the first question, the answer is yes. Geometrization implies that the only non-Haken manifolds irreducible manifolds are compact hyperbolic manifolds (with no cusps), and there again $\pi_1$ is residually finite. For the second part, I'm not aware of other arguments, and I think this is still the standard way to prove this. Geometrization just says that the argument works in all cases. 

First off, the mapping class group of a surface with boundary is generally taken to mean the group of diffeomorphisms that fix the boundary, up to isotopies fixing the boundary. In this context, a Dehn twist around one boundary component is not isotopic to the identity. What you're describing is usually called the mapping class group of a surface with punctures. Under many definitions (including Casson and Bleiler's) the identity automorphism is also reducible (as well as periodic). So I don't see a counterexample in what you write. If you're asking, for which simple closed curves is the Dehn twist around that curve not the identity (and also not periodic), the answer is simple: it's those curves that do not surround a single puncture. These are the same as the curves that are homotopic to a geodesic in any hyperbolic representative with cusps at the punctures. (For most curves, you look at a shortest representative in its homotopy class and you automatically get a geodesic. For a curve that surrounds a puncture, there is no shortest representative: you can make the curve arbitrarily short by pushing it out the cusp.) 

Andy Manion has already plugged our answer for Heegaard Floer homology. On the Seiberg-Witten side, not as much is known, but Tim Nguyen's thesis starts to attack the problem. However, there isn't as yet a complete answer on the Seiberg-Witten side. (Of course the two theories for closed 3-manifolds are now known to be isomorphic, but this doesn't actually help as much as you'd like. In particular, the isomorphism is not known to be natural, and not known to be compatible with the 4-manifold invariants.) 

Lots of good answers above, but the one that seems to be missing is what belongs in the third column for unspecialized HOMFLY. (As Geordie Williamson points out, Khovanov and Rozansky wrote two related papers, one of which does the unspecialized case.) There's a one parameter family of categories that looks like the category of representations of a Lie superalgebra, called $gl(\alpha)$. When $\alpha$ is an integer, you can kill off the representations that have dimension 0 and get the usual category of representations of $gl(n)$. (You can also kill off fewer representations and get the representations of $gl(n+k|k)$ for any $k$.) Many people have written about this, but perhaps the coolest place to look is in Deligne's La série exceptionelle de groupes de Lie, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Série I 322 (1996) 321—326, where he also conjectures a similar structure specializing to all the exceptional groups. (There are also several follow-up papers.) 

(There ought to be another proof of the $\text{co-NP}$ result using normal surface theory and the notion of hierarchies. Ian Agol sketched that some time ago, but the details are difficult.) The class $\text{NP} \cap \text{co-NP}$ is relatively small, and this gives reasons to believe that detecting the unknot is in $\text{P}$. (I would have made this a comment, but I think it's too long for that.) 

I'm surprised no one has mentioned Freedman's Theorem from 1982 yet. Technically this theoerem says that Casson handles are standard, but more broadly this completes the classification of topological 4-manifolds, and is one of two major theorems going in to the proof of the existence of exotic 4-manifolds. (The other half is Donaldson's work on gauge theories. That half has been somewhat simplified with the introduction of Seiberg-Witten theory.) I have never attempted to read his proof, but it at least has a reputation for being hard. 

Given a surface $\Sigma$ with conformal structure $\omega$, the extremal length of a homotopy class $\gamma$ of curves in $\Sigma$ is defined to be $$ \sup_{g \in \omega} \frac{\ell_g(\gamma)^2}{A_g(\Sigma)} $$ where $\ell_g(\gamma)$ is the (minimum) length of $\gamma$ in the metric $g$, $A_g(\Sigma)$ is the area of $\Sigma$ with respect to $g$, and the supremum runs over all metrics for which the area is finite. This is, of course, very well-studied. The definition extends without problem to cases when $\gamma$ is a homotopy class of graphs instead; that is, you are given an auxiliary graph $\Gamma$, and a homotopy class $\gamma$ of embeddings of $\Gamma$ in $\Sigma$. A natural generalization is to allow weighted graphs, where the edges of $\Gamma$ come with a weight $w(e)$. This weight is used in the definition of the length: for $C \in \gamma$, $$ \ell_g(C) = \sum_{e\text{ edge of }\Gamma} w(e) \ell_g(e). $$ (You then take the infimum over elements in the homotopy class, as usual.) You can also extend this to homotopy classes relative to portions of the boundary. Is it possible to give concrete metrics that realize the extremal length, as in the classical case of curves? For instance, in his book Conformal Invariants, Ahlfors essentially answers the question for tripod graphs embedded in the disk. That is, take the unit disk, and divide its boundary into three arcs. Let $\gamma$ be the class of tripods embedded in the disk with one leg in each of the three arcs. Then the metric realizing the extremal length with respect to this class turns out to be an equilateral triangle. Have other examples been worked out? For instance, Maxime Fortier-Bourque and I worked out the case of weighted tripods, which turn out to be Euclidean triangles of other shapes (always acute or right triangles). Here's one concrete question: suppose you look at a disk with the boundary divided into four segments, and look at embeddings of an "H" graph with one end in each of the segments. What's the metric that realizes the extremal length? There is one parameter in this problem (the modulus of 4 points on the boundary of a disk). For the symmetric case (realized, eg, by a square), the answer is a rhombus with angles 60-120-60-120. But what is the answer in general? 

Suppose you are given a 3-ball $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is bounded by a PL sphere, a triangulation $T$ of $B$ by Euclidean tetrahedra. Is that triangulation necessarily shellable? I know that if $T$ can be lifted to a convex hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^4$, then it is shellable; this applies if $T$ comes from a Delaunay triangulation. But I believe most triangulations are not liftable. I suspect the answer is "no", that $T$ is not necessarily shellable. The first obstruction I found was the existence of a knotted arc made out of two edges of the triangulation; this obviously cannot happen for triangulations of the kind that I described.
