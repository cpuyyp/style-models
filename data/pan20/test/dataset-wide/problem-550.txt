There are many factors to consider. Without being able to be scientific about it, people do evolve a natural pedal technique and I don't see the point in trying to radically change it, rather you should first have your bike fit and set up performed properly, and then allow your own natural style to evolve. There have been major cycling champions that were toe down, heel down and neutral in the way they pedalled. Neither is right or wrong, provided the bike fit is good to start with. My local bike fit specialist has written about it, and it's worth a read. Lots of art in the subject, some science. $URL$ Consider your own circumstances and individual issues, and don't forget that cleat placement has several degrees of freedom (fore/aft, inner/outer Q factor, rotational, height above pedal axle, as well as amount of pedal float) and each plays a role in how you adapt, as well as the shoes, cranks and pedal system you use. Of course saddle height and placement impacts these things as well well. 

@blam No, I don't acknowledge spinning is 2x. Any rim mass added/removed only matters 2x during changes in kinetic energy, i.e. during accelerations only, and not for the vast majority of riding we do, which is mostly steady state or involves such low rates of acceleration that the difference in energy demand is completely negligible. Don't forget that any extra rotational kinetic energy a heavier rim possesses also means the wheel doesn't decelerate as quickly either, meaning one can coast a little more. Claiming wheel mass matters 2x is misleading, because, well, it doesn't. The 2x only applies when accelerating and only to mass added at the outer rim edge, and we get some of that energy back when decelerating. During the vast majority of time we are riding we are not accelerating, or the changes in speed happen so slowly (even when racing) that the difference in energy demand is miniscule. 

About the best you can do is to set a some limits to an FTP estimate. If the Strava data was not the actual power meter data, then as Criggie says the short answer is no, you can't rely on that at all. As an aside I thought that files uploaded to Strava that had power data defaulted to showing the real power meter data rather than an estimate. If it is the actual power meter data, then you can probably at least narrow down a lower limit for FTP (provided of course the power meter is of a reasonable standard and you have used installed and used it correctly, e.g. ensuring a torque zero was performed before the race). As Rider_X mentioned above - the first lower limit will be the average power for the whole race (~1.5 hours), so your FTP will be higher than 230W (assuming the data is from the power meter and not a Strava estimate). The next lower limit will be your average power for about an hour, which in this case is ~250W. If you have some analytics software such as WKO4 or Golden Cheetah, then it can work out for you what the peak 1-hour Normalized Power was. That will be closer to FTP than average power. Peak 1-hour NP may still be lower or higher than FTP depending on how hard the race was but it will not typically be higher by any more than 5%. So if the race wasn't that hard, then peak 1-hour NP is not going to help you much except to bump up the lower limit of your estimate from the 250W average power value. However, if the race was hard then your FTP will likely be somewhere between 95%-100% of your 1-hour maximal Normalized Power. That then will at least give you an estimate to use until you have better data to improve your FTP estimate. In the meantime just collect your data and learn to use the meter correctly - it can be helpful later on the be able to assess the nature of the training you currently do as you begin to learn what changes to make to your routine. Here's an old but still popular post of mine about ways to estimate your FTP. Number 5 on the list is using the Critical Power model, which can be augmented nowadays by use intelligent of the newer power-duration models (of which CP is an example): $URL$ 

I suspect that the drop off in performance with altitude might occur a little more sharply for many than is suggested here. Nevertheless, the same principles apply even if your personal response to altitude is on the lower end of the range, and it is hard to imagine why anyone would suggest that heading to at least a moderate altitude track is a bad idea from a performance perspective. If you want to read some more, I cover these issues in three blogs items here: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

There are of course a whole range of other factors to consider with trainers (cost, robustness, ease of use, service and support, portability, size, weight, stability, noise, compatibility with your bikes, use with online and other software training aids etc etc) so I'm just talking about those relating to the nature of the resistance and ride feel. To measure power output consistently though, you'd really need a good power meter. If you do have a good power meter, then of course the need for day to day consistency of the trainer power curve lessens somewhat as you'll have a better means to assess actual load. Even so, good ride feel is important and may make a difference to the power you are able to sustain. If you have a reasonably predictable resistance trainer, then it will suffice for the purpose of assessing larger changes in fitness, but as fitness gains become more marginal (they do eventually), then the error in measurement means this method will no longer be suitable, and you'd need a better means of tracking fitness changes if that was important to you. I can't specifically comment on individual trainers, but there are definitely trainers that are far more predictable in their resistance than others and also provide for a realistic ride feel. Examples of good trainers I am aware of include the Kurt Kinetic Road Machine and the old Lemond Revolution but there are no doubt others. Of course the training you do doesn't need to be so precise wrt intensity, as being at the right overall level matters far more than being at a precise wattage. Finally, while some trainer resistance curves are more linear and others are more curvilinear, I suspect that over narrow wattage bands, the curvature is not so high as to enable greater precision beyond those error factors I've mentioned. 

The result of a 7W (3%) benefit to the lead rider of having a rider immediately behind is in line with previous experimental results and published studies. So while the effect is small, and would be difficult to feel while riding, it is a real effect, at least in low wind conditions. The side by side ride result showing an additional power demand of 10W (5%) in low yaw conditions is more novel, and has interesting implications for team formation events (e.g. team pursuit and team time trial) and rider changeovers. Of course different rider morphologies, individual aerodynamic properties, riding alignment configurations and wind conditions will yield different results to this impromptu experiment, but I thought it interesting none the less. 

Be careful with overinflation, as while rolling resistance drops with increasing pressure, there comes a point when further increasing tyre pressure begins to dramatically increase rolling resistance. Often this is around the point of the tyre's maximum rated pressure, although it can be less than that depending on a few factors. Here is an article that discusses some of the physics of tyres and demonstrates a methodology to assess where the sweet spot for lowest rolling resistance is: $URL$ Tyres that are overinflated become more skittish when cornering, and are more likely to slip in wet road surface cornering. Also many modern carbon rims have maximum pressure ratings that can be less than the tyres themselves, so be careful with that. In general, it's better to be a little under inflated than over inflated. 

There is also an inverse correlation between fatality rates and cycling participation rates - which does imply that the more cyclists there are, the safer it is. One would presume that more cyclists means the infrastructure is cycling friendly and conducive to greater participation and that other road users are far more attuned to cyclists and cycling (far more likely to be a cyclist themselves). 

As for what wheel to choose, well that's such a complex combination of factors, hard to provide a simple answer. I outlined some of the considerations when weighing up choices in my blog post I linked to in an earlier comment on this thread: They involve a range of factors, including, inter alia (and not in any particular order): 

The rate of climbing a hill on a bicycle (under same wind conditions) is determined by pretty simple physics and is directly related to your sustainable power to weight ratio. If the climb is very gentle, then your aerodynamics will also play a role. To go significantly faster up a given climb you need to increase the power output you can sustain for the duration of the climb and/or to reduce the amount of mass you are moving up the hill. At 2.4km long, it will be a dominantly aerobic effort, and if a gentle grade a maximal aerobic effort. e.g at 3.5W/kg a 2% gradient climb will take about 5-minutes but a 6% climb will take about 9 minutes. So depending on the sort of time it takes for you to climb, it'll be most likely you'll benefit from working to increase both your threshold power (FTP) and your maximal aerobic power (MAP). Improving your FTP and your MAP is a function of all the training you do and not any one session. While climbing a hill is helpful in acclimating to the specific demands, it's not absolutely necessary in order to improve the power you can sustain while climbing. What matters is the sum of all the training you do and that it is geared towards improving your ability to sustain higher power output over durations of relevance. If you wanted to include workouts that are specifically designed to increase your aerobic capabilities for these sorts of durations, then hard aerobic efforts on your indoor trainer would be just fine. For example 4-6 x 5-min efforts with 5-min recoveries would be an example of one sort of session to include once a week for about 6 weeks. They are very hard though and suitable only for those in good health and some training experience. But as I said, one workout does not an improvement in power output make - it needs to be complemented with a suitable overall training structure designed to improve your aerobic fitness. Reducing the mass you move up a hill is a combination of losing any non power producing mass, i.e. excess body fat, and perhaps a little by reducing the weight of the equipment, clothing and accessories. For most people though, the greatest gains are through losing excess body fat. This is primarily managed through modifications to your diet - and a little by the amount of total exercise you do.
