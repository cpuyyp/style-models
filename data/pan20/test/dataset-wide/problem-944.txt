The ERA Interim reanalysis is made by ECMWF and the other reanalysis is made by NOAA. Reanalyzes of the past are made by running global climate models and these differ because NOAA and ECMWF use different models and perhaps even slightly different data. The models on the other hand can be very different for example on implementation of data assimilation, parametrization and even grid cell size. All of these variables are vertically integrated. The ERA variables in the order you mention them contain: -Total column water: all water -Total column rain water: all liquid and solid water in droplets large enough not to be considered cloud droplets (my guess) -Total column water vapor: all gas phase water -Total column cloud liquid water: all liquid cloud water The NOAA variables: -Cloud water content: all liquid and solid cloud water -Precipitable water content corresponds to Total column water From these the Total column water vapor corresponds the Vertically integrated specific moisture. None of these is the divergence of the total column water vapor phase that you need. Although the paper you are referring approximates precipitation from moisture divergence, you could use just the Total column rain water and no approximation is needed (I didn't read the paper so I don't know if this is makes sense). Edit, added sources: The ERA variable list can be found here and you can search variables there and press them to get the definitions too. For NOAA I couldn't find a source for the definitions of these variables. If someone finds please edit this answer 

Please add more to this community post. Also previous posts can be edited f.e. if some attribute is in all websites it is probably unnecessary to mention. 

Well without reading the article pointed because it costs/ no rights: warmer sea surface temperatures SST links usually with more precipitation via enhanced evaporation. But in some cases like the predicted decline in precipitation in eastern Mediterranean because of climate change happens even though warmer temperatures increase evaporation. This is simply because the changes in the intensity of average storms and changes in their storm track. The case in here seems to be similar by looking at the plotted precipitation pattern. The distribution of rain changes so that more water rains in southern India and so less water can rain in the northern parts of India. And I would guess that the total amount of precipitation has still risen. 

The mean is probably the average cloud cover in percentages: 41% cloud coverage on average over time. The categories you mentioned: 'clear', 'scattered', 'broken' and 'overcast' are defined in different ways sometimes. Basically there is a human observing the sky analyzing the coverage in oktas or tenths (e.g. 6/8), or more likely there is a sounding device looking through the sky and getting a value in percentages of the cloud cover (e.g. 75.0%). To get one of these categories from the device data, the percentages are turned into oktas or tenths. Some data is lost in this transformation and thus from the categorized data it is impossible to get calculate the actual mean. Some use more the oktas (World Meteorological Organization) and others (I would guess often USA) tenths in the categorization. Also after quick googling the categorization bins seem to be differ from source to source at least for the ones who use tenths. The clear and overcast bins are for all the same less than 1/8 or 1/10 and more than 7/8 or 9/10 respectively. Obscured also always means basically that the value is undetermined: perhaps there is fog and the device doesn't get the responses it would've wanted. Some have also a category 'few', but since it was not present in the data they have used a categorization that doesn't include it. Based on all above I would guess the categorization is the same as in this webpage. Categories are clear: less than 1/10, scattered: 1/10 to 5/10, broken: 6/10 to 9/10 and overcast: over 9/10. As the tabulated values are historical they give a climatological average of what are the possibilities of different cloud cover scenarios. I would suspect that clear and scattered scenarios are good enough for watching an eclipse so e.g. in Salem you would have a 32.2 + 19 = 51.2 percent chance to have a decent or better viewing conditions. 

From physics standpoint I would say that such system is stable. For example think of a ball on a surface. If the ball is initially on the top of a hill a push would move the ball into the slope that would only accelerate it further from the original location/state (unstable system). If the ball is instead initially in a pit or local minimum, any push would move the ball to the slope only to turn back towards its original location (stable system). 

The only physically measurable difference between rain from seeded clouds and unseeded is in the seeds/ cloud condensation nuclei/ aerosols that are the surface that moisture can condensate onto and form cloud droplets. Measurements You could collect rainwater, evaporate it and the remaining solids were the substances acting as cloud condensation nuclei. This process would get some aerosols from the ambient air, but simultaneously using a device for collecting aerosols and reducing their composition from the rainwater one would lessen this problem. After analyzing the solids one could do some guesswork whether the aerosols were natural or influenced by humans. For example if there is actually deliberate cloud seeding happening you could find traces of silver iodide. Most likely this is not the case and simply heavy pollution has a significant impact on formation of aerosols that can act as cloud condensation nuclei. In this case there are probably some compounds that can be formed only in combustion processes and finding them would mean that they played a role on the formation of the clouds. Doing this experiment in otherwise similar locations with the other having much more pollution would probably be the sanest option. Even after all this you still wouldn't be able to accurately tell whether it would've rained more or less without the pollution. If the air is clean to begin with, adding pollution and thus aerosols the cloud formation would be enhanced and probably then rain too. But if the air already has enough cloud condensation nuclei to begin with then adding aerosols might have the opposite effect; moisture would condense into many small droplets rather a few big ones that create rain. Modelling Another possibility would be to study this using a weather model with aerosol dynamics included using measurements of the given location to verify the results. And when the model simulates the reality accurately enough you could tamper with the aerosol fields (by adding and reducing aerosols) and see how the rain is affected. I'm not aware how accurate these kind of models are currently, but aerosol dynamics can make the model easily very heavy. 

I think when determining the dominant or prevailing wind direction it is mainly used to describe a longer term than a day (perhaps a month, a year or the climatology in that spot). In my opinion the prevailing wind in the sense you challenge it might be a bit subjective to the one who is assessing it or coding it from a time series. By looking at a wind rose (a figure for example in here), that has the wind speeds and directions as a function of occurrence in the radial scale, you could interpret that the prevailing wind could be to the direction that has the most occurrence or another person might say that it is the other maximum that is slightly wider but not that sharp and could even have stronger winds. For example from continuous wind data lets say for wind direction resolution 0.5 degrees there might be a lone spike that has the most occurrence, but judging by the eye another maximum is much wider and clearer. Most wind roses for readability the wind directions are even binned (south, south-east..) that flattens the lone spikes. To conclude: different people may interpret the data differently when dealing with borderline cases. 

The total consumption of crude oil according to this site is around 100 000 000 barrels per day and is in SI units 10 000 000 cubic meters. Of course not all of that can be processed to gasoline, but the scale of things is revealed. That would be actually bigger than a football stadium's volume a day as it would effectively be a cube with all sides around 215 meters. 

After given some information about the data source I have a simple answer. Since the underscores SW etc. represent the four pixels around the city center and all the pixels cover the same physical area, taking a mean of the values will represent the average NDVI of the total area. It is all about what you will do with the NDVI data. E.g. if something interesting occurs when somewhere near the center vegetation amounts are low (high), then the minimum (maximum) of these might provide you with more useful predictor. 

The sea level will rise uniformly due to thermal expansion of the seas, but you are right that glaciers make things more complex. Basically when a massive glacier melts its gravitational pull is redistributed in the ocean. For example if all of the antarctic ice would melt sea levels would rise everywhere, but with a largest rise in the north pole and smallest in the south. There is also currently rising of the earths crust in areas that were pushed down by the last ice age glaciers. Therefore where the current glaciers melt away earth will gradually be rising. When earth is rising at the ocean floor it forces the water to flow uniformly to everywhere else. Also changes in weather systems change the prevailing winds that affect where water will pack, but this effect is much smaller in the long run. Unfortunately all the predicting maps I found, like this interactive one geology.com, don't take into account these factors. Some articles for more info: Ocean Portal, Yale. 

Try VentuSky. An interactive map with different models and data visualization that can be adjusted easily. 

What websites are there providing visual weather data? The question actually contains the past and future weather. The purpose is for this question is to provide a list of easy-to-access websites that give a weather enthusiast/researcher overview of the weather at a given time. Please list what models the website uses and other describing information. Ps. I think this should be a community wiki question and answer so that the list can be updated. So feel free to edit this question too. 

As the question was changed, my answer attempts to evaluate only the difference between burning and transporting. Please correct my values if my quickly found sources are inaccurate or you find more representing. I know there is quite a few unwritten assumptions that simplify this problem. 

They do have an effect, but it is minuscule. If rays are absorbed by solar panels then the energy is eventually turned into heat that is released to the atmosphere as hotter air or longwave radiation by the surface. But the main mechanism is the effect in albedo of the surface. As solar panels are dark they usually reflect less light than the background they are installed on. The total area of solar panels is so low that the effect is very very small. 

There are two ways carbon is released from soil. The first is cellular respiration of plants that uses previously stored energy (visualized in this chart). The second is when heterotrophs consume organic carbon below ground and respire carbon dioxide. The sum of these is called soil respiration, which I think was the process you were asking about. 

Now we can write an equation out of this and solve for the kilometer distance that produces equal amount of carbon dioxide equivalent.$$\frac{2170\frac{CO_{2}eq.}{kg}}{161.8\frac{CO_2}{short-ton-mile} \cdot 0.0011\frac{short-ton}{kg} \cdot 0.6213\frac{mile}{km}} \approx 20000 km$$ This is quite a large number in my opinion. I would've expected less. So quite a long distance is needed until transporting produces more $CO_2$ pollution than burning. 

I don't know if someone has conducted statistical research on this. It certainly depends on the situation. Here are some situations: More snow in coast 

Currently the climate models do model climate oscillations. For example the the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summary on the changes of El Niño based on climate model runs says (AR5, Section 14.4):
