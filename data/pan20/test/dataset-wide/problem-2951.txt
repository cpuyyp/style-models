Perhaps the details don't matter. We aspire to be realists if we form our views based on what is real even if we make mistakes about what is real. There are those who would say that both corporeal and mental events are not real, however, the Buddhists for instance, in which case most realists are fantasists. 

Your question appears to be motivated by a pessimistic view of philosophy whereby it produces no reliable results, leaving us to invent a thousand unworkable and unprovable theories and choose between them as if philosophy is a matter of opinion. This is the price of a modern university education. It's not a necessary approach but a system for protecting bad ideas and rejecting unappealing ones. Your impression that it may not be a good idea to enrol as a philosophy student seems spot on to me. But don't dismiss philosophy as a path to knowledge just because some are unable or reluctant to follow it. Only bad workmen blame their tools. . . 

This is a very important question. It brings us face to face with the incoherence of our folk-psychological ideas of space and time. My interpretation of the problem of points is as evidence that extension is not truly real. As a metaphysically-real phenomenon it is paradoxical in the ways you (and others) suggest. Only as a reducible phenomenon can extension make sense. Kant, Zeno, McTaggert and many others have discussed this issue and you'll notice that those who do discuss it often have 'mystical' leanings since only in mysticism is extension said to be a product of Mind, not a purely objective real thing 'out there'. Thomas Danzig puts the problem in terms of reconciling the staccato of mathematical extension (time and space as a series of points) and the legato of experienced time (time and space as a continuum). It cannot be done if we endorse naive realism or materialism, as the question implies. It seems obvious that there is no such thing as a point, and that no amount of them would be enough to build a piano. 

Does this autonomy/agency aspect of a program really make it possible to distinguish intelligent AI from "just software"? 

On Agency, Autonomy and AI Nice question. I believe there is no answer to it since it is a matter of definition. . Those who have hopes for AI tend to use the word to describe complicated software, and if they're a bit fussy they restrict the term to software that can 'learn', not that a computer ever knows it's learned anything. 

Great question! To solve metaphysics is to construct a global theory that solves all metaphysical problems at the level of principles. This theory will be a formal axiomatic system, resting on an axiom-set from which the remainder of the theory may be derived. The theory will predict the answer to all metaphysical questions. There is no such theory in Western thought. The only known theory that meets the specification is the neutral or 'non-dual' metaphysical scheme of the Perennial philosophy. The implications of such a theory for society may be observed from societies where this metaphysical theory is endorsed and known. The Buddhist sangha would be a case study. But in our society the effects are unknowable since almost everybody rejects this theory and so ends up utterly confused by metaphysics. This is deliberate policy instituted by the philosophy department and is drilled into students over generations, so few people have a clue that metaphysics was solved and explained long ago. Metaphysics is actually quite easy to solve at the level of principles or, at least, it is easy to find a workable solution, but as it would imply the truth of the non-dual doctrine of the mystics most people prefer to look the other way. Indeed, one entire tradition of philosophy chooses to look the other way, preferring to argue that metaphysics is intractable and incomprehensible and being content to merely add footnotes to Plato. This is Kant's 'arena for mock fights'. The consequence is a metaphysics that is impossibly complicated, incomprehensible and which groans under the weight of centuries of ineffective sophistry. The question deserves a much longer answer but I'll stop before settling into 'rant' mode. The state of metaphysics in the West is truly pathetic and a damning indictment of the scholarship and insight of its practitioners. The current 'Blackwell Guide to Metaphysics' begins with a preface that carefully explains that metaphysics is a complete waste of time, thus the whole of philosophy, and so it is if we do it the way our university professors do it. Perhaps over time forums such as this will break the hold of the professors and allow philosophy to move on. Meanwhile we go on studying people like Wittgenstein, Russell, Carnap, Ayer, Plato, Democritus and long list of other thinkers who would happily admit they did not understand metaphysics. In short, metaphysics can be solved and if this was taught to students the effect on our society would be transformative. I happen to believe that better teaching of metaphysics would be one way to 'save the world' so significant would the effect of this knowledge be on our shared belief system. But first we'll have to wait for one of Kuhn's generational paradigm shifts. 

It seems a good question to me and I would answer in the affirmative. But the idea needs tweaks. The word 'before' for the BB is okay in ontology (prior, or 'reducible to') but cannot be given a temporal meaning. What emerges from the practices of Yoga is the very idea you put forward, that the source of consciousness is prior to the space-time world thus prior to the BB. This Source would be free of phenomenal attributes (cf. Kant's thing-in-itself), thus it would be incorrect to call it Something or Nothing. This would be an explanation for why it makes no sense that our Origin is Something or Nothing, as philosophers have always found. The view you are asking about is probably 'non-dualism', which is the rejection of all positive metaphysical theories and which some would call the 'perennial' philosophy. If this is your speculation then you have a lot of support for it. To turn it from speculation to knowledge would be no easy task, however, so the case for it usually best argued in metaphysics, where the idea that the world begins with Something or Nothing is famously unworkable. 

I feel that this is an issue best addressed by analysis of the question. The phrase 'intuitive intellect' may be an oxymoron. When people speak of intuitive knowledge they usually mean 'knowledge by identity' and not the results of intellectual activity. Thus they speak of 'non-intuitive immediate knowledge'. Where knowledge is produced by intellectual activity then it may be incorrect activity (there's many a slip 'tween cup and lip) and so it can only ever be provisional or contingent. Aristotle concludes that true knowledge entails an identity of knower and known precisely because intellectual activity is never fully trustworthy or in complete contact with the reality being intellectualised. The idea of knowledge that is 'not broken into pieces' is discussed by the physicist Paul Davies in his popular book 'Mind of God'. He concludes on grounds of logic that if it is possible then it must be by way of the practices of the mystics, who seek to go beyond the intellect to realise the unity of consciousness. Where the intellect is informed by a realisation of unity this would be a profound state associated with with the phenomenon of 'nonduality' and also with what in esoteric Christianity is called 'Christ-consciousness'. Only at this level would knowledge cease to be fragmented by our language and concepts, and it could be attained only by becoming what we are, in other words by means other than the intellect. For progress we would need to define the phrase 'intuitive intellect' very carefully, and I suspect that there's no way to do it that makes much sense. 

You are talking about a difficult topic that deserves a lot more thought. The reason why existential truths are beyond words is that Reality outruns the categories of thought. Kant saw this. Bradley explains it in his metaphyscial essay Appearance and Reality. Zen koans are designed to achieve certain effects, one being a recognition that all intellection depends on the use of contradictory and complementary categories. Reality would be a Unity, however, and so these categories must be abandoned for a decription of it. Thus 'Tao that is eternal cannot be spoken' and 'True words seem paradoxical'. Bradley writes that the use of predication in metaphysical language is necessary but illegitimate. It would be illegitimate because Reality outruns the categories of thought and thus the subject-object form of ordinary language. Wittgenstein and Derrida have other reasons for their comments on language but Hegel, Kant and Zen roughly share a metaphysical view by which language must be transcended for truth. Or, to put it another way, dualism must be overcome for unity. The point here is that language is inevitably dualistic just as are our thoughts. The 'elephant in the fridge' example you give is not a koan. A koan has a certain stucture and purpose and teaches a certain approach to analysis. The candle and match example tells us something about dualism. Many koans ask us to reconsider the dualism inherent in our thoughts. They are not simply absurd questions but are carefully formulated. They ask us to consider the possibility that Kant was right about the categories of thought and see that that a fundamental theory must abandon dualism for non-dualism. Nicolas de Cusa uses the phrase 'beyond the coincidence of contradictories' to decribe the Ultimate he has seen in his vision and this is an elegant way to say 'beyond the categories'. I would ignore Wittgenstein and Derrida and examine how the Perennial philosophy explains the limits of language. Hegel and Kant are worth a read but they stuggled to get to the bottom of things. Buddhist philosophy would be the easiest way into the topic. The entire topic is summarised and explained by Lao Tsu's remark 'True words seem paradoxical'. This would be the case because for metaphysical or fundamental truth we must avoid the dualism inherent in ordinary language and employ a language of contradictory complementarity. This cannot properly capture the tuth but may at least be rigorous. The topic is too deep and difficult to explain here but there is an extensive literature. You ask - "Is my understanding correct? Does this belong to metaphysics, ontology, epistemology or phenomenology? How do they connect to science?" Your understanding will be correct when you have understood Zen koans and the Tao Te Ching. Not an easy task but doable. These ideas belong in metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and phenomenology. I would say they connect with every area of knowledge without exception. They would connect with science wherever science examines foundations and fundamentals thus in theoretical physics, the foundations of maths, consciousness studies, logic, depth psychology, cosmology and so forth. I'll come back and recommend a book if I can think of one that deals specifically with this topic. Usually it's dealt with as part of a much broader disussion. 

We need a TOE if we are ever going to make sense of the world. All phenomena are connected and so if our theory is non-reductive or partial it does not fully deal with even one phenomenon. --"What are the philosophical/empirical considerations that push many scientists to look for a TOE?" Scientists do not look for a TOE, or not as part of the day job. For a general theory we have to take a higher viewpoint and study metaphysics. What scientists call a TOE is usually a completed Standard Model or somesuch, thus a theory of hardly anything at all. A TOE must explain metaphysics and solve all of its problems. Of course, there is no reason why a scientist should not search for a TOE, but they'd have to stand back from the test tubes and start wondering about the origins and nature of the laws of physics, consciousness, ethics, space-time and so on. If we confine ourselves to the natural sciences we cannot have a TOE. --"Is there any reasonable reason (other than aesthetic) to look for a TOE rather that trying to explain different things with different theories ?" Yes! We cannot understand the world if all we have is piecemeal theories. All metaphysical questions are immediately connected such that we cannot pick one out and have an isolated theory to cover it. It's all or nothing. This no less true for scientists than it is for anyone else. For a philosopher the situation is even more stark. If we do not have a theory of everything then we do not have a theory of anything at all, just isolated conjectures. Scientists do not search for a TOE, (albeit they do use this word). They search for theories limited to their domain. meanwhile philosophers must search for a TOE or go home. The idea we can have a theory of, say, space-time, freewill or ethics while having no general theory is a serious error of thinking and recipe for an endless muddle of mutually inconsistent partial theories - as we see from the academic literature. 

Long ago I came across a statement by Aristotle, 'True knowledge is identical with its object'. I never came across it again and now wonder where I found it. Is there an Aristotle scholar here who knows where this statement appears? Thanks if so. 

It's a good question. But your conclusion, that truth is impossible to find, is not correct. Have a look at the idea of 'knowledge by identity'. This is not a matter of logic or reason and does not suffer from the uncertainty to which the conclusions of reason and logic are prone. 'Truth' can only be what we know to be true. Thus 'true knowledge' is the issue here. For Aristotle, who was well aware of the limits of analysis, the only true and certain knowledge is an identity of knower and known, where the knower is one with the object of knowledge. This is the only certain knowledge we can have, thus the only form of truth. In this way the Oracles' advice to 'know thyself' is relevant. We see this in Descartes initial axiom, for he realised that only our identity is certain knowledge. What can we learn from our own identity? The mystics would say that all metaphysical truths can be known from this. Lao Tsu, among many others, claims to have learned how the world begins and ends in this way. We may not believe him, but at least he does not claim to know truths in any other way than logic concludes they can be known. Don't give up on truth. It is there to be discovered if we use the correct methods to search for it. But it is not truth until you know it is, so you won't find it in a book. You do know at least one metaphysical truth, which is 'I am'.
