This article Bumblebees finally cleared for takeoff is a good summary of a Cornell physicist's research in the year 2000 mathematically demonstrating and simulating why bees and similar insects can fly. 

No, and I consider this 11 page publication to be the most authoritative assessment of the matter. It covers all the topics you've raised, as well as assessing whether it was possible that elephants were once capable of jumping (they weren't). With respect to your mention of the "Elephant Jumping Festival" - that is false, and discussed at the end of page 6. Page 7 covers the origin of the mythical anecdotes that baby elephants have been observed jumping. Furthermore experiments conducted to test this explicitly (by dangling food out of reach) have never produced this behaviour. [1] Natan Slifkin.

This study focused on Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, and how intermittent fasting increased autophagy of Schwann cells (which is apparently a good thing). One final article, a little older than the others, but that will probably interest you more, is a generic treatment of how autophagy is triggered by caloric restriction and leads to a decrease in age-related manifestations that are a result of reduced autophagic activities. [6] *NOTE * My research has yet to show whether intermittent fasting leads to increased autophagy of infected cells that would not normally undergo autophagy as part of the natural immune response. 

Autophagy improves overall health A mutitude of Google scholar results confirms that Autophagy (in simple terms, cellular self-digestion) has a myriad of health benefits. The best example is probably this one: 

So not only is it the main ingredient in an unapproved cancer treatment, it's been linked to Parkinson's disease. [Ref] That doesn't mean it doesn't have potential. Research is just incomplete. From $URL$ 

To me, this is a huge misinterpretation of the observational study (N Engl J Med), which appears to have merely correlated self-proclaimed coffee drinkers with living longer. We know of course that correlation does not imply causation, and the relationship could be due to a number of things, such as the possible fact that coffee drinkers tend to wake up earlier and have more active days, which might improve their overall health. Is there anything in this or any other study to actually suggest a causal relationship between drinking coffee and living longer, or is this being blown out of proportion by popular media? 

Following this evidence the Muslims had chess by at least 651, which is after Muhammad had died. There is considerable evidence that they did not invent the game, but mainly helped pass the game from Persia to Europe. As far as the game and its rules are concerned, most of it appears to have been developed in India and Persia (pre-Islamic conquering) and then later modified to its modern form largely due to Western Europe and Spain. I know a lot of these sources are from Wikipedia, but they were the only ones that I could find with citations in them. There are other articles about this with similar information, but have no citations. 

It appears to be true. After finding a Reddit thread and reading through the comments I found a post by a user name XanderLink. 

App State law school Shooting. I'll sum this one up. It did involve an two students who were off duty officers, a county sheriff and a police officer. They confronted the man who had shot several people and he dropped his gun at that point and was subdued by several other students. This posting lists 2 of the events I have listed as well as two more. One did involve a former police officer. Most of these the shooter was stopped after someone was killed, but in this example, the shooters were stopped before anyone was killed. 

His reply did not really confirm the existence of a real app, nor deny it. The founders are supposed to be speaking at SXSW today in Austin so once that happens more will be known. Until that happens no one can conclusively say if this is real or not. 

First off NASA thought it might hit in 2029, but it was a 1:233 chance that it would. They do know now that Apophis will not, or is extremely unlikely to impact Earth. The first announcement of Apophis was on December 24, 2004. So it only took 3 days for them to conclude that the original calculations were off because of the incomplete/inaccurate information that they had at the time. 

I'm leaving my original post as is below but from the above edit, you can see that the app is fake. ORIGINAL POST: It is real, or at least giving the impression of being a real app that is going to be released soon. From the Engadget article on it. 

It as been seen twice (1950 & 2001) and been able to record how it moved. We will see it again in 2032 and be able to more accurately calculate if it may hit or not. As of right now the uncertainty is caused by several things. 

Per NHS, this type of prospective cohort study can find associations, but it cannot prove direct cause and effect. 

Higher trans fatty acids (TFAs) intake from partially hydrogenated oils is known to be associated with the risk of coronary heart disease and sudden death. 

TL;DR: Shave results tend to be affected by preshave, during-shave and post-shave techniques. Post-shaving moisturizers containing specific ingredients help in smoothing skin, reduction of underlying tissue damage and damaged skin barrier repair. 

Per Hashem Kilani et.al. in 2010, the ideal body fat percentage (BFP) % calculated in a Mr. Fitness competition "super body category" was between 5.6 and 6.7 for twenty-four athletes intentionally selected, with heights of 166–190 cm and aged 20–42 years."Three percent is the lowest level of essential body fat needed for males to survive without hazardous health problems." Per Yunus Barisik's research summarization on body fat levels of elite athletes, "most elite drug-free bodybuilders compete at body fat levels between 6.8 and 9.9% body fat". Also per Scientific American, Seattle-based speed skater Apolo Ohno's body consisted of only 2.8 percent fat and Marina Mourtzakis explains that "snowboarders probably have a normal amount of fat, whereas long-distance and endurance athletes [like speed skaters, cross-country skiers and biathletes] likely have less." 

Laws against conversion by Christian missionaries existed before the nation of India became independent in 1947. 

Hard water is defined as water containing a high concentration of calcium and magnesium ions. However, hardness can be caused by several other dissolved metals including aluminum, barium, strontium, iron, zinc, and manganese. WHO in 2003 reported that hard water has no known adverse health effects. 

Several quotes like these are excerpts from the article 'Democracies end when they are too democratic' by Andrew Sullivan as viewed here and youtube video shared by the OP also mentions this animation as an argument by the British-American author and blogger Andrew Sullivan about lessons to be learnt from Plato. 

The oldest known representation of two snakes entwined around a rod is that of the Sumerian fertility god Ningizzida. According to Sumerian mythology, Ningizzida is the mother of Dumuzi (Tammuz) the god of spring vegetation and they both stood at the gate of heaven. Tamuz guarded the door of heaven and had the power of bestowing fertility. Source: Tower of Babel 

Limitations of squatting: Research shows a small rise in blood pressure in healthy and hypertensive patients adopting squatting posture and it has been been suggested that people with hypertension or higher risk of stroke should avoid it. Search process for the research listed above 

Research shows that decreases in melatonin production in human and animals are known to be caused by environmental lighting, especially short-wavelength lighting (between 470 and 525 nm). Research by NASA shows neither bright nor dim 555 nm light at night could improve performance to the same extent as blue light. Melatonin effects on sleep patterns and alertness are reported here, here and here. Effects of light 

ADDITIONAL EDIT: Apparently Gizmodo has posted an updated article where they were able to confirm that this is a fake app and even tracked down the hoaxers. A quote by Brandon Bloch, one of the hoaxers, explaining it. 

Since this conquest did not completely end until 651 and Muhammad died June 8, 632 AD, one could argue that chess was not brought to the Muslim world until 651, which is well after the death of Muhammad. However chess continued to develop until the 19th century when the bishop and queen were changed so they could move how they do now and several other rules of the game were changed. 

It appears that the higher your BAC the more features you can access, which is what makes the more interesting in my mind and also is what is going to make it controversial if it ever takes off. Sources: Engadget The Next Web EDIT: I have seen additional articles posted today that are much more skeptical of Livr, but none have conclusive proof that it is a hoax. The Network World article seems to be the only article that has gotten a response from either of the founders. 

The article then goes on the explain the transition of chess to Persia and then the transition to the Muslim world. 

If it continues uninterrupted there are two paths that they think it will take. One will miss earth by millions of kilometers and the other only has ~ a 1:300 chance of striking Earth. For a much more detailed description you can check out this NASA PDF detailing the probabilities of the DA 1950 collision. 

As this page on the origin of chess says, the game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia. 

Following the XanderLink's link (Not sure if that is his real name or stage name. He appears to be in the music industry.) I was able to find the original picture. he also has a Facebook note explaining his story. EDIT: After researching this a bit more I came across this article from International Business Times. It is about a woman who was holding her own heart after a transplant surgery. In the story it talks about the Reddit thread and the picture you were questioning. The story said the man in the picture was Brian Linkenhoker. The article had his name wrong. It is Brandon Linkenhoker and it appears that he is the man in the photo and has since passed away. In summary, with the evidence available, it appears to be a true story and a real picture. 

So in summation, Yes it does happen. When a shooting is stopped I am willing to say that it would get much less coverage. How often do you hear about good Samaritans vs criminals? Bad news brings more attention than good news. Bad news can cause sensationalism more so than good news, which will lead to increased viewer or reader numbers.
