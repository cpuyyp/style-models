Yes. You are missing the word "Sun". The IAU did not want to tackle the problem of how to categorize exoplanets. There are only eight planets in the entire universe, plus a good number of (five and counting) dwarf planets. An expoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri is not a planet or a dwarf planet, per the IAU definition. Some hypothesize that the early solar system contained five giant planets, but one of them was expelled. That rogue giant planet, if it exists, is not a planet per the IAU definition. You are treating the word "orbit" as if it's a mutually exclusive term. It's not. The Earth's Moon, for example, orbits the Earth and it orbits the Sun. But since the Moon is a satellite of the Earth, it's not a planet or a dwarf planet. Side note: the concept of what distinguishes a "satellite" from a non-satellite is not defined. 

You are correct. The Apollo lunar lander was 4 meters across, or about 2 milliarcseconds at a distance of 385000 kilometers. The Hubble has a resolution of 50 milliarcseconds. Even the Hubble can't see the tracks and artifacts that the Apollo astronauts left on the Moon, let alone a backyard astronomer. Regarding a backyard astronomer "seeing" the retroreflectors left on the Moon, that too is incorrect. "Seeing" those retroreflectors requires an extremely powerful pulsed laser, a rather large telescope, and rather expensive photodetectors. The final item is why I wrote "seeing" (in quotes) rather than seeing (without quotes). The professional astronomers who use those retroreflectors to measure the distance between the Earth and the Moon receive one reflected photon for every 1017 photons sent toward the Moon. They are looking for individual photons. Using pulsed lasers achieves two ends. First and foremost, it lets the astronomers measure distance. A continuous laser wouldn't let them do that. Secondly, it enables them to distinguish those individual photons from background noise. The lasers used in the lunar laser ranging experiments have a peak power in the gigawatts. An amateur backyard astronomer who a few million dollar or so to spare might be able to build a system that "sees" the retroreflectors left on the Moon. An amateur backyard astronomer cannot see the artifacts left on the Moon. 

That is incorrect. A debris field will circularize itself rather quickly. Collisions put some particles on an escape trajectory, other particles on a collision trajectory, with what's left tending toward having nearly circular orbits. 

What prompted that comment that the TRAPPIST-1 planets may be subject to tidal heating is that some of those planets appear to be in an orbital resonance, with periods being very close to small integer multiples of one another. 

Speculating what humanity will do or become 500 million years from now is a bit much. It's not science; nobody will live to see whether there speculations turn out to be true. But it is a bit fun. Why would we relocate to Mars? Why not relocate Earth instead (Korycansky 2001)? We might eventually have to worry about Mars getting in the way. In that case, simply move Mars, too! 

The stars in our galaxy are extremely close to us in a cosmological sense. Even the Andromeda galaxy is extremely close. The light we see from stars in our galaxy is more or less the same as emitted. 

That is correct. You were reading yet another poorly written wikipedia page. The information on that page isn't quite incorrect, but it isn't quite correct, either. There is no such thing as an annular lunar eclipse. That page would have been much more meaningful had it used the Moon's shadow as the example. The Moon's umbra trails from 368000 km to 381000 km behind the Moon, depending on how close the Moon is to the Sun. This is very similar to the distance between the center of the Moon and the closest point on the surface of the Earth to the Moon, which varies from 362000 km to 400000 km. When the Moon is directly between the Earth and the Sun, the resulting solar eclipse can be total or annular. When the Earth is directly between the Moon and the Sun, the resulting lunar eclipse is always total. 

Assume the universe is infinite The universe might well be infinitely large, but the observable universe is all that we can possibly see. By all signs, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. We can't see the stuff that is beyond the observable universe because not enough time has passed for light to have traveled that far. To make matters worse, the early universe was very hot and dense. Photons traveled but a short distance before being absorbed. We can't see those very early photons because they no longer exist. This changed about 379,000 years after the universe formed, at which time the universe had sufficiently cooled so as to allow photons to roam free. The photons let loose by that clearing of the universe form the cosmic microwave background radiation. 

This is not true. In the absence of other gravitational sources, a planet and a star move in elliptical orbits about the common center of mass. Ancient scientists assumed circular orbits, but only because circles were somehow most pure. There were problems with this: It didn't match what those ancient scientists saw. So they modified these circular orbits by tacking on other circles. It was a mess. Kepler cleaned this mess up by noting that the orbits of the planets are very close to elliptical rather than circular. This empirical result was later strengthened by Newton, who derived that elliptical orbits (not circular orbits) are a natural consequence of a force that follows an inverse square law. Gravitation is such a force. The orbits of the planets about the solar system are not quite elliptical because planets are attracted to one another as well as to the Sun. Nonetheless, the orbits are still very close to elliptical. The Sun is more than 1000 times more massive than Jupiter. Jupiter, Saturn, and the other planets represent tiny perturbations on the nearly elliptical orbits of the planets about the Sun. What about other perturbing effects, such as nearby stars and the Milky Way as a whole? These are immeasurably small. A passing star will perturb planetary orbits over the course of the tens of millions of years or more. The Milky Way as a whole has essentially no effect whatsoever. Theoretically, the effect most certainly does exist, but it is so small that it can be ignored, even over the lifespan of the solar system. 

Neutron stars cannot stay hot forever. Neutron stars cool because they radiate. (This is called radiational cooling.) Except for their gravitational field which distorts spacetime in the vicinity of a neutron star, most lone neutron stars slowly fade away over time, eventually becoming essentially invisible. One way of detecting those cold, lone neutron stars is to observe the gravitational lensing of stars behind them. With regard to magnetic field and rotation, those too drop over time. A neutron star's rotation is what creates the magnetic field, but this magnetic field drains the rotation rate. An alternate fate for neutron stars is to undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole. This can happen in a number of ways. A massive neutron star can undergo collapse as a result of its slowing rotation rate. The initial rapid rotation staves off gravitational collapse, but that no longer works when the neutron star's rotation rate drops. Some neutron stars are not isolated. They are instead members of multiple star systems. Neutron stars can draw material from a partner star and eventually become massive enough to undergo collapse. Finally, a few neutron stars orbit one another closely. The discover of this, the Hulse-Taylor binary, led to the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. Those closely orbiting neutron stars emit gravitational waves, thereby causing the orbit to decay. Those neutron stars eventually collide, once again resulting in a gravitational collapse. 

Note that the tidal force is away from the center of the Earth when the Moon is directly overhead or directly underfoot, toward the center of the Earth when the Moon is on the horizon, and horizontal when the Moon is halfway between directly overhead/underfoot and on the horizon. The tidal force is maximum when the Moon is directly overhead, and even then it's only about 10-7 g. You need a sensitive instrument to read that. A simple pendulum or a simple spring will not do the trick. 

No, it is not. The Earth's axis of rotation precesses thanks to gravitational torques by the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's equatorial bulge. 

This is one of the very few times I will post a link to a youTube video. It is worth every eleven minutes. 

Short answer: Because the Moon is much closer to the Earth than it is to the Sun. This means the gravitational acceleration of the Earth toward the Sun is almost the same as is the gravitational acceleration of the Moon toward the Sun. The Moon's acceleration toward the Sun, $-GM_\odot\frac{\boldsymbol R+\boldsymbol r}{||\boldsymbol R+\boldsymbol r||^3}$ is indeed about twice that of the Moon toward the Earth, $-GM_\oplus\frac{\boldsymbol r}{||\boldsymbol r||^3}$. This is irrelevant. What is relevant is the Moon's earthward acceleration due to gravitation compared to the difference between the Moon's and Earth's sunward gravitational acceleration, $$\boldsymbol a_{\odot,\text{rel}} = -GM_{\odot}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol R + \boldsymbol r}{||\boldsymbol R + \boldsymbol r||^3} - \frac{\boldsymbol R}{||\boldsymbol R||^3}\right)$$ This relative acceleration toward the Sun is a small perturbation (less than 1/87th in magnitude) on the Moon's gravitational acceleration toward the Earth. Given the current circumstances, the Sun can't pull the Moon away from the Earth. 

No. This is the first difference between Moon phases and Earth phases. Earth phase on the Moon is a function of lunar longitude and time of lunar day. You won't see a full Earth one night and a new Earth some other night. 

Yes. The Sun also raises tides, but smaller in magnitude than those raised by the Moon. The heights of the tides raised by the Sun are a bit less than half those raised by the Moon. 

No. In a system of particles bound by central forces such as self-gravitation, Coulomb forces, and chemical bonds, the acceleration of the system's center of mass is the net sum of the external forces acting on the individual particles, divided by the total mass. 

A bit too simply (but not too much), it's the angle between the planet's rotational angular velocity vector and the planet's orbital angular momentum vector. Where it gets tricky is dealing with little wobbles and such. Planets don't quite orbit in a plane because of gravitational interactions amongst the planets. This means the instantaneous (osculating) orbital angular momentum vector isn't quite constant, both in magnitude and direction. There are a number of different mean orbital elements that smooth out most of those tiny wobbles. One of those mean orbital elements sets (I'm not sure which one exactly) is used to determine the mean orbital angular momentum vector. Planets don't quite rotate nice and smoothly because planets aren't perfect spheres and aren't rigid bodies. This gives the Moon, the Sun, and other planets a handle by which they can exert tiny little torques in the planet in question. The response of the planet to these torques is somewhat arbitrarily divided into two categories based on frequency. Very slow responses are called precession; faster responses, nutation. The non spherical nature of a planet means the planet undergoes a small torque-free nutation as well as the torque-induced precession, nutation, and polar motion. In addition to these, there are a number of terms (all small) that don't yet have a very good model behind them. This oddball terms, along with the torque-free nutation, are collectively called polar motion. The motion is fairly smooth if one ignores nutation and polar motion, and the effects are all small. Precession, while very slow, can be quite large in magnitude. The rotational angular velocity vector that is used in determining the axial tilt incorporates precession but smooths out nutation and polar motion. 

No. The Moon formed at four to six Earth radii, far less than the 40.6 Earth radii figure cited above. The Moon's orbit initially looked like your second image. 

Yes, but that condition is not what I would call "perfectly homogenous". What's needed is a non-spherical mass distribution. For example, a uniform density ellipsoidal body would have its center of mass and center of figure of coinciding, but would still be subject to torques. It's the moment of inertia that is key rather than the offset between center of mass and center of figure. An object whose center of mass and center of figure do not coincide necessarily has a non-spherical moment of inertia tensor. 

Currently Polaris is at a declination of a bit over 89 degrees, which means that no one south of 1 degree south latitude can see Polaris. That's almost all of the Southern hemisphere, let alone the South Pole. Polaris won't be the North Star forever, thanks to axial precession. In about 13000 years or so, Polaris will have a declination of about 46 degrees or so (twice the 23 degree axial tilt). Polaris will thus be visible in 13000 years or so as a wintertime star to all of Africa, all of Australia, and most of South America, but none of Antarctica. After millions of years, proper motion may make Polaris visible over Antarctica. But then again, being a yellow supergiant, its unlikely that Polaris will be visible anywhere (without a telescope). It will instead be dead. 

From the perspective of the Moon, the Earth exhibits phases just as does the Moon when viewed from the perspective of the Earth. There are however some differences. One difference is that the phase of the Earth at a fixed local lunar time will be pretty much the same from one day to the next. This is a result of the fact that the Moon is tidally locked. Another difference is that earthlight is considerably brighter than moonlight. This is a consequence of the Earth's significantly larger albedo and significantly larger diameter compared to the Moon. A third difference is that except for locations close to ±90° lunar longitude, the Earth doesn't rise and set. 

Longer answer: The gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the Moon is more twice that exerted by the Earth on the Moon. So why do we say the Moon orbits the Earth? This has two answers. One is that "orbit" is not a mutually exclusive term. Just because Moon orbits the Earth (and it does) does not mean that it doesn't also orbit the Sun (or the Milky Way, for that matter). It does. The other answer is that gravitational force as-is is not a good metric. The gravitational force from the Sun and Earth are equal at a distance of about 260000 km from the Earth. The short-term and long-term behaviors of an object orbiting the Earth at 270000 km are essentially the same as those of an object orbiting the Earth at 250000 km. That 260000 km where the gravitational forces from the Sun and Earth are equal in magnitude is effectively meaningless. A better metric is the distance at which an orbit remain stable for a long, long, long time. In the two body problem, orbits at any distance are stable so long as the total mechanical energy is negative. This is no longer the case in the multi-body problem. The Hill sphere is a somewhat reasonable metric in the three body problem. The Hill sphere is an approximation of a much more complex shape, and this complex shape doesn't capture long-term dynamics. An object that is orbiting circularly at (for example) 2/3 of the Hill sphere radius won't remain in a circular orbit for long. Its orbit will instead become rather convoluted, sometimes dipping as close to 1/3 of the Hill sphere radius from the planet, other times moving slightly outside the Hill sphere. The object escapes the gravitational clutches of the planet if one of those excursions beyond the Hill sphere occurs near the L1 or L2 Lagrange point. In the N-body problem (for example, the Sun plus the Earth plus Venus, Jupiter, and all of the other planets), the Hill sphere remains a reasonably good metric, but it needs to be scaled down a bit. For an object in a prograde orbit such as the Moon, the object's orbit remains stable for a very long period of time so long as the orbital radius is less than 1/2 (and maybe 1/3) of the Hill sphere radius. The Moon's orbit about the Earth is currently about 1/4 of the Earth's Hill sphere radius. That's well within even the most conservative bound. The Moon has been orbiting the Earth for 4.5 billion years, and will continue to do so for a few more billions of years into the future.
