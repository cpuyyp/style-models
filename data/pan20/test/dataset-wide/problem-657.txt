You will need to change the cassette, chain and possibility the chain rings on your bike. change all of them at the same time to ensure they wear out at the same time and you don't have a worn chain wearing out a new cassette at a faster rate for example (or vice versa). You can also check the freehub as it may be worn out. This is what the cassette spins on and it can wear out. To change this you need a large allen key (I forget what size) and you'll need to remove the cassette first. 

I seem to have amassed a huge collection of bike parts. Some parts are old and need a specialist market so I don't think that ebay is the best marketplace for them. How can I sell on / give away old bike parts so I know that I'm getting the best price and/or reaching the right audience. 

In my experience of riding on snow both with a fully loaded touring bike and with a mountain bike. With the touring bike do your best to keep the bike upright and turn in short stages. As previously mentioned brake early and turn gently. However, if you are cornering at speed the best idea would be to stick a dabbing leg out if you feel the tyres are slipping away. If you ride on snow you will get some bite with normal tyres but it will wash out intermittently. You can go for some studded or spike tyres and these can allow you to ride happily on snow at any speed. I once saw a guide riding up a piste like this. 

I've got a set of wide carbon bars on my mountain bike. I get painful wrists after riding because of the shape of the bars. They are pretty much flat with a slight backsweep. How do I know which bars I should buy and what is the benefit of rise and backsweep on handlebars? 

It sounds like your drivetrain is worn out. You may need to replace the gear changer. In the short term you can experiment with a shorter chain. Have you got the right size chain? Is your cassette 7,8,9 speed? because each takes a different size chain. 

I was just looking at the new On One Codeine full suss mountain bike and 45650B hardtail (£2599 vs £899) respectively. However, what is the great difference apart from the shock? A fox rear shock goes for about £300 max. What causes the giant price difference? 

There are a lot of adventure touring bikes, or bikes designed for bikepacking, off-road touring and the like. But what is the difference between one of these and a standard mountain bike. E.g. what is the difference between the Salsa Fargo frame and something like the Kona Explosif. Or what is the difference between the Thorn Nomad or Raven and an Orange P7. I understand that the touring frames are more likely to have rack eyelets, but what are the other differences in design? 

I've got a set of Sun Rhynolyte rims and in the features it says they have a triple-hollow construction. What does that mean? 

I've got a pair of Rockshox Reba race forks. I'm going to service them. Fork oil weight says 5wt but in the past I have generally used a heavier oil weight 7.5 / 10 wt due to my size. However, saying that, the rebound damping is so effective and adjustable on this fork that I don't have any problems like I used to- should I stick to the 5wt? 

Fatbikes are traditionally used for sand and snow which are surfaces which are loose and liable to break away under the weight of the bike and rider. They are also materials that don't generally stick to the tyre. A muddy surface such as a peaty or poor-condition dirt track after rainstorms would also provide some likelihood that the material will break away under the tread. However, mud is often sticky and likely to stick to a tyre. Therefore is mud more or less likely to stick to a fatbike wide with and diameter tyre than a small skinny ( < 2.5 inch ) mountain bike tyre where more pressure is being exerted over a small surface area, or more extreme a cyclocross tyre (these guys seem to ride and corner in muddy conditions successfully)? 

Are there any feasible solar chargers for iPhone / or with a usb slot that will work or is a backup battery available. Best value (and something that works) is my priority. I found this brilliant link on crazy guy on a bike- $URL$ However, since then I came accross 'portopow' $URL$ - which look great but I can barely find any reviews. 

@jm2 is the correct answer I would say. If there is oil on the pads then braking hard with them will just create heat and melt the surface of the pad, forming a shiny layer. This can be fixed by using white spirit and a little sand paper. Clean your disks with white spirit also. 

I've got an old road bike. I'm not exactly sure what the frame is as it was repainted. I've reason to believe the that bottom bracket is wrong because the crankset ring is too close to the chainstay. The crankset is a shimano golden arrow, similar to this picture $URL$ 

I currently have kevlar vittorio rubbino tyres on my road bike, but they don't have enough grip for the oncoming uk winter conditions. What level of tyre tread do I need for road commuting on uk winter roads and any recommendations welcome. I would still like to maintain a low weight and good rolling resistance. 

I'm considering getting some knee / shin protection for mountain biking but I'm aware that it might restrict my leg movement and make my legs hot if I get the wrong ones for the job (mostly XC riding). What kinds of protection is available for XC mountain biking with the potential of falling onto rocky trails at relatively low speeds (but still enough to be injured). 

I've got some Crosso panniers that have got quite a few holes in. I once fixed a drybag backpack with patches of leather and industrial strength glue which worked like a treat, but I've forgotten what glue it was (it came in a large tin and I spread it on with a knife)- it was in the textiles department at the uni I was studying in. Any advice / links / tricks would be great.
