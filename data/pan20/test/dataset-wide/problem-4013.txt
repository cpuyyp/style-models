Actually $C(X)$ and $C_0(X)$ are the same if $X$ is compact, but you want to denote it $C(X)$ to emphasize the fact that the algebra is already unital. Otherwise, when you add a unit, you take the one point compactification of a compact space which adds an extra point, which is not what you want. Now let's suppose you have some additional structure, like $X$ is a compact manifold. Then you probably want the $C^\infty$-functions on $X$. However, these can be recovered from $C(X)$ as those operators whose iterated commutator with the Dirac operator is bounded. This inspired the notion of a spectral triple. EDIT: In my haste to answer this question, I made some mistakes in the earlier answer as pointed out by @Jonas. 

Yes, strongly amenable subfactors of the hyperfinite $II_1$-factor are completely classified by their standard invariant. The finite depth case was done by Popa's Classification of subfactors: the reduction to commuting squares (MR1055708), and the infinite depth case was finished by Popa's Classification of amenable subfactors of type $II$ (MR1278111). The reconstruction theorem in this case reproduces a hyperfinite $II_1$-subfactor. The Guionnet-Jones-Shlyakhtenko construction reproduces an inclusion of interpolated free-group factors (arXiv:0911.4728), and there is a specific formula for which factors you get. So you need to start with the right factors (modulo the free-group factor isomorphism problem...). EDIT: Noah's answer makes a really important point. I should point out that at index 6, Bisch, Nicoara, and Popa constructed an uncountable family of (non-amenable) subfactors of the hyperfinite $II_1$-factor with the same standard invariant with property (T) (MR2314611). As they say in the abstract: 

In mathematics, quantization often refers to some kind of deformation of a classical object. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the position and momentum operators do not commute. In fact, $[X,P]=i\hbar$. In the limit as $\hbar\to 0$, these operators commute once again. Technically speaking, this is nonsense as $\hbar$ is a universal constant, but in mathematics, we are free to play with parameters. A couple of examples include: 

Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a_1a_2'}{a_1'}\frac{a_1'}{b_2b_1'}=\frac{a_1a_2'}{b_2b_1'}. $$ Now note that $\displaystyle \frac{a_2'}{b_1'}=\frac{a_2}{b_1}$, so we have $$ \varphi(g_1g_2)=\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a_1}{b_2}\frac{a_2}{b_1}= \frac{a_1}{b_1}\frac{a_2}{b_2}=\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2). $$ 

For a discrete group, if you're amenable and you have property (T), then you're finite. For a subfactor, if you're amenable and you have property (T), then you're finite depth. So once you're in the infinite depth property (T) setting, there's no hope for a bijective correspondence between subfactors and planar algebras. 

Question 2: Given a pivotal braided category $\mathcal{C}$, there are 2 ways to endow $\mathcal{C}$ with twists under which $\mathcal{C}$ is a rigid balanced category. Conversely, given a rigid balanced category $\mathcal{C}$, there are 2 ways to endow $\mathcal{C}$ with a pivotal structure under which $\mathcal{C}$ is braided pivotal. These constructions are mutually inverse. This is all explained in detail in Appendix A.2 of my recent article with Henriques and Tener $URL$ (These results are not original, but we give a comprehensive treatment there.) Of interest to you may also be Section 2.3, which gives a synoptic chart of the types of tensor category. Question 3: No, not necessarily. For example, the center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ of any pivotal fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ is pivotal braided, but it is not ribbon unless $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$ is spherical. In general, there is no reason for this to be the case. In fact for a semisimple category $\mathcal{C}$, pivotal braided is ribbon if and only if it is spherical. This is Proposition A.4 in our preprint. Question 1: I suspect the answer is that there is not necessarily any interesting twist in only the presence of a pivotal structure. I don't have an example off the top of my head though. But when you also have a braiding, you're in business as explained in the answer to Question 2 above. So to sum up the bit at the end, yes, ribbon fusion is the same as spherical braided fusion, because the category is semisimple. 

Here are some partial answers: 1- Usually the fusion category is the category of bifinite correspondences, i.e. Hilbert spaces with actions of $N$ and $M$ whose module dimensions are finite. Jones has a result saying that a bifinite correspondence is irreducible if and only if the algebraic module of bounded vectors is irreducible (on his website, two subfactors and the algebraic decomposition...). This means the fusion category of bifinite correspondences should be equivalent to the fusion category of algebraic bimodules (you probably need bifinite in the sense of Lueck, but this is very technical). The former category is generated by the $N-M$ correspondence $L^(M)$, and the later category is generated by $M$ as an $N-M$ bimodule (generated in the sense of taking tensor products and decomposing into irreducibles). In fact, Morrison, Peters, and Snyder use the algebraic category in their recent paper on extended Haagerup (arXiv:0909.4099v1). 2- This isn't what you're asking, but $L^2(M)$ as an $N-M$ bimodule is a Morita equivalence from $N$-Hilbert modules to $M_1$-Hilbert modules where $M_1$ is the basic construction of $N\subset M$. I just think it's an interesting point to bring up. 4- One of the best ways of constructing subfactors is via planar algebras. Given a suitable fusion category, one can construct a planar algebra. Typical examples of these nice fusion categories are the fusion categories arising from the representation theory of a finite group or a quantum group. This gives rise to a family of subfactors. In fact, since (for finite groups) there are only finitely many irreducible representations, we have that this planar algebra will be finite depth (see arXiv:0808.0764, section 4.1), and the subfactor constructed from this planar algebra will be finite depth as well. When someone says "exotic subfactor," they mean a finite index, finite depth subfactor that doesn't appear in the well known families coming from these fusion categories. To date, the best way of constructing these subfactors is to stumble upon a finite bipartite graph which doesn't appear as a fusion graph determine if it can be a principal graph for a subfactor. This has inspired a program to classify all principal graphs which can occur (see the extended Haagerup paper for a synopsis of this as well). Tie in to 3- Two exotic subfactors, namely the Haagerup and extended Haagerup subfactor, have been constructed by finiding a subfactor planar algebra with the appropriate principal graph inside the graph planar algebra of the bipartite graph (this technique was first explored in detail in Peters' thesis). These subfactors have index equal to the square of the norm of the graph, which is the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. In fact, if a finite index subfactor is extremal (irreducible implies extremal), then the norm squared of the principal graph is always the Jones index. (One typically computes Jones index by computing the von Neumann dimension of the $N$-Hilbert module $L^2(M)$.) 5- I know that Kawahigashi et al. (see arXiv:0811.4128) have found a net of type $III_1$-factors corresponding to intervals on the circle. I would recommend starting there. 

For fusion categories, there is a hyperfinite embedding result which does not require passing to ultraproducts. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a unitary fusion category, then by results of Popa [MR1055708] (see also [MR3028581, Theorem 4.1]), there is a finite index, depth two subfactor, which we could reasonably denote $R\subset R\rtimes\mathcal{C}$, whose principal even half is $\mathcal{C}$. (Here, $R$ is the hyperfinite II$_1$-factor.) Moreover, by Popa's theorem, $R\subset R\rtimes \mathcal{C}$ is the unique hyperfinite subfactor up to subfactor isomorphism with this standard invariant. As a corollary, every unitary fusion category has an essentially unique realization as a concrete category of bifinite bimodules over $R$. (One has to be careful to get the correct uniqueness statement here.) I'm not really sure how to introduce ultraproducts or Connes' embedding conjecture into this story. I'll think it over, and if I have something reasonable to say, I'll edit this answer. 

Let $N\subseteq M$ be an inclusion of semi-finite factors with normal faithful semi-finite traces $\operatorname{Tr}_N$ and $\operatorname{Tr}_M$ respectively. Let $T: M^+\to \widehat{N^+}$ be the unique trace-preserving normal faithful semi-finite operator valued weight. As for normal weights, we define \begin{align*} \mathfrak{n}_T &= \left\{x\in M \,\middle|\, T(x^*x)\in N^+\right\} \\ \mathfrak{m}_T &= \mathfrak{n}_T^*\mathfrak{n}_T \\ \mathfrak{p}_T &= \left\{x\in M^+\,\middle|\,T(x)\in N^+\right\} \end{align*} It is straightforward to show that $\mathfrak{n}_T$ is a left ideal, $\mathfrak{m}_T\subset \mathfrak{n}_T\cap \mathfrak{n}_T^*$ is a hereditary $*$-algebra, both $\mathfrak{n}_T$ and $\mathfrak{m}_T$ are $N-N$ bimodules, and $\mathfrak{m}_T$ is spanned by its positive part $\mathfrak{m}_T^+$, which in turn is equal to $\mathfrak{p}_T$. Moreover, $T$ has a canonical extension to a map $\mathfrak{m}_T\to N$. Thus if $x\in \mathfrak{m}_T$ is self-adjoint, we can write $x=x_1-x_2$ with $x_1,x_2\in \mathfrak{p}_T$. But it is not clear to me if $\mathfrak{m}_T$ is closed under taking the Hahn-Jordan decomposition of $x$. That is: 

One example when you should "choose" a basis for your proofs is when there is an obvious choice of basis, e.g., group algebras and path algebras (paths on a Bratteli diagram give an orthonormal basis for a Hilbert space). The subfactor equivalent to a basis is called a Pimsner-Popa basis. As of yet, there is no way to define the canonical planar algebra associated to a subfactor without choosing a basis (even though the result is independent of the choice). Another example of the "right proof" requiring picking a basis is Michael Burns' proof that the rotation is periodic on the relative commutants of a finite index $II_1$-subfactor. There is a way to show this basis independently (see Planar Algebras I, arXiv:math/9909027, pages 84-85), but Burns' treatment is more elegant. 

There is an irreducible Temperley-Lieb subfactor at every allowed index. For $n\geq 3$, it has index $4\cos^2(\pi/n)$ and principal graph $A_{n-1}$ (in fact all subfactors of index less than $4$ are irreducible), and for every $r\geq 4$, it has index $r$ and principal graph $A_\infty$. Doesn't that do the job by your remark? 

One of the reasons I study von Neumann algebras is that they always have plenty of projections. There are many projectionless $C^\ast$-algebras ($0$ and possibly $1$ are the only projections), but the von Neumann algebras they generate must have nontrivial projections (unless it's just the complex numbers, of course). A good example of this is the reduced group $C^\ast$-algebra of any free group $F_n$. If $n=1$, then $C_r^\ast(Z)\cong C(S^1)$ via the Gelfand transform, which is clearly projectionless. If $n\geq 2$, the proof is fairly complicated. See Davidson's book for a proof when $n=2$. If $G$ is a torsion-free group, is the reduced group $C^\ast$-algebra of $G$ projectionless? This $C^\ast$-algebra always contains the group algebra $C[G]$, so a simpler question is whether $C[G]$ is projectionless if $G$ is torsion-free. Note that torsion-free is a necessary condition as one gets a projection from summing up the elements in the cyclic group generated by a torsion element and dividing by the order of the element. EDIT: changed typestting. still some bugs... help please? 

These are also known as fusion rule algebras. An important question is given such an algebra, when does it arise as the Grothendieck ring of a fusion category? (I did not see the normalization condition 3 in your definition above in the definition of a table algebra, so it looks like these qualify. Please correct me if I'm mistaken.) It turns out that given any unital based ring $(A,B)$, there is a unique ring homomorphism $d: A\to \mathbb{C}$ such that $d(b_i)>0$ for all $i\in I$. Also, $A\otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{C}$ is semisimple, so it is a direct sum of matrix algebras. Since $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ has no characters, we see that $A\otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{C}\cong \mathbb{C}^4$, which is abelian. This argument appears in Larson's "Pseudo-unitary non-self-dual fusion categories of rank 4" (MR3229513), which treats the case of pseudo-unitary categorifiable rank 4 unital based rings such that $*$ is not the identity (there is a dual pair $b_1^*=b_2$ WLOG). The case where $*$ is the identity seems much more difficult. Certainly you can write down the associativity equations for $(A,B)$ and look for integral solutions, but there are infinitely many solutions. (This is already the case in rank 2 and 3. In rank 2, there's only one possible family, and I'm not sure how many families there are for rank 3. See Ostrik's "Pivotal fusion categories of rank 3" arXiv:1309.4822). I know of several infinite families of possible rings for rank 4 with $*=Id$, but I do not know how many infinite families there are. One expects there should only be finitely many categorifiable rank 4 unital based rings. One interesting infinite family of unital based rings is the near groups. The basis here consists of a finite group $G$ together with one additional symbol $\rho$ satisfying the following:
