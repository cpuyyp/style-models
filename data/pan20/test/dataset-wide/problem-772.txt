Surprisingly, we will soon be able to do this well enough to go back several hundred million years and place ourselves, if not in the solar system, inside the Galaxy and roughly in the right part of the Galaxy. It turns out that we know, with high accuracy, the Earth's motion with respect to the microwave background radiation, which provides a well defined frame of reference for motions. Therefore, we will be able to work out which direction and about how far the MW has moved with respect to this universal frame and separately the Earth with respect to the center of the galaxy. It requires solving for the growth of what is called the 'microwave dipole velocity' over time. Some of this velocity develops from nearby objects like the MW and the nearby groups of galaxies. So, we need to know their masses and relative motions a bit better than we presently do. But, by far, most of the velocity is from objects quite far away, and this allows us to use the simpler and well understood 'perturbation' techniques. The biggest uncertainty for the Earth's position might be the interactions with local stars back in time and what effects they had on perturbing the Suns orbital motion about the center of the galaxy. Again we need to know better the masses of local stars and their relative velocities to calculate the Earth's trajectory back in time. As it happens, the space telescope GAIA, which is about to make its second release of data, will greatly improve our knowledge of the motions and, indirectly, the masses of all these stars and nearby galaxies. So, if you have got that time machine working, we are nearly ready to go! 

Gravitational interactions with stars they pass could strip some Oort cloud bodies, or send then into the system as comets, or whatever Whatever caused this star to become a hypervelocity star in the first place (eg a close encounter with a supermassive black hole) might well have disrupted the Oort cloud, possibly fatally. 

The short answer is "yes" -- the property of being a black hole. Assuming the collision is at a reasonably low relative velocity, the black hole would consume most of the mass of the star, so that eventually you would be left with a much bigger black hole and a certain amount of matter and radiation heading away from the site where the collision took place. The details of how long this would take, how much matter and energy would escape and so on will vary depending on the exact structure of the star and the details of the collision. Essentially you can't disrupt a black hole much by throwing matter into it (if the matter you throw in is VERY dense, like another black hole or a neutron star there will be some temporary disturbance to the event horizon, but it will settle down in a fraction of a second), all it does is absorb the matter and get bigger. Even if the matter is super-hot dense fusing plasma from the centre of giant star. In the course of falling in, the matter gets distorted and heated (much hotter than the interior of even a large star) and sometimes whirled around the black hole, and this can appear as a huge explosion, but in the middle of it, the black hole is sitting there absorbing matter, largely unperturbed. 

Yes. When a core collapse supernova happens, it takes a few hours for the shock wave to reach the surface and "break out" (when we first "see" it). Meanwhile, the neutrinos can escape nearly directly once they reach the top of the core. Of course, as you wrote, photons travel slightly faster, so if the SN is far enough away, the photons might overtake these neutrinos. However, I have not done the calculation to see if the universe is big enough. 

The resolution of a telescope is the resolution of the image created by the primary mirror at the focal plane. It provides the minimum separation between two equal brightness stars that appear separate in that image. Often, astronomers put a photographic plate or a CCD at the focal plane, create long exposure photos and these can then be examined at arbitrary resolution (with a magnifying glass, microscope, or zoom software on a screen). But, no matter how much you magnify the image, stars separated by less than the resolution will appear merged. It is true that if you use, say, a wide-angle lens when observing directly with a telescope the resolution that you get can be limited by the resolution of your eye. What is happening is the telescope is forming an image on your retina that has the full resolution, but your eye cannot make use of the finest details. On the other hand, a hawk looking through the same eyepiece may get full resolution benefits since hawks' eyes have better resolution than humans'. 

Any moon exerts a tidal force on its primary, tending to cause the primary to bulge outward along the axis passing the moon and to narrow slightly in the other two directions. This effect is greater if the moon in question is larger and/or closer to the primary, but a solid primary may largely resist it, so that it changes shape little if at all. In the case of the Earth and its Moon, the solid Earth moves relatively little, while the water of the oceans is moved quite a bit. As a result, water has to flow from one place to another over the solid crust. That flow causes friction, which causes the "bulge" of water to lag behind the Moon and pull back on it by gravity. This process gradually slows the rotation of the Earth and drives the Moon further away. This process acts, in general to bring the rotation of the planet and the revolution of the Moon to the same rate, so that the planet keeps one face to the Moon. Usually this means slowing the planet's rotation, but a few moons are so close to the planet that it would be the opposite. This process will be less pronounced on a planet which has a deeper liquid layer, since there will be less friction, or on a planet which has a stiff solid structure, since there will be less movement. The number of moons is not directly relevant. To a reasonable approximation they all work independently. 

The first thing you need to recall is that electromagnetic waves do carry momentum as well as energy. This shows up in effects like light pressure. Specifically a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ carries momentum $h/\lambda$. In and of itself, that doesn't answer your question though, since you are asking about the rotation of the pulsar, and changed to its linear momentum don't affect that. However, there are two ways this can happen. First imagine a rotating sphere which is emitting radiation from its equator. Consider a point on that equator. The radiation it is emitting "forwards" (in the direction towards which it is rotating) will be blue shifted (as seen by a stationary distant observer) while the radiation emitted "backwards" will be correspondingly red-shifted. Since the blue-shifted radiation has shorter wavelength, it has more momentum, the net effect is a force on the source which tends to slow the rotation. (interestingly, the same effect is used at much lower energy levels to trap ultra-cold atoms in what is called "optical molasses"). The second effect is a bit more technical. The radiation which is emitted towards the poles of the pulsar has a property called "circular polarization" and a beam of circularly polarized light carries away angular momentum. 

The sunlight intensity is the cosine of the sun's elevation angle $\alpha$. How to calculate the position of the sun is described simply at PVEducation.com. To summarize the relevant equations: $\alpha$ is given by, $$\alpha = \arcsin[sin\delta\sin\phi+cos\delta\cos\phi\cos(HRA)]$$ where $\delta$ is the declination angle of the sun: $$\delta = -23.45^\circ \times \cos\left[\frac{360}{365}(d+10)\right]. $$ $\phi$ is the latitude, d is the day of the year (Jan 1 is 1), and HRA is the hour angle: $$HRA = 15^\circ(LST-12).$$ LST is the Local Standard Time. This should simulate the intensity of light hitting level surfaces throughout the year, however to be really natural one would have to change the position of the lighting (according to these equation) rather than the intensity because early morning and late evening mean a low sun to me rather than a low intensity sun. 

In the standard model, the universe looks the same for all locations moving in the local rest frame. This includes its apparent age. You can tell if you are in the local rest frame if the expansion of galaxies around you is symmetric in all directions and the microwave background also is the same in all directions. Simply put, any civilization on any galaxy in the visible universe would measure the same age of the universe that we do. If, however, some object managed to move at nearly the speed of light relative to its local rest frames, which would have been changing continuously, for a significant fraction of the age of the universe, there would be relativistic time dilation and that object would not have aged as much as the rest of the universe. That is, if there were a clock onboard, it would record less time elapsed. However, since doing this requires continuous accelerations and vast energy, no natural phenomenon that we know of could have experienced this. If an object accelerates to the speed of light and then cuts off its engines, then because of Hubble expansion, it will travel to locations where relative to the new local galaxies it is no longer going near the speed of light and hence the time dilation as seen by local observers drops off. Cosmologists usually use expanding coordinates, which expand in time with the global scale, to do calculations. In expanding coordinates this effect appears as a fictitious force (arising from the transformation of coordinate system) that acts to dampen velocities. 

The temperature of a black hole as seen from the outside is the temperature of the Hawking radiation, which @jyoti has discussed. The temperature you would experience as you fell freely through the event horizon, is a different question. I think the answer depends on what else is falling into the black hole at the same time. From its own viewpoint, everything that falls into a black hole reaches the singularity in a fixed maximum time (a few days for the very largest supermassive black holes) so you could only exchange energy with things that fell in around the same time as you did. If there was very little such stuff, then I don't think you'd notice anything out of the ordinary -- you'd be exposed to the cold of space, just as you were before (assuming the black hole is big enough that you haven't been heated up the tides of the black hole distorting you. On the other hand if lots of stuff was falling into the black hole with you then the whole lot would get churned up, and you'd be falling in as part of a mass of very hot plasma. Eventually, at least in a non-spinning black hole, you'd approach the singularity and be ripped apart by tides. 

It's spread out in time. If a source emits a 1W pule of energy lasting 1 second and the receiver is receding so fast that it is Doppler shifted to a frequency which means the power is just 0.5W, then the pulse will take 2seconds to arrive (since the end of it had further to travel).
