The simplest answer is exactly as Joe said: because them's the rules. Most rules relating to offensive formations are designed to help out the defense; it's generally understood that because the offense knows what they're going to do to try to move the ball and the defense doesn't, the defense is at a significant disadvantage in their job. To assist the defense and thus help balance the game to prevent every game being an offensive shootout, the offense must give certain cues as to their intentions based on how they position their side on the field. More specifically, the development of the "forward pass" in American football, differentiating it from most other games in the family which require laterals or rearward passes only, gives the offense a huge advantage in unpredictability. To balance this, the definition of a legal forward pass itself (especially the fact that it must not bounce off the turf; theoretically a lateral or rearward shovel pass can be bounced) as well as new rules regarding formation, give the defense a few clues about what the offense is planning, or at least how to attempt to defend it. The "seven down linemen" rule makes it easier for the defense to identify eligible receivers; players who may proceed beyond the line of scrimmage and then catch a pass from behind it. Essentially any player that takes a "three point stance" on the line of scrimmage is ineligible, and may neither be the first player to touch a forward pass nor may they proceed further than 3 yards downfield prior to the ball crossing the LOS. Now, the "seven down linemen" don't have to be the positions you'd expect (namely center, left/right tackles and guards, then a wide receiver on each end). The "two tight ends" formation is a very flexible one that plays with the typical expectations of a defense, putting all seven down linemen in the center of the formation allowing either or both of the tight ends to either block or move downfield for a pass attempt (or both). It allows for more running and short passing options than the 4WR formation, and allows a team to grind its way down the field 5-7 yards at a time simply by keeping the quarterback protected and the defense guessing. Here's one variation: 

To play golf, the first thing you need is a set of clubs. I will echo iandotkelly; used clubs are the beginner's best friend. People get rid of clubs all the time, either because they bought new ones or because they've had enough and are giving up the game. Look for local garage sales, check bulletin boards at local public courses, take a look at the 'List or the 'Bay, and check the "pre-owned" racks at local golf stores (Golfsmith deals heavily in used clubs from trade-ins at local stores). Judging by what I've seen, you should be able to put together a good set of clubs with bag for about $300 if you buy used clubs from a retailer. If you luck out at a garage sale or Craigslist listing, you could walk away with a full set of nice clubs for $25-$50 if the guy just wants to be rid of them. Contrasting that, buying a full set in a bag from a reputable brand like Adams or Macgregor will start at $500, and buying new components separately (driver, woods, iron set, wedges and putter) can easily run you over a grand. Don't do that until you know what you want in a set of clubs to fit your game (and are rich/interested enough to justify it). When assembling your clubs, the minimum you will want is a driver, 3-wood, a numbered iron set (typically from 3 or 4 through pitching wedge), a sand wedge and a putter. That's 11 to 12 clubs and will allow you to play from pretty much any lie. Once you identify the types of clubs you use best, or situations in which you don't have a good club for the job, you can add two or three clubs and look at replacing clubs in order to play to your strengths or fill in the gaps. Common additions are a 5-wood, for fairway shots where you'd normally use a hard-to-hit long iron; hybrids to replace long irons; and additional wedges to dial in the right distance in your short game. Things to look for in your first set of clubs: 

The curve of a cricket bat has several functions. First, it balances the bat, especially larger bats, by bringing the mass that's behind the "sweet spot" forward relative to the hands; a straight bat of a professional size and weight would have more mass behind the line indicated by the handle through the bat, and would be harder to maneuver. Second, the curve enlarges this "sweet spot" by increasing the surface area that's close enough to the center of mass to gain an advantage, and also by allowing the bat to "trampoline" the ball when hit towards the tip. Finally, it allows for a bit of finesse in various shots. The curved tip allows the batsman to more easily "pull" the ball with a side swing, hitting toward the opposite side of the field as would be expected (a right-handed batsman will typically "push" the ball to his right, much like a RHB in baseball will tend to do the same). It also allows for a better defensive swing (a swing made more to block). Such swings typically lead with the hands and the bat ends up angled downward and backward at impact. In this stance, the curve presents a steeper angle to the ball at impact, so that the ball will bounce downward more strongly instead of rearward, hopefully keeping it away from the wickets and keeper. 

So, it's custom to play out of turn in order to "clean up" a ball laying near enough to a hole that the player can be expected to hole out. Whether lifting or playing a ball close to the hole, players have to be careful not to disturb the line of play of other golfers; a soft green will retain marks from the golfer's spikes which can interrupt a ball's path, so golfers avoid placing their feet along the probable line of putt of another player. This can lead to some funky stances for tap-ins, which are specifically allowed as exceptions to Rule 16-1 (which otherwise prohibits a player taking a stance standing astride or with either foot on their line of putt) because they are taken specifically to avoid another player's line of putt. As Duncan says, in casual play, players whose balls are within some certain distance can, on approval by another player, pick up their ball and score the hole as if they would have holed out with their next stroke. It's called a "gimme", and it speeds casual play but it's technically a disqualification from a tournament for leaving a hole without having holed out. 

A similar case happened during the 1982 season, where five drivers (Didier Pironi, John Watson, Alain Prost, Niki Lauda, Rene Arnoux) shared the most number of wins with two wins each, while the eventual champion (Keke Rosberg) only had one. The circumstances behind the championship were quite bizarre, though, as Pironi suffered a career-ending accident during the German GP, five races before the end of the season. Before then, he was leading the championship comfortably. Compared to the multiple retirements and non-scoring finishes shared between the multiple race-winners, a consistent points haul throughout the season by Rosberg played a huge part in his title victory. 

Is there a record of who has had the worst first serve percentage during a singles match in a grand slam event? This question includes both men's and women's games. 

Aside from Charlie Whiting, the FIA Race Director, the race stewards who look at and deliberate on on-track incidents are apparently not the same every weekend. There have been races where I hear the Sky F1 commentators mention a few familiar names as part of the stewarding team, former F1 drivers like Emanuele Pirro and Nigel Mansell. Looking around the internet, the FIA website has published biographies for known race stewards of certain race events, but they all come from different backgrounds in the motorsport industry, some of them former FIA officials and some racing drivers. (see source) Is there any specific criteria for selecting race stewards? Does being a former F1 driver qualify you to be one? And did these people volunteer or are they a part of a collection of people that are assigned to be race stewards every race weekend? 

Taking a look at the last 3 years, the Atlanta Hawks (2014) and Memphis Grizzlies (2015) have had the lowest W/L percentage of all the teams that qualified for the playoffs in their respective years, both teams qualifying for the 8th seed in their conferences with a W/L percentage of 41.5% (34W-48L). My question is, what is the lowest win-loss percentage record for a team that has qualified for a playoff spot in NBA history? (Not including the lockout shortened seasons) 

Besides from their signature shoes, player jerseys are some of the most popular merchandise bought by fans. My question is, do players earn from the sales of replicas of their jerseys? 

The league fines players for flopping and flopping can also be grounds for a technical foul. While players have been fined for flopping in games throughout the past few years, I want to know if anyone's ever been suspended for repeated flopping offences? 

Sam Groth (263.4km/h) is 6'3" Albano Olivetti (257.5km/h) is 6'8" John Isner (253.7km/h) is 6'10" Ivo Karlovic (251km/h) is 6'11" Jerzy Janowicz (251km/h) is 6'8" 

Assists in basketball are counted as passes that directly lead to a scored basket. I've noticed players passing to their open teammates for a jumpshot, or throw up lobs for players cutting to the basket, but there are also times when I've seen assists count where the receiver takes a few steps after getting the ball before making a shot. My question is, how much time does a receiving player have to score for it to count as an assisted basket? 

In modern F1, race neutralization via Safety Car is done in two variations, the traditional SC Period, where the Safety Car actually goes out on track and collects the entire field to form a slow-running queue; and the new Virtual Safety Car where the drivers are simply required to run sector times that are over a specified Delta, effectively slowing them down as well. I understand that the VSC is meant to neutralize the race, slowing down the pace without bunching up the field, but still maintaining the gaps between the cars on track. Something similar to how Full Course Yellow works in WEC, only with the delta time replacing the speed limit. In case of on-track incidents that exceeds Yellow Flag conditions, how does the FIA decide which Safety Car procedure to use? 

Source If we extend the list to the top 10, the shortest player among them would be Roscoe Tanner, who stands 6'0". Is there any definite advantage that tall players have when it comes to serving the ball? 

Fastest laps are classified as the fastest time set around a particular race track during a Grand Prix, however, due to the new fuel rules in F1 that banned mid-race refueling, some of the fastest laps are hard to break, even though the cars set qualifying times that are faster than these set times. Take the Japanese GP at Suzuka for example, the recorded fastest lap around the circuit was a 1'31.540 by Kimi Raikkonen in 2005, but a faster 1'30.915 lap was done during qualifying by Mark Webber in 2013. A more recent qualifying vs race time comparison was during this year's Monaco GP. Daniel Ricciardo got pole on a 1'13.622 while the recognized fastest lap was a 1'17.939 by Lewis Hamilton. Why are Fastest Laps taken from the fastest race lap and not from the significantly quicker qualifying times? 

In 2008, the Seattle Supersonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder, but because Oklahoma City was still in the Western Conference, the NBA still had a balance of 15 teams per conference. Same case in 2012, when the Nets moved from New Jersey to Brooklyn which was also still in the Eastern Conference. What if the Sonics or the Nets moved to a location outside their respective Conferences and cause a conference to be short one team? What does the NBA do in this situation? Does the season continue as it is as long as there are at least 8 teams in each conference to take to the playoffs? 

Players are often seen challenging out calls/non-calls by the linesmen, but when the chair umpire makes a call correction, can a player still challenge the corrected call? 

Given that if athletes hold dual citizenship, they have the ability to compete for either nation. Has there been an instance of athletes who have competed for different countries during their career? (Excluding those who competed as Independent Athletes)
