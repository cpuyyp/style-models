The mathematical concept of superposition is not the same as not knowing. Schrodinger's cat is a frustrating topic for a novice in QM to explore because the whole reason Schrodinger invented it was to poke at the uncomfortable claims that the Copenhagen Interpretation required. Its job is to cause difficult questions to come forth. As for the cat, the Copenhagen Interpretation states that the cat is in a superposition of alive and dead until it is observed. Observation is a very nuanced concept in Copenhagen, which is not the same thing as us knowing or not knowing. It is closer to answering the question of whether or not the information exists to be known or not. Until the observation, that information does not exist. This is different from a simple "we don't know if we're alive or dead." Other interpretations have different solutions to this puzzle. Multiple-Worlds Interpretation, for instance, states that we can't objectively talk about the state of the cat, but we can talk about the combined state of the observer and the subject: "the observer's observed state of the cat will be consistent with the actual state of the cat." Pure quantum mechanics, without the aid of an interpretation to bring it into the more classical-framed ways of viewing the world, would argue that everything is part of a quantum mechanical "wave function." This function can be decomposed into superposed states, if desired, but that's about as far as it goes. To explore your question in this realm, we would have to dive deep into what does the "we" in "do we all exist" actually means. It turns out that it can be harder to pin down than you might like. It is a fun thought process to work through, but it's not the same as uncertainty about one's own death. 

If such a universal logical language exists, it would be subject to some very peculiar limitations which were developed by Alfred Tarski. His undefinability theorem puts some very interesting limitations on such a language. In particular he considered a language which: 

Curious what such a color might feel like? Some people claim that if they cross their eyes such that the crosses in the picture below overlap, they see yellow-blue, an impossible color. Of course, to go much further would start to explore the question of whether color is a "real" thing or an "illusion." Perhaps all colors are, indeed, imaginary. I make such a statement, of course, to tie the answer back to philosophy, but you have to admit that the cognative science side of the answer is rather fascinating! 

There is an inherent back pressure that comes from a doctrine like this. "That which is necessary is legal" presses back on the definition of "necessary." If there is a strong desire for an act to be illegal, there will be a corresponding strong desire for that act to be deemed "not necessary." If you apply this logic to "That which is necessary is moral," the backpressure gets extraordinarily strong. Questions of "is it necessary to remain alive?" arise. Consider the Samurai: in many situations the only moral course of action they had available was to commit ritualistic suicide. They did not have the luxury of assuming that living was a necessity. However, it does lead in an interesting direction to explore. This quote feels very similar to the attitude that there is always a moral path to follow, no matter how far one has strayed. Doctrines can be slippery at times. 

I have found two definitions used in my experiences. The first is "A scientifically compatible belief is one whose statements about the empirical world can be tested via the scientific method, and have yet to be falsified." I find this kind of definition is commonly used for dealing with beliefs which claim to be able to affect "the real world" (scare quotes included). As an example, there's a longstanding debate as to whether Chi (氣), a Chinese concept of energy, is real or not. Those who practice arts centered around it claim that it is real and can affect the world. The scientific community has steadily challenged empirical claims made by masters of these arts, and those (specific) claims have been falsified.¹ At the present, I find most non-practicioners of those arts consider chi to be "not scientifically compatible" because it's believers keep making empirical claims which get falsified by science. That definition tends to be more benign. It could be paraphrased as "as long as you don't claim things that science proves false, you're compatible with science." There is another definition I often run into which is more strict, and more metaphysical. The definition above relies purely on the strongest part of science: it's rigorous methodology. The second definition I run into a lot digs at the metaphysics of science: "A belief is scientifically compatible if all of its claims could be arrived at via a series of tests using the scientific method." This definition is stricter because it requires the belief to make no claims to truth which do not fit science's model of how we can view reality. It comes from an assumption that all meaningful knowledge can be acquired via the scientific method, so any knowledge which cannot be acquired in this way must be meaningless. Not everyone holds this opinion, but I find many do. This stronger definition would cause one to argue that the belief at the heart of Christianity is not compatible with science because many Christian groups believe that the Bible is the True word of God, and thus any statement made in the Bible is true. However, the Bible makes many claims which could never be tested via the scientific method. In particular, it contains one-time events such as the resurrection and the rapture which, being one-time events, are naturally untestable via a methodology which depends upon repetition and replication. This would cause someone who accepts the second definition to reject Christianity as "not scientifically compatible." Myself, I find that when I get into debates, the former definition is more popular, but it depends on the venue. The more fire-and-forget environments like social media are weighted more towards the second definition because it is incredibly good at dismissing contrary opinions, but more serious debates tend to favor the more conservative former definition. At least that is my (unscientific) experience. ¹ This often leads to fascinating debates as to what qualifies as falsification, and how seriously any given study should be treated, but I have not yet found any study on chi with positive results which has been generally accepted by the larger scientific community. 

There is an Archbishop lying in the grass, asleep. He is dreaming of a grasshopper sitting on his chest. Or is he? Perhaps it is the grasshopper that is asleep, dreaming of sitting on a Archbishop's chest. So which is real? The archbishop or the grasshopper? 

I would say that few philosophers would agree with that definition. Philosophy, from its linguistic origins in Greek, is "the love of wisdom" (φιλοσοφία). Calling the "love of wisdom" "appreciation of wise thoughts" is like saying the football fan who decorates his car in his team's colors and holds giant parties when his team makes it to key games is "someone who likes sports." It's an understatement to a sufficient degree that it becomes reasonable to question whether it is even a truth. Such phrasing is indeed useful if one is actively dismissing philosophy (as Ward is), but those who call themselves philosophers are highly unlikely to accept it. As a single example, I'd draw on my personal favorite philosopher Alan Watts. In his lectures, he provided his definition for a philosopher: 

You are not the only one to question the infinite myriad of numbers. In fact, there are entire schools of thought exploring the infinite spectrum of numbers, entire schools of thought exploring the transfinite numbers beyond the infinite spectrum, and entire schools of thought exploring how to do math where infinities do not exist (known as finitist schools of thought)! Fundamental to the discussion of infinite numbers is the concept of Peano arithmetic. Giuseppe Peano developed a set of axioms for the so called "natural numbers," which are informally defined to be the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4... The axioms are: 

Most people posing this question want not only an answer, but an explanation of why that is the answer. That explanation must always include a precise definition of "all-powerful." Many who are pushing for such an answer want not only an explanation, but something worthy of being called a "proof." Proof is actually a mathematical term, with a very precise definition. There are many classes of formal systems which can admit proofs, but First Order Logic (FOL) and Second Order Logic (SOL) are by far the most common. The individual posing the question will need to declare what sort of proof they accept. Since FOL and SOL are the most common systems people use, it is most likely they will name one of the two. FOL is the most commonly referenced formal system with regard for proofs (for reasons we will see in a moment). However, defining "all powerful" within the confines of the language FOL supports is tricky. FOL requires everything it will talk about (officially called the "domain of discourse") to be defined as a set. "All powerful" could be defined as "For-all things that can be done, Supreme-Being can do it," however defining a set of "things that can be done" which includes creation and lifting of this particular rock is not possible. You need to go one step further, using categories rather than sets before you can use such a phrase, but FOL simply doesn't do that. (if you want to go further into why this is true, look into the work of Bertrand Russel into paradoxes and set theory) SOL also works on a domain of discourse defined by sets. However, its semantics allow some clever structures which define categories using sets, construct the category which includes creation and lifting of the rock, and then you can go about your proof. At first glance, this looks like a winner! As part of building his incompleteness theorems Gödel demonstrated a major limitation of SOL. It turns out that it is impossible to make any proof about a SOL system unless it happens to be reducible to FOL (i.e. you claimed you were using SOL, but you never actually used any of its fancy abilities). We've argued that the set of things that can be done cannot be described in FOL, so Gödel proves that any result regarding creation and lifting of our rock cannot possibly be proven. The final answer is to allow admission of other formal systems besides FOL and SOL which can handle this particular case. However, in practice, the reason we use FOL and SOL is because it is remarkably hard to come up with a formal system which others can agree with. You can come up with any formal system you want, but unless both parties agree on what a "proof" should behave like, there really can't be any headway. So, in all, the anti-ontological argument itself is phrased using a language which is tremendously unfriendly to proofs. Anyone seeking a proof will find themselves bound by the language of the problem.
