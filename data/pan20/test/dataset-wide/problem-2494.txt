Here for example is a link to the Twelve Principles of Buddhism By Christmas Humphreys. They include (I summarize, see a reference for the more-complete text): 

It shows Buddhist proselytism reaching (beyond the Maurya empire) to Alexandria (which is in modern-day Egypt), and Antioch (modern Turkey). This may not be "expansion of Buddhism" though, it's more like "envoys from the Buddhist empire". 

Would it be possible to be mindful of discursive thoughts? The bodily and sensory mindfulnesses mentionned don't involve thoughts. Is mindulness only perceptual? "Inactive" needn't mean "mindless". I gather that "mindful" is supposed to mean "remembering" or "keeping in mind". I suppose that what you remember, bear in mind, keep in mind, is called "the object of meditation". Sometimes people use a visual object of meditation: a kasina, maybe a candle, or a mandala, or even a landscape, or wall. Or the object of a meditation might be metta bhavana (the development of metta). I notice that "object" (at least in English) can have two meanings: it's the immediate perceptible thing which you concentrate on and pay attention it; and "the object of something" can mean your purpose or goal, your reason for doing something. In metta bhavana I suppose it's both: you focus on metta in order to bring it into being. Anther type of meditation or mindfulness in Buddhism is "mindfulness with/when breathing" (anapanasati). I think that has two components, i.e. breathing and being mindful. To the extent that "mindful" means "remembering", though, I don't think that means "remembering to breath" -- I think it means more like, "remembering the object of meditation while being aware of breathing". Anapanasati is famous: people teach it. Perhaps it's taught in too much detail, e.g. in this answer I tried to answer a question just about the mechanics of "breathing long" (selecting quotes from one 500-page book about anapanasati in general). Forms of meditation are also described in the suttas (and elsewhere) and contemporary teachers (meditation centre, monasteries) teach in person. Another object of meditation, some else to take as the "object" of meditation, is "letting go" or "non-attachment" (see for example this answer, or the same texts in a bit more detail here). 

This is referring to the three poisons which are shown as being at the centre of the 'wheel of life'. My understanding, from the way they're represented/illustrated, is that they cause or feed each other. Wikipedia claims that ignorance is the root cause: 

I suppose that the Buddhist equivalent of a "sin" is klesha or kilesa. I suppose or it feels to me as if it probably is a sin, several sins: torpor (not doing something about it), ignorance (not knowing what to do about it), conceit (thinking that you could do something about it), hatred (not liking what you see)... Technically it's not breaking a precept: you're responsible for what you do, not for what other people do. But it's probably also right to find it questionable, if someone could have saved someone but didn't. 

In other words I think you're supposed to understand it, make sense of it, use it, not just believe it. 4. If enlightenment is just about grasping the 3 characteristics and experiencig them during meditation then even an "evil" person can become enlightenment. I'm not sure that enlightenment is just about grasping the 3 characteristics. I think it's more about the (two or) three poisons, the ten fetters, and so on -- see also Buddhist Paths to liberation. 5. Why does it take so long to become enlightenment if it is just about seeing the 3 characteristics? That reminds me of this sutta: 

This is exactly one of the topics (i.e. whether a Tathagata exists or doesn't exist after death, or both) which the Buddha "didn't declare" -- see the Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta (MN 63): 

... so maybe there are some definite ("100%") answers to this question, and/or maybe some guidelines. 

The article you posted (Arising to the Interconnectedness of Life? A Buddhist Perspective on the Occupy Movement) doesn't seem to me especially clear on the subject. IMO the clearest part of its message is to avoid seeing other people as Other and therefore behaving inhumanely. 

I don't think it's thoroughly explained in suttas. I know you tagged this topic lay-buddhism, but it might be relevant to mention that the topic is extensively discussed in the Vinaya (the "discipline", the rules for monks). Pages of 74 through 86 of The Buddhist Monastic Code says: 

First is the Sangha. If I have question about Buddhism, about what a sutta means, I'd want to look for some other peoples' opinions of it first, before my own. The sutta you quoted (AN 3.80) is not translated on AccessToInsight nor on Dharmafarer (though it is on SuttaCentral). I only infer from that they consider this sutta to be relatively unimportant, not the most essential sutta -- see also the topic Chronological or other sequence for beginners on this site. 

I get the impression that a materialist might say, "I exist because I have (or am) a body." And might say, "I will die (and not be reborn) when my body dies..." And might add, "... therefore I have no incentive to behave morally in this life." Conversely I think that the Buddhist definition of "self" has approximately four meanings: 

The conclusion to Buddhism and organ donation suggests that organ donation is compatible with Buddhism. If that's true, how is that compatible/reconciled with the view that the body should not be disturbed/touched after death? 

This answer is just my speculation, based on experience of medicine not based on Buddhist references. Isn't the whole point of becoming a Buddha to help others to attain enlightenment? I guess I don't understand your analogy. The way I think it works is, 

The 'Access to Insight' site, which I referenced immediately above, is a "Theravada Buddhism" site. So its views (the perspectives of the authors of its articles) about the "aim of Buddhism" aren't completely the same as those of other schools of Buddhism, hich are given in e.g. some other answers to this question. There are several Schools of Buddhism, so when you ask about it or when you "research Buddhism" you might want to be clear about which school you're researching; but see also Basic points unifying Theravāda and Mahāyāna. 

The Vanijja Sutta is the standard definition of "wrong livelihood" and is, as you saw, not specific. It says, in its entirety (at least in this translation), 

Is there a linguistic or philological basis for translating "dukkha" as "reactivity"? No I don't think so. Philologically I think of dukkha as being originally an antonym of sukha -- 

Where did Buddha says that "a beginning point is not evident"? If beginning point is not evident then the world has been manifesting since eternity. I'm not sure that "not evident" is meant to imply "infinite" or "since eternity". Even "5 minutes ago" isn't very evident, at least to me, "500 years ago" is even less evident, and "London and New York" are scarcely evident from here, etc. It may be better to consider what's akalika -- timeless, eternal, ever-present. If you're in a court of law and someone tells you that a fact is "not evident", I think that means that there's "no evidence": which I guess implies that it's a question that you cannot answer, perhaps therefore a wrong or useless question (unless you're adding some additional debatable context-specific assumptions, like "innocent until proven guilty" therefore "no evidence implies innocence"; or "everything that ever happened is evident" therefore "if it's not evident then it never happened"). Anyway that's how I reconcile ruben2020's answer ("from an inconstruable beginning") with Lanka's ("the cosmos is an imponderable"). I don't think it's meant as a cosmological or mathematical statement. 

Sometimes pictures are or have been an important part of teaching dharma (for example some people have used a picture of the Wheel of Life as the basis for a dhamma talk). And in the last paragraph of this answer Andrei mentioned teachers' using gestures for communication. Anyway there's a lot more to teaching than just text. But maybe not on this site, though, which is principally a text-based, English-language, question-and-answer site. 

Without wanting to be rude to the teachers, I'm quietly sympathetic to the latter statement, i.e. I too was not persuaded by the argument as an argument. Perhaps, if you want to accept it, you shouldn't see it as an argument, not as a proof, but rather as a description of what is. I learned (from my Physics teacher) that you choose a (scientific) theory because it's useful -- e.g. it isn't contradicted by observations, and it makes useful/accurate predictions about future observations. Sometimes there are different mutually-contradictory theories, which are useful in different circumstances (e.g. sometimes electrons are "like a wave" or sometimes "like a particle" depending on the type of experiment -- so you sometimes choose one theory and sometimes another, depending on which problem you're trying to solve, or which observation you're trying to explain). The Theory of Gravity for example is useful for predicting planetary orbits. It's not, so far as I know, any good at explaining why people love each other. I'd thus describe the Theory of Gravity as a "right view" when you're calculating planetary orbits ... and it's a "wrong view" when you're explaining why people love each other! So perhaps you shouldn't separate, can't afford to separate, the explanation from the reason for the explanation (i.e. its purpose, the use to which it will be put). The "developmental neurology" I mentioned ... I mentioned it because you asked about the origin or substantial cause of consciousness: and maybe that (the book I referenced) was a fair description of how "consciousness" might start, grow, develop. To that extent it may be a right view of the development of consciousness in a person. In my opinion, though, it's something of a "wrong view" from a Buddhist perspective: 

Rather than the "fifth precept", I find it stranger that it seems to transgress "right livelihood". Sankha's answer notwithstanding, I like to (I am happy to) see a statue of the Buddha if I walk into a restaurant. A few of the "10 bulls" commentaries imply that Buddhism and alcohol can, perhaps they hope, co-exist. For example, 

It's not clear what you mean by "pain" in the question. I assume that maybe you don't mean physical pain -- see e.g. Experiencing physical pain -- so maybe you mean something metaphorical. In that case you'd asking whether there's a difference between "metaphorical pain" and "suffering", which I think is quite vague. The Pali word that's translated as "suffering" is Dukkha (maybe we should define the dukkha and suffering tags to be synonyms). And actually dukkha doesn't mean exactly the same as suffering (so much so that people prefer to refer to it as "dukkha" instead of as "suffering"), so that's another way in which the question is inherently imprecise. 

Another sutta might seem to say something opposite, e.g. "Upaddha Sutta: Half (of the Holy Life)". Truth to tell, this sutta too wasn't about families; but anyway -- perhaps from personal experience if not from the suttas -- instead of (or as well as) concentrating on avoiding people who upset you, maybe try to find and try to emulate people you admire ... not to become attached, ideally, but to learn from a good example. That (learning from some good example[s]) is true for everyone, but maybe especially for people from dysfunctional families. IMO a problem with "dysfunctional families" isn't only that they're vexing but that you don't learn from them various ordinary coping skills. 

I think that maybe you can find statements from the Buddhist tradition, which are close to what you have in mind. For example Is That So? is an example of, "do not make excuses about what is said of you"; or The Taste of Banzo's Sword an example of, "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid". But I wanted to point out that the doctrine of the Pali suttas is comparable to, but, not the same as those Stoic statements. 

Getting back to the phrase question in the OP, "the meditation object is non-attachment", and comparing that phrase with the commentary n the Visuddhimagga, it seems that phrase is a good summary of "correct practise of Anapanasati": 

One of these things is not like the others: although I suppose that reproduction can be, however it does not have to be, considered a "survival drive" in the same category as food and drink. In particular I think that Buddhist dhamma sees food and drink as necessities, but not sex. Monks are expected to need food and drink, but to be celibate -- see for example this sutta for more details. 

So just let me know If I need reflect to person like a mirror or boomerang? I don't think so, no, because that sounds to me like you're suggesting making everything all about you: you might only see your own reflection, and not see them at all. If you were following the brahmaviharas, for example, then "equanimity" would have you see them, as "heir to their own kamma". Or (on the subject of relection like a mirror), sutta #17 from Non-violence -- A Study Guide shows how the Buddha reacts to hatred or insults -- i.e. he doesn't accept the insults offered to him. 

Why Buddha was not worried about his family after enlightenment? There's a section titled "Celibacy versus Responsibility" towards the end of this article, A Happy Married Life. Here are some excerpts: 

So perhaps they adopted the gesture from that milieu (or vice versa): i.e. from European students and young ecologists. 

The "five clinging-aggregates" which are listed above correspond to the five skandhas. Buddhism teaches that what we normally think of as "our self" is actually five different skandhas (a skandha translates as "aggregate, mass, or heap" in English); the five skandhas being, 

I don't know what "living in the Matrix" means (although I've seen the movie). I'm not a psychologist -- is it Dissociation, Depersonalization, Derealization, or something like that, that you think you're feeling? 

According to the Visakhuposatha Sutta, the reason for the Eight Precepts is that Arahants refrain from music etc.: 

Buddhism has the idea of the three jewels: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. You said "I believe in Buddha and his philosophy" so that's two of them, i.e. Buddha, and Dharma. There are parts e.g. in the Dhammapada which suggest it's better to be alone than with a fool: 

I don't know if this helps to answer, but I take it as axiomatic that there are bad actions, bad intentions, bad habits, bad environments ... but not "bad people". If a child bites one of their class-mates, for example, the teacher shouldn't say "you're a bad boy": they should say "don't bite people", or, "use your words instead of biting", or something like that. I think that Buddhism might tend to discourage adults from thinking you're "a person" at all of any kind, good or bad. And I think that a question to ask is not, "Am I a bad person?", it is, "Is this good behaviour? Good intent?", and so on. 

... might even imply the opposite about zazen: that the act, or outward form, of sitting is not sufficient. 

I'm not sure why "going to a movie" might help a person to "forget their pain". Perhaps it's just the passing of time (impermanence of pain), or distraction (to stop clinging), or human contact (your company at the theatre, or compassion felt for the characters in the movie). Without saying that a movie is unwise, perhaps using conversation to touch on these topics or evoke them is a skillful alternative. 

There appears to be a copy of that paper here ... which analyses the grammar and compares it to other suttas in which the Truths are described. Reading that paper might inspire several insights: e.g. that it's difficult to translate Pali accurately; that people have put a lot of work into trying to translate them; that maybe we should have some humility in asserting which is the 'right' translation, and/or "know the truths for ourselves" and not depend only on scholars. I think this paper concludes that "Noble truth" is maybe a later addition to the sutta: that the phrase "dukkha·samudaya" (origin of suffering) later became known as "dukkha·samudaya ariyasacca" (noble truth of origin of suffering), and that the new phrase became used even in places like the one you mentioned where it isn't appropriate (not appropriate because, as you said, it's not truth that's to be abandoned).
