The tiger is described with military and industrial language. It was constructed in furnaces, on anvils, with hammers and chains and ropes ("And what shoulder, & what art, / Could twist the sinews of thy heart?"). Unlike the lamb, the tiger is a weapon of war, adapted for killing. But even though we've just spent four stanzas wondering what immortal being could possibly have crafted a weapon of war as fearsome as the tiger, the fifth stanza suddenly admits the possibility that it was the same being who made the gentle and innocent lamb, ending with the line "Did he who made the Lamb make thee?" The last stanza repeats the first stanza, but this time instead of asking who "Could frame thy fearful symmetry", it asks who "Dare frame thy fearful symmetry". The narrator is implying that God, who made the Lamb, is perfectly capable of also creating the Tiger, but wonders that he dared to do it. 

He also doesn't spin Amira's "ball so the men can find husbands" suggestion into a competition for her hand--in fact, Amira is the one who brings up the idea of her being a prize in a contest. So, what could he mean? My suggestion (though it's a guess only, of course): the king could marry Amira himself. This meets all his requirements, would almost certainly be considered "unspeakable" by Amira (and disgusting by Tabitha, when she reacts later), and is a motif found in several other fairy tales. Donkeyskin and The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter are two of the most prominent, but there are a variety of stories that involve this--usually because the daughter is the only one beautiful enough to fulfill some sort of condition. However, as this story is pretty explicitly about the patriarchy and various people's roles in it, I think it makes sense that the king's reasoning would be changed a little here, especially as he's shown to take pity on and emphasize with the men re his daughter's "irresistibility," as well as to meld with the other tales more seamlessly. 

While the new church is seen as the destructive force which bulldozed the remainder of that history, "obliterating" the graves of local families and retaining no record of the original chapel. Jude is thus someone who is likely to have doubts about the efficacy of prayer as a means of getting things done, turning to it only because it is a socially accepted norm. By offering the suggestion that the only reason for the failure of prayer is due to a man's trousers (breeches) being made by a "wicked Jew", Hardy is ridiculing the notion that prayer works at all. The inclusion of the word "wicked" is as a shorthand to highlight both the non-Christian nature of the Jewish tailor and the idiocy of the suggestion that trousers are sufficient to cause a prayer to fail.

On a deeper level, the pair of "The Lamb" and "The Tyger" can represent a person attaining an adult, intellectual understanding of God and the nature of the world. God loves the little children, his little innocent lambs frolicking in their fields and knowing not how to do evil. To them "He is meek & he is mild". He is the God of love from the New Testament, who "calls himself a Lamb" and "became a little child". But the adult is closer to the tiger, capable of war, killing, and sin more broadly; and sometimes sinful adults meet the Old Testament God who smote Sodom and Gomorrah, the vengeful and destructive force who "smiled his work to see" when "the stars threw down their spears / And water'd Heaven with their tears". The second stanza also offers some support for this reading: 

So, it's reasonable for no one to say "here's how Susan is reacting to the death of her whole family", given that, well, her family doesn't know they all died. They expect to go back to our world. The last time they saw Susan, they were all alive and Susan was "silly." (Note: Lewis's opinion, not mine, etc.) The omnicient narrator doesn't bring it up at the time because at that point, the reader is also not supposed to know this. The revelation that they're in Heaven doesn't happen until the very, very end of the novel (literally the second to last paragraph), at which point there's enough grand-scale wrapping up to do, and enough on the characters' mind, that the narration doesn't return to Susan. 

The phrase is purposefully biblical and is used to denote Gatsby's inflated but empty ego. First, let's provide a dictionary definition of the unusual word "meretricious". 

Crow Communes is a parody of the Christian rite of communion, where the celebrants consume bread and wine and believe that it either represent or mystically becomes the flesh and blood of Christ. In the poem Crow literally eats a piece of God. The Crow poems are a cycle, and it's worth considering what has come before this ghastly communion. God has been trying to teach Crow to be more human, to understand love. The result is merely horror, symbolic of religion's failure to elevate humanity to peace and contentment. God has given up and is asleep at the start of this poem. In this context, then "under hearing beyond understanding" attempts to describe the metaphysical nature of what Crow is attempting to gain. Religious insight cannot be taught - it is "beyond hearing". And, like most mystical experiences, it is based on sense and emotion more than logical comprehension - it is "beyond understanding". Instead of rationality, Crow's communion reveals a more sentimental insight. "What is happening to crow" is that he has, finally, gained some of the insight that God was trying to teach him (futilely - see above) in the previous poems. It is, however, of limited use. After the revelation crow is described as a hierophant: 

(Please note: I'm not a expert in Christian/Lewis in particular's theology; this is my impression primarily from the text of the book.) Peter, Edmund, Lucy and the rest don't know they're dead until the very end of The Last Battle. At the time the discussion of Susan occurs, everyone--including the reader--thinks they simply were pulled through another portal to Narnia, right before, during, or instead of the crash. Peter thinks that Susan didn't come with them because she's no longer a friend of Narnia and didn't come on the train + through the portal with them, not because she's still alive. (The real reason is both, of course.) 

That's why The Last Battle doesn't bring it up. Re Lewis: presumably, Susan grieved for her family. She may even have turned to religion in her grief, which would bring her back towards the path to Aslan's country, though Lewis said would be a longer journey for her. However, that doesn't change the fact that the reason she's still alive is that she's, erm, a teenager who likes nylons and lipsticks rather than Aslan--that's what makes her "silly" according to Lewis, that state of mind; not her reaction to a specific event. 

We live in an age of renewed international conflict. Paper maps control where the winners think the borders lie. This is an interesting stanza because while a paper map can't really lie about where rivers and mountains are, these natural features are juxtaposed with artificial ones, road and rail. 

It is worth noting that the working title of the novel was "Responsibility". (Minor spoilers follow) How, then, does this tie in to the lack of a firm ending? The tragedy that culminates the novel stems from the judgements made against the Weedon family: with more support, Crystal would not be left desperate for love and affection, nor in charge of her little brother. But the ultimate failure is one of responsibility: society has failed in its responsibility for the Weedons, and Crystal herself has failed her personal responsibility for her sibling. The message Rowling wants to send, then, is that failing responsibility results in tragedy. She wants this message to be bleak and unflinching so as to mirror her own experiences at the sharp end of British society. She is unwilling to offer the reader easy answers to hard questions. All of these things are achieved by the open-ended, unsatisfying nature of the ending: by failing to provide a hard climax she is telling her reader that these squalid tales and tragedies will continue, until people and politicians finally start to live up to their responsibilities.
