I add another proof separately since it is rather different. It is based on the observation that an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ on a field $F$ gives rise to a field structure on $F^n$, compatible with the vector addition (just quotient out polynomials with coefficients in $F$ by the maximal ideal generated by the irreducible). Then the FTA is a consequence of the non-existence of real commutative division algebras in dimension greater than $2$. This last assertion follows from the observation that in such a $R^n$ you can define an $exp$ which gives an epimorphism $R^n\rightarrow R^n$ \ $0$, and hence a homeo $S^j \times R^k\cong R^n$ \ $0$, which is forbidden by a fundamental group computation (this was in Andrea Ferretti's notes). In fact you can use this argument to prove that any real irreducible polynomial has degree $1$ or $2$. 

This is a reference request question. I would like to know more on the structure of low dimensional nilpotent lie algebras. I heard that up to dimension 6 there are only finitely many isomorphism classes, and every such algebra admits a gradation with only positive degrees (see $URL$ Do you know of any source where I can find the corresponding proofs? 

I was told that a polynomial group law on (all of) $\mathbb{R}^n$ gives automatically a nilpotent (Lie, of course) group. Is it true? Where can I find a proof? A counterexample for open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is furnished by the halfplane with the $ax+b$ law. 

Every differential geometer should read at least the first two volumes of Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry. In particular, volume 2 is an absolute gem. Not only does it reprint (translations of) original papers by Gauss and Riemann, complete with very enlightening notes and commentary, but (if I remember correctly) Spivak presents about 5 or 6 different proofs that a Riemannian manifold is flat if and only if it is locally isometric to Euclidean space. This gives the reader the best, most intuitive grasp of the concept of curvature that I have seen anywhere. (I am a firm believer in learning by repetition...) 

Since you are so early in your career, in my opinion you are much better off leaving the paper where it is and hopefully it will be published soon. It's possible that you could have initially aimed higher, but because the refereeing process can sometimes take 6 months or even a year, you definitely don't want to withdraw it now- it could delay acceptance and publication by a long time. Even if you get a favourable referee's report, there's no guarantee that resubmitting it to a better journal will result in a favourable report. At your stage, it's better to get papers accepted and published, even if they're at lower-rank journals, than to be waiting over a year for a decision by a better journal. 

This is probably closer in spirit to what you're looking for than what you've received in the comments. If $(V^{2m}, J, \omega, g)$ is Calabi-Yau (which for me means that $J$ is integrable, and the first Chern class $c_1(V) = 0$), then one can say much more. In this case there exists a holomorphic nowhere vanishing $(m,0)$ form $\Omega$, called the "holomorphic volume form." The form $\Omega$ is unique up to multiplication by a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function. We don't need to assume that $\Omega$ is parallel, but Yau's theorem does tell us (if $V$ is compact) that we can change the metric, keeping the Kaehler class $[\omega]$ unchanged, to make $\Omega$ parallel (and consequently also the new metric will be Ricci-flat.) But I have digressed. In such a situation, if $L$ is Lagrangian, then it is well known that the restriction of $\Omega$ to $L$ is equal to $e^{i \theta} \mathrm{Vol_L}$, where $\mathrm{Vol}_L$ is the volume form of $L$ (with the induced metric) and $e^{i \theta}$ is the "phase" of the Lagrangian, where $\theta : L \to \mathbb R/ (2 \pi \mathbb Z)$ is a smooth, multivalued function on $L$. In addition, the mean curvature $H$ of $L$ in $V$ is given by $H = J \nabla \theta$. So the minimal Lagrangian submanifolds (vanishing mean curvature) correspond to those with constant phase function $\theta = \theta_0$. In this case, if $L$ is compact, then the volume of $L$ is given by $\mathrm{Vol} (L) = \int_L \mathrm{Vol}_L = \int_L e^{-i \theta_0} \Omega = e^{- i \theta_0} [\Omega] \cdot [L],$ which is topological. (It looks complex, but it's actually real, because $[\Omega]$ is a class in $H^g(V, \mathbb C)$.) If you prefer, you can just replace $\Omega$ by $e^{- i \theta_0} \Omega$ to get rid of the phase factor. Such "minimal Lagrangian" submanifolds, whose volume is purely topological, are also called special Lagrangian submanifolds, and are widely studied in calibrated geometry and differential geometric approaches to mirror symmetry. The best place to start looking is the text "Riemannian Holonomy Groups and Calibrated Geometry" by Dominic Joyce and its multiple references. I'm not sure how much of this will extend to the case of $J$ non-integrable and $c_1(V) \neq 0$. I'd have to think about it. 

There's an explicit example in dimension 2 or more, i.e.: sqrt(1-|x|^2) on the unit disc. This is the Bochner-Riesz multiplier (for delta = 1/2). The divergence of the derivative on the boundary of the disc is exactly what was needed. 

I was thinking about the Gelfand-Naimark theorem asserting the isometric * isomorphism between a commutative C* algebra (with unit) A and the C* algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on its spectrum (via the Gelfand transform). Explicitly: let spec(A) denote the spectrum of A and C(X) the algebra of complex continuous functions on X. Then spec and C define contravariant functors from commC* alg to CompHausTop, which (correct me if i'm wrong) establish an equivalence between the two categories. Gelfand-Naimark theorem has a non-commutative analogue, which is based on the so-called GNS construction and which shows that every non commutative C* algebras has a faithful isometric *-representation on a Hilbert space H. In this case I can't see an analogue of the preceding equivalence of categories, which is equally meaningful. Does it exist? 

I believe the following almost rigorous argument gives a positive answer. Continuous compactly supported functions are in L^1 and so their Fourier Transform (FT) is bounded. So everything depends on the behaviour at infty. Observe that the characteristic function of a bounded interval is not (absolutely) integrable, being "almost" sen(y)/y. Since decay at infinity of the FT reflects regularity of the function, if you strenghten continuity to C^k (k=2 is okay), you get immediately integrability fo the FT. The continuous case is intermediate between the discontinuous and regular one. If you look to a counterexample, it's better looking at non differentiable functions. A good choice could be a function smooth apart from a single point x where the "tangent" to the graph is vertical and f(x) is not 0. I believe an application of the stationary phase principle should give a decay y^-1 and so the non integrability of FT(f). I hope to provide more details later. 

Here's another great one: a certain well known mathematican, we'll call him Professor P.T. (these are not his initials...), upon his arrival at Harvard University, was scheduled to teach Math 1a (the first semester of freshman calculus.) He asked his fellow faculty members what he was supposed to teach in this course, and they told him: limits, continuity, differentiability, and a little bit of indefinite integration. The next day he came back and asked, "What am I supposed to cover in the second lecture?" 

Just to follow up on Eric's correct answer: when you have an almost complex structure $J$, you can decompose $1$-forms into type $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Locally, you can find a local basis $e^1, \ldots, e^n$ of $(1,0)$-forms, but these are not of the form $dz^1, \ldots, dz^n$. Indeed, as Eric mentioned, we do not have local holomorphic coordinates. Then $\bar e^1, \ldots, \bar e^n$ are a local basis of $(0,1)$ forms. Now if we compute $de^i$, it is a $2$-form, so it can be written in the form \begin{equation*} de^i = a^i_{jk} e^j \wedge e^k + b^i_{jk} e^j \wedge \bar e^k + c^i_{jk} \bar e^j \wedge \bar e^k. \end{equation*} The almost complex structure $J$ is integrable if and only if all the $c^i_{jk}$'s are zero. 

(I decided to repost multiple comments as an answer. It's partly an answer if I understand the OP correctly.) I think the OP does not necessarily want to conclude that these "local" forms are the restrictions of a global form. Rather, he wants to "glue" them together in the sense of "glueing" constructions used to solve elliptic PDE's, such as the Kummer construction of Calabi-Yau metrics on K3. That is, the OP (I think) wants to interpolate between these forms, and on the interpolation region the new globally defined form need not restrict to the original local pieces. Gary, is this indeed what you meant? If so, it sounds very difficult in general. If you have only a few charts with topologically simple intersections (like annuli), then this is often possible with cutoff functions, but topological obstructions can and do arise. Ideally, one has to be able to match the cohomology classes of your local Kahler forms $[\omega_i]$ on the intersection regions. If they do not match already, "corrections" are sometimes possible. It's rather nontrivial in general. Before saying more, I would need more details about the specific situation. 

First, $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$ has an infinite cyclic direct summand for every $k \geq 1$. As a simple example, you can think of $\pi_3(S^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, coming from the Hopf fibration. We recently wrote a paper where we solved a problem, which is closely related to your question. Namely, we give an algorithm which for a given finite simply connected simplicial complex $Y$, and a given $d \geq 2$, under some technical conditions on $Y$ the algorithm outputs for every generator $\alpha \in \pi_d(Y)$, a simplicial map $f_\alpha : \Sigma^d_\alpha \rightarrow Y $, where $\Sigma^d_\alpha$ is a simplicial complex whose geometric realisation is homeomorphic to $S^d$. In particular this works for spheres. You can find the paper on archive ($URL$ and it will soon appear in the SODA 2018 proceedings. The complexity of the algorithm is singly exponential on the number of simplices of $Y$, and we show that this is optimal. The way we prove it is by constructing an example $X$ where the necessary size of the spheres $\Sigma^n_\alpha$ is exponential on the size of $X$. That shows that any general algorithm must necessarily have at least singly exponential complexity. However, we do not work with barycentric subdivisions, but with a rather specific and non-canonical (if I might put it so) triangulations of the $d$-sphere. The construction of those was invented by Clemens Berger in his PhD dissertation ($URL$ - in French only). We believe that one could be able to fit those "non-canonical" models into an iterated barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a standard simplex. If this is true, it would mean that you need to subdivide $\partial \Delta[m+1]$ enough times to fit the exponentially large spheres produced by our algorithm, and you would be able to represent any homotopy element you wish. On the other hand, even though our algorithm is exponential in the general case, it might happen that it runs in polynomial time for some very specific spaces. For example. It is not impossible that this turn out to be true for spheres, but I cannot say much more about it. There is also another point of view. Spheres are compact Riemannian manifolds and you can rephrase your question in the language of Lipschitz constants. In this language, your question roughly translates to "what Lipschitz constants can one expect from representatives of homotopy groups of spheres". There is a connection between the Lipschitz constant of a Lipschitz function and the fineness of a triangulation required to homotope it to a simplicial map. This is somewhat expected because both notions measure some sort of geometric complexity of the function in mind. In particular, there is the following result by Gromov ($URL$ Theorem (Gromov): Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact simply connected Riemannian manifolds. Then $$\# \{ [f] \in [X,Y] \, : \, Lip(f) \leq L \} = O(L^\alpha)$$, where $\alpha$ depends only on the rational homotopy type of $X$ and $Y$. You can check also this ($URL$ paper from Weinberger and Ferry. There is a long study of similar questions from that point of view. I hope my comments are useful. In conclusion I would like to say that you question is very deep and very hard. 

For the standard model, and in particular for its representation-theoretic aspects (which are crucial), I would refer you to the excellent recent article by John Baez and John Huerta from the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society which can be found here: $URL$ There are also references to other articles and books here that could lead you further. If you are interested more generally in quantum field theory and its description for mathematicians (where differential geometry plays a big role, in addition to representation theory), then there is the infamous 2-volume "Quantum Field and Strings: A course for mathematicians" which is written by (mostly) mathematicians. It's not going to necessarily give you the correct physical insight, however. Here are the links: Volume 1 Volume 2 Other good possibilities are Freed-Uhlenbeck's "Geometry of Quantum Field Theory" from the PCMI (Park City) series, or the gargantuan "Mirror Symmetry" from the Clay Math monographs. 

José is correct, with the caveat that Gunnar mentioned - you need simple-connectedness to know that reduced holonomy = holonomy. Below I expand a bit more on the details. [Thanks to Tim Perutz for catching errors in the initial version of this answer.] Notice that the OP did not ask for $\Omega$ to be parallel or even closed. The following is true: If $(M, J, g, \omega)$ is Ricci-flat Kaehler, then the image of the first Chern class $c_1 (M)$in $H^2 (M, \mathbb R)$ vanishes, so that if $\pi_1(M) = 0$, then $H^2(M, \mathbb Z)$ has no torsion, and thus the canonical bundle $\Lambda^{n, 0} (M)$ is topologically trivial. So there exists a nowhere vanishing smooth $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ that trivializes the canonical bundle. By consideration of type, $\Omega \wedge \overline \Omega$ is a nonvanishing $(n,n)$-form, so by rescaling $\Omega$ by a nowhere vanishing complex valued function, one gets for "free" the identity that $$ \frac{\omega^n}{n!} = (-1)^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \Omega \wedge \overline \Omega.$$ Since $\Omega$ is type $(n,0)$ and the complex structure is integrable, then $\Omega$ will be holomorphic (and thus the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial) if and only if it is closed. Since $M$ is Ricci-flat, the Bochner theorem tells you that an $(n,0)$ form is closed if and only if it is parallel, which would give you holonomy contained in $SU(n)$. Compactness is needed to go the other way: Yau's theorem says that if $M$ is compact Kaehler and $c_1 (M) = 0$, then there exists a unique Ricci flat Kaehler metric in each Kaehler class. There are noncompact examples where uniqueness fails. I don't know as much as I should about the literature on existence in the noncompact case, but the papers of Tian-Yau should have the answer. A good elementary reference is Chapter 6 of Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy by Dominic Joyce.
