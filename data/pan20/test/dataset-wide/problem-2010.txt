You've learned something that some leads and programmers turned managers never learn - leading a team, even in an arena you are familiar with, takes a very different skill set than being a superstar programmer. In fact many of the things that can make someone a 'superstar' programmer are detrimental in a leader. The other answers bring up an excellent point. Do you want to be lead? Or are you doing it because it's the 'next step' in a standard career ladder? If you want to be a tech lead or start transition to a more managerial position then a couple of things should happen. First - I'm of the opinion that a brand new tech lead should almost never be placed on a brand new project. Good companies wouldn't consider letting a dev 1 loose on a complex, from the ground up, business central project without a ramp up period and mentorship. But somehow when it comes time to make folks tech leads they're more than willing to do that. What mentorship and leadership training has been made available to you? Have you taken advantage of it? If there isn't any I would begin by requesting some - entering management is a whole new field. Tech leads bring with them excellent tech skills but they often need mentoring and assistance in making the transition to a managerial style. The other option is that you decide you don't want a formal leadership position. There's nothing wrong with this. You may find it hard to step down from your current position and remain at your current company, you may not. Finally - I think you should consider that technical lead should not, in most cases, mean project lead. If you were assigned to lead a project, on your own, as tech lead without a project manager that would definitely make things more difficult than they should be. In this case it sounds like you should talk to your bosses and try to find out what they think 'technical lead' means. In my experience it means a head programmer who pushes the direction of them implementation and standards of the desired product. 

It is almost never a good idea to throw someone under a bus. Even when they deserve it and, to be honest, it doesn't sound like your coworked deserved it. At least it also doesn't sound like a very big bus either. It's not fair to say but no one likes a whiner. In most workplace cultures in the modern world no one wants to hear "But I could have done it better except ~Bob~ screwed up!" Especially when it's not a specific thing you can point to ("Bob dropped trou and started waving his genitals at the clients..." is something you can point to, "Bob was ineffient" isn't so much something concrete.) This isn't to say you shouldn't discuss your challenges with your supervisor. You absolutely should and if 'Bob' is a jerk who refuses to do any work then you should spend some time discussing this and getting advice for better ways to handle it. The time to do something like that, though, isn't in your yearly evaluations. Your yearly evaluations should be about you and what you did or didn't do. It's ok, and in fact should be good, to be honest and say "I struggled with this" or "This thing happened and I didn't know the best way to handle it". But once you start bringing in other people's names(with the caveat that as management this changes a bit) then you've pulled the focus off of you and onto your relationship with this person OR, even worse, onto this person entirely. That being said it's water under the bridge at this point. You can't go back and change the past. It may be worthwhile, depending on your relationship with you manager, to ask for a moment and roughly talk about what you've mentioned here. Something like "Hey, I was reflecting on our conversation during my yearly eval and I feel I may have spoken inappropriately. Coworker 'Bob' is an awesome coworker because reasons and I don't want you to have the impression that bad stuff is the only thing I think about. Additionally I've come up with better answer to your question. What do you think?" There are all lessons we learn the hard way and this, honestly, doesn't sound like a huge deal. But if I were you I'd keep it in mind. The most successful people I know build others up around them, they don't tear them down or throw them under buses. Keep this in mind for the next time you end up with a panic inducing question during an eval so you can breath, take a moment and answer it in a way that will best characterize you. 

"Tell me what happened..." "Well Bobby Sue was dancing on the table top, because he's a giant man baby, and Billy Joe was humping the stuffed camel in the corner. Brandy got that camel while she was in Japan. I don't really know why she got the camel but it was right after she broke up with Billy Joe. And between Sally Jesse, Jamie Joe and Stu there were doing some weird version of the macarena. And then a customer drove through the shop window and Suzanne spat her drink out all over Stan's nice suit. It was a really nice suit he got it at..." There's a lot of information in that pseudo report above. And to the person saying it, it all seems important. But the reality is the person asking the question was probably hoping for less information about the stuffed camel and more information about the car driving through the shop window. Things like the time, who was there, was anyone injured, was anything damaged. A free form report leaves a lot of room for the imagination, if that's the word. They leave room for the question answerer to decide what is and is not important. They leave room for 'colourful' commentary. If a company is hiring a lawyer to evaluate an incident, a common response, then there may be things that come up during these colorful reports that people don't really want investigated. Drama or vendettas may come up. And, perhaps most commonly, a lot of kruft is introduced to your data, a lot of stuff that isn't really useful or important. The long and short of it is that forms allow for consistency in reporting and ease of consumption. If an incident cannot be captured by a form it may be valuable to attach an additional written comment on the issue but, for the most part, issues can be broken down into a general 'who, what, where and when' at least for the first pass. 

References should be folks who have a great view of your current, impressive work. Using references who you have only stayed in contact with for the purpose of them being a reference sort of defeats the purpose of a reference. Instead of thinking of a person as a 'reference' you should think of them as a peer or a contact. You should stay in contact with folks whose work and interests mirror, complement or supplement your own. That's not to say you don't send holiday cards to your old boss from 5 years ago. But that IS to say that no matter how influential or cool they may be, they're not a good reference if they haven't had meaningful interactions with you and your work within the last, say, year. A year is a pretty arbitrary amount of time to be honest. What matters is that it is recent enough that that person can talk to your skills, strengths and experiences. If that person has the memory of a goldfish and can't say more than "Yeah FreakyDan was pretty cool" then that's not a great reference. If, say, you helped land a person on the Moon and that person can remember your contributions then a couple of years ago isn't unreasonable. But let's be honest, most of us and most of our accomplishments aren't as memorable as helping land someone on the moon. With that in mind, it makes sense to use as references those who are close enough to your work and to whom that work is fresh in their experiences. The trick, then, to keeping cool and influential people in your list of potential 'references' is to stay engaged in projects, events or activities that involve those people beyond your time at a company. Consider open source projects, volunteer events or other non-work specific activities as a way of growing and maintaining your pool of potential references. This also opens things up a bit when it comes time to naming references... I think it's important and valuable to have diversity in your references. What does that mean? If a prospective employee Bob has only references from one job/company and prospective employee Sue has references from several different organizations/companies/events. Then Sue looks and sounds more impressive. References aren't the end all be all. Honestly, most of the jobs I've gotten and most of the candidates I've reviewed - references are rarely if ever contacted. This is different depending on the job level(if you don't have a lot of experience references can be a bigger deal, also management jobs tend to be more interested in references) as well as field(my friends in the health care field get their references called way more often than I do) and region/customs where the company is located. 

There are many reasons that a particular format may be required for some data. It may be a regulatory thing, it may be a consistency thing, it may be that your coworker is a jerk. I, personally, wouldn't be so quick to jump on that last reason though... typically people have a reason for what they do and why they do it. You find it silly to duplicate work but the question should be: Why does it need to be in that format for that worker? Why does it need to be in your format of choice for you? The easiest solution would be to automate something that takes your report and dumps the data into their desired format. Sure it's a little bit of work but it's the least stressful way of handling the situation plus it shows flexibility and ambition on your behalf. A more reasonable solution, perhaps, would be to start a dialog. What is it about this coworker's format that is important to them? How is it fundamentally different from the report you already generate? What resolution can you two come to as peers to solve the issue? It could be as simple as a different layout. Alternatively, if your coworker is willing to redo the data to fit their needs - let them do it! It sounds, right now, like you, at least, have made this personal and that is never a healthy way to resolve issues like this. You should take a step back and really identify the issue here. Is it that you need different things? Is it that you are frustrated a peer isn't happy with a change you made? Is it something else? 

As has been mentioned by other posters, moving out is one of the only true solutions to this problem. I understand that both culturally and economically this can be tough so let's explore a couple other options. You don't mention much about the money arrangement with your family - are you paying rent? Are you assisting in paying for goods/services that you use? Some families this isn't a big problem. The child is the parent's child and housing/goods/support comes naturally. BUT not paying for things can make it very hard for some parents to distinguish between 'underaged child playing video games' and 'adult child with a job'. Additionally it sounds like things are fairly chaotic - you may be asked to mow the lawn this day, pick someone up that day... Start setting schedules in advance. If mowing the lawn is something you do to help the family then make the plan that "I mow the lawn every other Saturday if the weather is fine" and "If the weather is bad I may skip a week but I will catch it up on the next Saturday. I will mow the lawn twice a month." How about "I will pick up my sibling from school on Wednesdays". When people have plans it's much easier to stick to other schedules. Because, let's face it, with you at their beck and call why would your parents change anything? You have trained them(and they have trained you) that when they want something to happen during the day you will drop your job(and how can they take it seriously if you are willing to put it aside to go mow the lawn?) and do whatever it is they asked. I think that point is worth a bit of repeating - If someone is willing to put their job aside to do chores, then others will respect that job(and that person) less. It's just the way most cultures think about jobs. Important jobs, the line of thought goes, are jobs that you cannot step away from to do chores. Ergo those who can step in and out of the office willy nilly aren't doing 'real jobs'. At the end of the day your question is a lot less about workplace and a lot more about negotiating both generational differences and the transition between child and adult in your parent's eyes. Ultimately you would be best served by gaining distance in some way. If you are unwilling or unable to move out(which is understandable) another good way to get this distance would be to start working from somewhere else. Depending on where you live there are co-working locations in many cities/towns/communities. For a small membership fee you can go in at almost anytime to work and have a reserved space/office/equipment. Alternative options might be renting a room from somewhere/someone in order to work out of it or working from a library or cafe. In the end the only solution that will change anything will require several different things from your end: Make a schedule and keep to it regarding both work times and chores/assistance. Consider formalizing your monetary and activity based family assistance(paying rent etc), find a place that is 'separate' from where you sleep to work. Ideally this place should be outside of your home. 

Run away because that is a terrible questions. "I need you to deliver software from scratch, is that a problem?" should tell you a couple of things. It should tell you that for whatever reason the interviewer expects that there might be problems with you delivering an application. HOWEVER unless they know you how could they have doubts about you(let's ignore the silliness of trusting a 'yes' here.) The first thing this would make me think is that other devs have failed this 'requirement' in this company before and I would be wondering why. I would be guessing that they throw some mediocre 'specs' at a dev and expect them to poop out a fully functioning, polished app in a couple weeks. Probably with some awesome last minute modifications in the middle as well. Developers, regardless of how little we like to admit it, do not work in a vacuum. Even an amazing developer should be part of a larger team in order to succeed. A question like the one posed above primes me, as a developer, to worry that any delays(even legitimate ones like "Technology doesn't work like that" or "You went from wanting a music playing software to wanting a robot controlling software in the middle of development") will be pinned on the dev teams and not owned by management/other teams. A more legitimate question would be "We expect our developers to work from soup to nuts on applications. This means being highly involved with the planning, architecture, implementation and release of these softwares. Can you give me an example of a time you took a solution from drawing board to release?" Promises like the one you describe are a terrible interview technique and I would consider them a red flag for working at that company.
