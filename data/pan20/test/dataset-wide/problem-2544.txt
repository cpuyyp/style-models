There are many schools and teachers in Buddhism. They all contribute to the growing dispersement of Buddhist teaching. The past is full of references to the Buddhas of the past like Shakyamuni Buddha, his closest students, Bodhidharma, Dogen, and all the Buddhist teachers that have come to the west in the last 75 years. How can we know what tomorrow's flowers will look like and what scent they will carry when they are only seedlings popping out of rocky soil? Just don't know. 

In an interview the Dalai Lama says he watched shows like Discovery. He says he does not watch entertainment shows and does not listen to music. He apparently uses television like an educational book. $URL$ CTRL F type in television in the search box and you will see the interview excerpts. His Holiness the Dalai Lama does not put conditions on anyone of any religious orientation or intellectual direction. He accepts all as they are. He eats meat every other day due to a medical condition. He tries to be the leader of a country and a spiritual branch of Buddhism and stay relevant to the latest technologies. If your branch of Buddhism restricts media access, and that is acceptable to you, then follow the path you are on. We are all headed to the same destination, if there is a destination. Thank you for the question.apparently 

The essence of the Buddha's teaching is not to cling to physical existence and in the same line do not fear death. What dies is the life we conceptualize in our mind. What is untouched by death is the consciousness that the Buddha invites us to develop in our practice. 

If you mean liberal in the sense of non-traditional or neo-traditional the most accommodating of the modern way of life, I would look to outgrowths in the US because I am most familiar with that. Some sects practice freely to many degrees with women and men together such as Trungpa. For instance Roshi Suzuki wrote the following: $URL$ It is a very mild manner zen book. It has guidelines but not ones made of concrete, but ones that are flexible. There are a number of liberal teachers that may be of interest. Each person must examine their own beliefs and find a path that works for them. Someones tame philosophy could be another's abomination. This list is recommended reading. You may choose freely from this list and make up your own mind how you define liberal. $URL$ 

So they are trying to create a feeling of support in a monastery where you walk out the front door and are immediately confronted with the world. This quote from above 

I am not relying on traditional writings attributed to the Buddha, but upon knowledge of Buddhism and common sense as far as do no harm, but let me preface my comments that food by itself cannot prevent you from enlightenment. For instance the Tibetans lived in a high polar desert barely able to grow barley and raise animals to survive eating a diet heavy in meat. On the other hand, Buddhists in India often avoided meat because it so easily spoiled in their hot climate without refrigeration and could sicken the body. Neither place has an exclusive on enlightenment. If you fast forward to today, one thing one might do is consider foods that are friendly to the environment, that are not depleting forests like palm oil plantations, and do no harm to animals, eggs with range fed chickens. Tofu, soybean curd, can often replace meat and provide a high protein diet that seems to provide a keener awareness during meditation in people that are especially sensitive to a high carbohydrate diet and cycle between highs and lows in their mood and blood sugar levels. I think food is not a universally prescribed component of the path to awakening but varies according to geography, individual sensitivities to certain foods and local availability of food types. Shakyamuni was reported to have rice pudding with milk and sugar. It was what he had presented to him. Later he reportedly ate spoiled meat because it was presented to him. In that acceptance there is a strong message for us about how open we can be about food. 

As far as authorship, there are several references to translators, but unlike many Buddhist texts, the authorship is attributed to someone that may not have written it, of unknown authorship or a collaborative effort. $URL$ 

As soon as one starts discussing permanence, it is already in the field of impermanence. Intellectual understanding may suggest a path. The practice of the path can lead to the unknowable. No one who has been here has ever said anything that could describe it. 

It is too deep to understand Nibbana (or Nirvana as in the text below) from the human perspective, but it is possible to experience it. Dogen is a very verbose Zen master who has left many trails. Here TRICYCLE states some of Dogen's beliefs. If you want straight from Dogen, you can try some of his books from Shambala. $URL$ 

Dogen is saying Nibbana is always here but the human mind that does not practice the Buddha Way is not aware of it. The question of whether we exist or not could be restated to in what way do we exist or what is our real beingness. When we drop the mask and look in the mirror of consciousness we see more clearly what is and what is not. Talking about it before or after that point has minimal value. Experience in the practice of meditation is the great revealer. 

There is one more citation that speaks to the subtle differences of the different schools in relation to emptiness. $URL$ 

As most spiritual founders, the Buddha's life and actions are conveyed orally for 500 years and are prone to be expanded upon, embellished or even invented. I see the Flower Sermon as more representative of Buddha because for him the lesson was so simple. No need for words. No need for fiery emotions. Just hold up a flower - he is whispering inside, can't you see what is plain as day. One person saw it and became an important conveyor of the dharma. A later Buddhist is Dogen. He wrote the Shobo Genzo or True Dharma Eye in order to demystify Buddhism in Japan from a religion of beliefs to a practice of realization. Here is a link that describes this in more depth. $URL$ 

Perhaps there are some sects of Buddhism that preach salvation, but there is no god to save us in Buddhism, and there is no one that can be saved, and there is nothing that we need to be saved from. So salvation in Buddhism has no place to take root. The Buddha replied to an inquiry about who he was. He thought for a while and said "Awake." That same awakeness is here right now whether we are aware of it or not. If you want to read about Zen, you will find no salvation or hope of it. www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/zenmind.pdf But to answer your question, I would find any sect that denies any other religion difficult or impossible to defend as Buddhist. They violate one of the most sacred principles, Do No Harm. Denying any other religion is an attempt to harm another's path to awakening. If someone worships a rock, even that is their path to awakening. When the pursuit of awakening supersedes the pursuit of having the most powerful religion, we will have no reason for such debates. 

I think we have modern day examples like the khmer Rouge that wanted to wipe out anyone that did not think the way they did. I did not see a mobilizations of Buddhists to go fight the Khmer Rouge. If there is such an enemy, often Buddhists lay down their lives rather than fight. 

Rather than tell you how to meditate (follow the breath, concentrate, have compassion for all people, and other Buddhist meditation techniques) let me just say expand your meditation practice or add new elements to it. Of course this is not a recommendation to opt out of medical treatment if you feel that is your path, but it is to say that relief can be found, or at least a distancing and non-identification with the body sensations. Of course if you are bleeding, stop the bleeding, then meditate. Do all you can like accupressure, yoga or whatever gives you relief, then meditate. Start your day with meditation and end it with meditation. Distance yourself from the pain as you count the breaths. The pain may not disappear but the identification with the pain may disappear. This is the Buddhist concept of cessation. A pain is still a pain, but it is no longer my pain. It is a merely an electrical impulse in the aggregates that form the body. 

I think the most telling story told about the Buddha saying who he was and what his condition was when he responded to the question: "Who are you." The Buddha silently contemplated and then stated "I am awake!" It is unfortunate that we must rely on only oral transmissions (or the texts drawn from oral transmissions) of Shakyamuni Buddha so we cannot definitively quote his words in this story or in other texts with certainty. If this was a true story of the Buddha, it seems that it would be unlikely for him to claim enlightenment for himself. I don't see evidence that he saw himself as the sole Buddha apart from the people but as one of the people realizing his fullest potential. Some say his greatest sermon was holding up the flower. $URL$ Only one student of his knew the significance. This is an example how important silent transmission of the dharma was to Shakyamuni Buddha. 

Whether one is a lay practitioner or a monk, either way the key to progress is the daily practice. Either can meditate twice a day, do walking meditation, do karma work, do charity work, and raise their consciousness. Maybe the idea that the monastery is better than lay life is a concept that may be true or not true. Listing the jobs in each place and the challenges each offers may give a better idea of the demands of a monk or lay person. The Buddha did not give higher value to one over the other. Many lay person's attained enlightenment in Buddha's day. Perhaps the real question is one that must be asked within where there are no words or concepts and wait for an inner response: What is my calling in life? What have I come here to do? Why have I come here? What can I do that will most fulfill that aim? By allowing the beginner's mind, the nirvana consciousness to grow, these answers may appear when the time is ripe. 

Dogen is generally considered to be a Zen practitioner, but how can we exclude his observations from his own experience from any Buddhist practice? Here is another source that reinforces the ever present Nirvana in each of us $URL$ 

There is much material available that describes these practices such as $URL$ Here is a brief summary $URL$ 

Living without attachment is a lot like living without trying to get some outcome in the world. It is living life but not defining ourselves essentially as a companion or a worker or a studier or being just the body. So not being attached or not having expectations involves loosening up our own self identity that is wrapped up in the world and how it appears. If we are totally comfortable in this moment it is far easier to accept the relationship we have with that person. Keep practicing meditation every day and have meditation be part of your relationship could be a good start. Thank you 

If you use mindfulness to become aware, it is a likely occurrence that eventually things or events that have been buried will emerge. Some of these may be unpleasant but they must be faced or they remain as unfinished business. If mindfulness is practiced to the point where you can't do your job, relate to your friends and family, take care of your body, and lose the joy of living, then this is overdoing whatever you are practicing. 

I too am finding that small meals every 3-4 hours helps me meditate easier. Teachers like Ajahn Chah $URL$ have talked about not eating after 11am or noon. But he later developed diabetes and went into a coma for a year. Diabetes often is started by huge swings of blood sugar in hypoglycemia. That is why regular meals with protein (milk, tofu, yogurt, beans or meat if that is part of your diet) can help stabilize blood sugar and make diabetes a less probable outcome. In Thai monasteries with novices, they eat an early meal and then 11:30 eat the leftovers from the first. $URL$ There were reasons why monks ate only in the morning - to make sure eating does not interfere with meditation is the reason given $URL$ another practical reason is that the kitchen staff would not be able to participate at all in the afternoon or evening ceremonies if they had to cook many meals a day. There were definite reasons why that was chosen for centuries before, but what worked for another time and culture might be less effective today. 

Alan Watts appears to be a renaissance man that is not feeling constrained by any religion or philosophy. You can read general history and maybe get clues to who he was at $URL$ here is an excerpt "Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British-born philosopher, writer, and speaker, best known as an interpreter and populariser of Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies. Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961), Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy and not a religion. He also explored human consciousness, in the essay "The New Alchemy" (1958), and in the book The Joyous Cosmology (1962)." Watts proposed that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy and not a religion. So if this is what he thought, he may have not taken an eastern view of making peace with the eternal within as Buddhism proposes. He may have seen Buddhism as a means to a joyous life. To me, what I think about Buddhism is inconsequential compared to how I practice Buddhism. Not knowing him personally I would not know if his irreverence was a way past dualities that disguised a heartfelt practice. It reminds me of the story of the zen master who laughed at 4AM in the morning every morning and awoke the whole sangha. Students would ask him why he was laughing but he would just laugh more. Even approaching his death bed he would not vocalize a reason. After the master died his students searched through all his papers searching for the reason of his laughter, but no clues. I guess the zen master had the last laugh! 

What you may be implying is that greedy, self centered activity that values winning at any price with utter disregard for others needs is inconsistent with Buddhism and most other religious tenets. I cannot find the exact quote, but the Dalai Lama said that he is not against capitalism, but to earn lots of money and then use the money with socialist's principles to help others. Many people find their calling in business and are very successful. Some of them like Bill Gates set up foundations to help many people. If a Buddhist is on the path of business, why not succeed at business and then succeed at caring for others? 

The Buddha reportedly ate a meal of pork at least once in his life. So one pig had to lose its life. The Buddha ate rice pudding so some cow had to eat the grass to produce milk and some weeds must have lost their life to have grown the rice. It seems that no matter what we do in life some harm is done. Maybe do less harm would be more sensible. The Buddha advocated the middle way between hedonism and asceticism. The Tibetan Buddhists eat meat. So what are we to do? Do no harm against life for selfish ends. Do no harm against our neighbor to gain advantage. Dedicate your work to all beings. In your case you could donate some of the crop to food pantries servicing the homeless or needy. In another sense there is only consciousness. When we weed the garden in meditation we make room for a new consciousness. When we plant seeds in the garden or consciousness, we are planting the divine seed of awakening. Being paralyzed by fear of doing harm is not the middle way as I see it. Perhaps the saying should be Clear your intentions of doing harm. Have an intention of giving life. $URL$
