Has there been recent studies on this subject? Is there any compelling recent evidence for – or against – the hypothesis that the "unwritten doctrines" were the main part of the Platonic philosophy? 

Plato usually tried to solve philosophical problems using a schematic approach. Probably one of the best examples of this is the tripartite system, which he applies both to the human soul (psyché) and to the ideal city, assuming that there is an isomorphism relation between them. According to that theory, both entities can be divided into three components: reason, spirit and desire. But these three parts are presented as very distinct from each other, to the point that the whole theory sounds somewhat incoherent1. Aristotle also advances his theory of the soul, based on fundamental constituents arranged in a hyerarchical system. But, unlike the rather "mechanistic" view of Plato, Aristotle's theories try to show how these constituents work together, in a more organic way. And, this is true not only for the soul, but for his other theories, like his physics, ethics etc. History tells us that Plato was a mathematician while Aristotle was essentially a biologist. So, would it be safe to say that their different backgrounds had a very strong influence on their philosophies? In other words, did Aristotle tend to treat object of study as an organism because he was used to dealing with animals and plants, while Plato was more accustomed to abstract geometrical concepts? 

You might want to look into Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology. He explicitly states the problem in Sections 52-54, and calls it "the paradox of human subjectivity." However, you should be aware that his explication would make more sense if you have read the whole work. In general, his solution to this problem seems to me to be the underlying thesis of the whole work and one of the primary positive points of theory in his phenomenology. Merleau-Ponty takes up parallel themes in his Phenomenology of Perception. In general, the phenomenologists would be good references for this sort of thing. EDIT: I should also mention that Husserl's development of the issue is in more ontological terms than your naturalistic formulation. For him, there is a constitutive connection between consciousness and reason. Consciousness constitutes the world through meaning, and meaningful structures are limited by rationality. Husserl is also distinctly not a mind-body dualist. So the contours of the problem are going to be different, but I see the same basic difficulty here, i.e., the thrust of the question remains: how can it be that a part of the world (consciousness) constitutes the whole world? 

THe program of Universal Logic is mostly considered a joke by the professional logicians I have talked to. There seem to be two popular conceptions of logic among philosophers who think about logic. But before going into these, you have to understand first that, among present-day logicians, the philosophical concerns are most frequently secondary or tertiary if they are even taken into consideration at all. Today mathematical logic has taken on a life of its own and has merged for many with computer science in particular ways. It is, in general, a branch of mathematics. Thus, for a good majority of logicians, engaging in the study of the properties of a non-classical logic is frequently done for its own sake, not much different from studying the properties of any mathematical structure. It's also frequently done in view of computer science. The point here being that much logic done today is not motivated primarily by philosophical concerns, and rarely will you see logicians even engaging in the kinds of arguments you are talking about. But among philosophical logicians and philosophers who think about logic, there seem to be two streams of thought. First, there seems to be the view that logic can form the structural core of a metaphysics. This view is that of Williamson and his followers in his Modal Logic as Metaphysics. It is in this sense that there could be a correct logic for propositions that you are looking for. But today I think you'll have trouble finding anyone who thinks classical logic forms the core of a metaphysics, since modal metaphysics is in. So it's usually modal logics dealing with necessity that are taken to be a structural core of a metaphysics, since they can deal with dependence and grounding structures in a way that non-intensional classical logics cannot. The other guiding conception of logic that has emerged with the dominance of mathematical logic is logic as a tool, either in the sense of an organon or in the sense of an intellectual tool-kit. On this conception of logic is the device by which philosophers start from premises and draw conclusions. In the sense of organon, then, logic prepares the way for science by providing the device by which one may generate new conclusions from premises. With the proliferation of non-classical logics, many take a quite pluralistic approach. Any logical system has paradigm cases and problem cases. With a pluralistic conception, one simply uses whichever logical system’s paradigm cases conform most closely to the matters at hand, be it a classical or non-classical mathematical logic, a dialectical or Hegelian logic, or something else. Personally the last time I have seen arguments regarding the "correct" logic in the sense you are discussing is back in the Quine-Montague days. Quine's arguments were quite frequently motivated by a concern with preserving the classical meanings of the first-order logical terms, which indicates his endorsement of classical logic as the "correct" one. But these arguments are not really going on today, and certainly not among logicians. 

There is a consistent pattern throughout the corpus of Plato's dialogues: first, Socrates proposes a philosophical problem, like "what is justice?" or "is there an immortal soul?". Then he goes on to challenge each attempt of his interlocutors at defining the concept or solving the problem. As the dialogue evolves, the reader is presented with the opportunity of gaining deeper and deeper insights into the problem. But at some point, the dialogue ends, leaving the question unsettled. And then, the style of the text changes and he starts narrating a myth, like the one depicting the fate of human souls after death, at the end of Phaedo. How should we understand these closing myths? Are they the "correct" solution (from Plato's point of view) that could not be attained by the dialectic method? Or are these myths just a different approach to the problem that, although very useful, do not solve the problem, either?

In the Theaetetus, one of the theories of knowledge examined by Socrates and Theaetetus is that all knowledge comes from perception. At the same time, they are examining another theory: that everything that exists is never still, immutable, but is constantly changing (becoming). But they do not seem to make any distinction between the two theories. As I could understand, they lump them together, treating the two as the same hypothesis, only expressed in different ways. Or, perhaps, as parts of a single unified theory, which Socrates attributes to Protagoras. To me, however, they look like very different theories, each one dealing with a different problem. I'm wondering what is the connection between them. A possible solution that occurred to me is: since everything can be perceived differently by different people – or even by the same the person at different times – nothing is absolute. Everything depends on the person perceiving it. But not in the relativistic sense that there is no truth. Let's take one of the examples given by Socrates. When a healthy man drinks wine, the wine tastes sweet to him, but when he is ill, it tastes bitter. It's not only the case that he perceives the taste of the wine differently, but the wine itself becomes different at the moment of perception. Is this the correct interpretation? 

I'm assuming you mean a graduate degree. If you mean an undergraduate degree, you can disregard all subsequent paragraphs. But I will say it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to genuinely answer any deep and pressing philosophical questions for yourself solely from obtaining a BA in philosophy. You would need many more years than that, along with more in-depth research. Even a Master's degree would only allow you to dip your toes in the shallow end. As far as PhD goes, I think it very well could help you answer your life-long questions, but it would also make them look more complicated to you. In fact, you should reflect on what kind of answer you are looking for. I know many very thoughtful people who ask genuine questions, but are quite satisfied by simple, unsystematic answers; their eyes will glaze over when confronted with the kinds of details a PhD in philosophy works with. This will give you a more precise understanding, but at the same time can be immensely tedious and disconnect you from the basic "folk" philosophical concerns of the layman. You have to decide what you are really after. Here are some other factors I would urge you to take into serious consideration. First, you should understand that graduate programs in philosophy are geared toward training you to be a professional in the field, at least at schools in the top 50 or so of the Philosophical Gourmet, for example. That doesn't mean you can't go there and take some courses and write a good dissertation and learn a whole lot about philosophy. But a lot of the actions of your mentors might be geared toward getting you into a research field that is seen as viable for getting jobs, and in getting material to write you good recommendation letters. If you are up front with your advisors about your intent, it is possible that they will see you as being less worth their time, since they will gain nothing in professional terms for the time they put in with you. Make no mistake about it, many of the top professional "philosophers" are out there to build a career first and foremost; genuine philosophical concern is often secondary. So, if you do go, you may want to consider how straightforward you are with your advisors about what you are doing. Second, graduate programs in philosophy are highly non-standardized. Different faculties will have different specializations, and different faculty members will have their own specializations. Even an epistemologist will usually have some specific subfield of epistemology, for example, that may be wildly orthogonal to your actual interests. Don't go accepting a position at a school just because you got in. Only go if there are at least two faculty members there that are quite in line with what you want to do, quite specifically. I say this because there is no substitute for actual face-to-face interaction with the top people in the field when you want to get to the cutting edge of a philosophical question. If you're at a graduate program where there aren't any top people with connections to other top people in the questions you are specifically interested in, you may well find that they can't really help you get to the bottom of your questions, not any better than you could have done on your own trawling through the literature. Third, and maybe most obviously, do not accept a position that is not fully funded. This will usually include some kind of teaching duties, so keep that in mind. If you hate teaching or aren't willing to do it to fund your degree, you might have a hard time. Also, despite being fully-funded, your income will be very difficult to get by on. Depending on costs of living and your specific funding package, you may have to adjust your lifestyle in ways that are uncomfortable and undesirable. If you have a significant other, you can expect your bank account to be at 0 at the end of every month, and if you have a family to support then you'd better have some kind of independent means IMO. Fourth, consider the amount of time of your life it will take, and how that time will be spent in a mundane sense. It is not uncommon to take 7 years to complete a PhD in philosophy. If investigating this question is how you want to spend the next 7 years, then by all means it may be completely worthwhile. But you should also consider what you'll do on the other side. In the midst of a PhD program it is very easy to forget about all other aspects of life. Have some back up plans and an exit route. You may find that 7 years of mostly solitary working in your room with books harmful to your psyche in certain ways, and you should expect quite frequently to lose sight of your original intentions. You will be around people who are desperate for professional opportunity, you will have to listen to them constantly talk about their anxieties about the job market, and you will have to deal with the politics that comes along with that sort of thing. It will take a strong sense of self and a strong support network to keep yourself reminded of your inmost intentions and get to the end of the program. 

Piraeus was the place where the Thirty Tyrants were defeated and democracy restored, in 403 BCE. Being the port of Athens, Piraeus was – as any other port city in the world – full of foreigners, some of whom, like Cephalus, were very rich. This would be related to the discussion about whether cultural diversity in a city is a good thing or not. 

One way to approach this is by Aristotle's metaphysics. According to Aristotle, everything there is can be classified in one of the following ten categories: (1) substance; (2) quantity; (3) quality; (4) relatives; (5) somewhere; (6) sometime; (7) being in a position; (8) having; (9) acting; and (10) being acted upon (1b25-2a4). According to his definitions, a substance is something that cannot "be said of" nor "be in" another thing. And substances come in degrees: primary substances are individuals, like this particular man or that particular horse. Next on the scale, we find species (e.g. "man", in the sense of human, encompassing the whole class of human beings) and genera (e.g. "animal"). Substance has a primacy over the other nine categories, since all of them exist "in a" substance. A quantity, for example, refers to how many items of a certain substance we are talking about. Similarly for all the other categories, known collectively as accidents.And, among substances, the primacy is reserved to the primary substances. Everything has to ultimately rely upon the existence of individuals. We can only talk about man – as a species – if there are particular men in the world, so we can apply the name "man" to them and say things like "Socrates is a man". In particular, the category "quality" is important to your question. Although Aristotle does not give us a precise definition of what quality is, we can grasp the concept with little difficulty. When we say that a certain horse is beautiful, it is clear that we are ascribing a quality to the horse. Consequently, we can also beautify a horse, that is, we can increase that quality in the horse. So, what about "beauty"? Is it also a substance? For linguistic reasons, we are sometimes led to think so. After all, "beauty" is a noun and therefore can be modified by an adjective, like "beautiful". Likewise, it can be the object of a verb, like "beautify". Semantically, of course, the phrases "beautiful beauty" or "beautify the beauty" are problematic (the very heart of your question, after all). But syntactically, they are ok. As in the famous example "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously", which is a perfectly grammatical sentence, but full of self-contradictions. But the fact that "beauty" is a noun doesn't change the fact that it still is quality. Moreover, there are no individual beauties, that exist by themselves, detached from substances and to which we can predicate things. A bit more formally: "beautify X" means "increase the quality beauty in X", where X is a substance. As we have seen, beauty can only be a quality, not a substance. So we cannot substitute beauty for X, in this case. In other words, "beautify the beauty" makes no sense at all. 

The sentence is not a huge problem to treat logically, but it does require a stipulated way of treating indexicals to ensure that it will behave logically the way it seems it should (to be true whenever uttered, yet contingently so). So, contrary to what others have said, it is a sentence that holds some interest in logic as a paradigm of an indexical sentence whose propositional content varies across circumstances and yet remains true whenever uttered. For example, Kaplan's influential treatment of indexicals and demonstratives is known as a "two-dimensional" account of indexicals. On such an account, you can guarantee that the sentence "I am here now" will come out true, while still preserving within your logical representation of the proposition expressed the sense of contingency and the structure of that contingency. More generally, I would offer, looking at the logical properties of such a sentence can teach us about how indexicals work in the language, and, depending upon your view of the relation between semantics and ontology, may even hold metaphysical lessons (of course this would require argumentation). You might look at the following SEP articles to dig deeper into the study of indexicals and two-dimensional treatment of them if that interests you: $URL$ $URL$ 

Whether a certain "being" in the domain should be represented as an entity or as a value. Roughly speaking, an entity is an object that exists by itself, has an identity and a thread of continuity over time. A value contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. This distinction mirrors that between essence and accident, respectively, in Aristotelian jargon. How to represent the passage of time for an entity (see item 1): either as a series of changes of state through which an ephemeral entity undergoes; or as a series of immutable states arranged in a sequence. In the latter case, each of these states keeps existing forever, associated with a point in time in the life of that entity. 

According to Professor David Roochnik, in his lectures about The Republic, the choice of Piraeus as the setting for the dialogue is symbolic for two main reasons: 

As a software developer, I often face the problem of meaningless terms. It is very common in our industry that a certain term is first coined with a very specific and useful meaning. Then, it becomes fashionable to use that term, so everyone starts using it to mean more and more things until, in a couple of years, the term has become so diluted that its original meaning is lost altogether. This has been occurring with the term agile, for example. Which philosophers have addressed this probem of dilution of meaning and how to avoid it? I have illustrated the problem with a software development example, but it may occur in every professional field. When a term has reached that meaningless state, it becomes impossible to have a rational, useful and unambiguous discussion.
