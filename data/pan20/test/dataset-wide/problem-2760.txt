How do you differentiate co-premises from chains of reasoning in an argument map? For example, consider the following argument from our studying materials: "Just after the Second World War, Germans adopted cigarettes as a form of currency. This is an excellent form of money; it is almost impossible to forge. It is also very convenient, as it comes in clear denominations of a cigarette, a packet, and a carton. Money that comes in such denominations is easy to count. (...)" My confusion is related to the statement "cigarettes are convenient", which supports the conclusion that cigarettes are an excellent form of money. How is the support structure for "cigarettes are convenient"? Would you put "it comes in clear denominations (...)" and "money coming in denominations is easy to count" as co-premises supporting "cigarettes are convenient"? Or would you put "money coming in denominations is easy to count" as a premise of cigarettes are convenient and as a conclusion of "cigarettes come in clear denominations"? Thank you for your replies in advance! 

Sometimes I cannot distinguish arguments from Nonarguments. For example, according to the book "A concise introduction to logic" by Hurley the following is an example of an argument: "There appears to be a growing happiness gap between men and women. Women today are working more and relaxing less, while men are working less and relaxing more. Forty years ago a typical woman spent 40 minutes more per week than the typical man performing an activity considered unpleasant. Today, with men working less, the gap is 90 minutes and growing." On the other hand, the following passage is considered to be a Nonargument: "Authoritarian states are characterized by strong central governments that fairly stringently limit the range of political activity. More often than not, they are one-party states, which means that only one party, that which supports the government, is allowed to engage in political activity. Free discussion and association are strictly curtailed in these systems. Anyone who might dare to criticize the government or to express ideas that are not in conformity with its policies can be severely punished, even by death." In one section Hurley gives examples of Nonarguments. An "explanation", according to him, is such a case. He points out that an important feature of explanations is that the phenomenon in question is usually accepted as a matter of fact. This piece of evidence gave me reason to believe the first example is an argument, because a growing happiness gap between men and women is not something which is obvious from the start. The second example, though, is not considered an argument and just an explanation, because "strong central governments that fairly stringently limit the range of political activity" is an intrinsic attribute of Authoritarian states and thus an accepted matter of fact. I got example number 2 wrong and thought it was an argument, when in fact it is not. In an attempt to justify this, I came up with the reasoning written in italic. Is my reasoning good? 

I read that Cartesian Dualism is a subtype of Interactionism but I'm still confused. Can somebody help me to clear up this matter? 

The way you stated your question, I'm not entirely clear what you are asking. You seem to be asking, "By what means/under what circumstances can someone simultaneously justify taking someone's life and upholding life value (right to life)?" It is technically not a conflicting position to hold as long as you don't believe that this life value (or "right to life") is an intrinsic value or right. You just have to assert that it is contingent on each person's behavior. That is, one's right to life can be forfeited under certain circumstances (i.e. after a heinous crime is committed). Under this view, people are born and by default they are given the right to life as long as they abide by society's prevailing moral standards. 

This doesn't seem like a philosophy question because you are looking for empirical research, but in attempting to answer it from discussions in philosophy I run into another problem because of your choice of the word "sacrifice". You ask, "In which circumstances have they found that people are actually more willing to sacrifice?", presumably referring to sacrificing the one innocent bystander for five strangers. As I recall from my own research in this topic, most people would not kill (sacrifice?) the innocent man to save 5 strangers, just as you wouldn't kill a random person waiting in the emergency room of a hospital to save X patients who need organs to survive. However, if I conceive of a situation in which the innocent man is not innocent at all, but say, Hitler, I think most people wouldn't mind letting him stop the train of 5 strangers. But at that point, is it a sacrifice? It doesn't seem like a sacrifice because you are not losing anything. 

It is only a conflict if you hold that life is intrinsically valuable. Then you would never be able to justify taking a life, except perhaps in self-defense. 

If you are a causal determinist and you believe that the mind is wholly the product of physical processes, theoretically it should someday be possible to completely access other people's minds and—hooking them up to ours—experience the world exactly as they do. For people who died prior to the invention of this technology, we can only theorize as to what actually was going through their minds. After the invention of this technology, however, finding out what a person was thinking would be as simple as loading up a computer chip. Honestly though, it is not likely we will need to go that far. It is likely we will integrate our minds with computers (thus making memory easily accessible) long before we develop the technology that bridges the gap between seeing billions of neurons fire and actually having phenomenological experience ("qualia", so to speak). That's just my prediction, anyway. 

This depends entirely on your moral framework; as a moral objectivist, the particular moment "when" it is OK to "break the rules" is arbitrary, based on each person's own moral viewpoint. I.E. there is no universal "it is always OK to break the rules if X happens". We determine when it is OK for each of ourselves and this "breaking point" will inevitably vary from person to person. 

It is not known whether widely used axiomatic systems such as ZFC are consistent and Godel has shown that it is not possible to prove that they are, at least within the system. In an inconsistent system it is possible to prove anything, so essentially it is useless. If ZFC is inconsistent, then it is very well hidden. Are there any known examples of inconsistent systems that behave consistently "at first," in the sense that the shortest path to proving both a statement and its negation is very complicated? 

There's a difference here between a "grammar error" and something being "ungrammatical." A grammar error is a violation of prescriptive rules of a language, and is more a subtle measure of education than a barrier to understanding. An "ungrammatical" sentence cannot possibly be uttered by someone speaking the language competently. For an example, "Me and my mother went to the store" is a valid English sentence understood by anyone who competently speaks the language, but prescriptively the use of "me" is incorrect because if you remove "and my mother" it becomes *Me went to the store, which is ungrammatical. This prescriptive rule that you should be able to remove part of the subject and retain grammaticality does not seem to genuinely be part of the language, but it is for the most part adhered to by educated speakers because it is taught in schools. 

I believe that the concept of equality is universal and does not depend on any prior assumptions. Two things that have identical properties, even if they occupy the same location, can be different, but it may be impossible to know this. Often equality is conflated with equivalence, which is a property that is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric. But we have options in defining an equivalence relation. It is artificial and arbitrary. Equality is an equivalence relation, but so is the relation where all objects are equivalent. Equivalence relations behave in many ways like equality, and they are tailored to be useful in a certain situation. For example, in modular arithmetic we say that two numbers are equivalent (or congruent) modulo n if they differ by a multiple of n. There is special notation to indicate that 5 is congruent to 8 modulo 3, and it is not correct to say that 5=8. Equivalence relations can always be defined in terms of equality. Since 5 is congruent to 8 modulo 3, we may write [5]=[8], where [k] denotes the equivalence class of k modulo 3. Two objects are equivalent if and only if their equivalence classes are equal. For convenience in more advanced mathematical exposition this distinction is dropped notationally and we may indeed write 5=8, as long as the intended meaning is understood. I can't define equality in a way that isn't circular, but I do not think it is something that we can pick and choose. Any observer will detect things that are equal as being the same, and some things that are not equal may be perceived as equal by an observer even though they are not.
