As an economist in training, it is my understanding that the idea that there is a fixed amount of work is considered a fallacy by most economists. For example, when Paul Krugman discusses it, he merely states "Economists call it the 'lump of labor fallacy.'" When I looked on Wikipedia, it confirmed my belief but with a caveat: 

Secondly, many times on its website, Shadow Government Statistics says its inflation estimates are "based on methodologies in place as of 1980 and as of 1990." If that's the case, previous studies into the measurement error of the CPI during that time period will be enough to validate or debunk the SGS's numbers. Well, according to The Consumer Price Index as a Measure of Inflation which analyzes the bias of the CPI between 1967 and 1992, the bias is in the order of 0.5% at the highest. That's within the margin of error of the previous results. (Note: If we look into the bias prior to 1982, however, the bias is greater.) In Conclusion: The claim that the Bureau of Labor Statistics underestimate inflation by seven or eight percentage points is extraordinary, as it would imply that most investors are losing money by lending at a negative real interest rate. As their methodology is not published on their website, as their critique of the current way CPI is calculated is mostly congruent with mainstream economics and as economic analysis only measure a bias of 1%, it is unlikely that Shadow Government Statistics is correct in its belief that inflation is still around 10%. 

Since 2008, whenever the possibly of an election is brought up, the Conservative Party of Canada repeats the same point: elections are bad for the economy. For example, here's an excerpt of Jim Flaherty's speech in 2010: 

It is a common myth that, if you're stung by a jellyfish, then pouring urine on the wound is an effective way to treat the injury or ease the pain. That belief is deeply entrenched in the American popular culture. So deeply, in fact, that in Survivor: Marquesas, one of the contestants asked one of his teammates to pee on his wound to relieve the pain after being stung (though, this time, it was sea urchin rather than a jellyfish). Is there any truth to that belief? 

The answer to this question is "we're not sure yet." The "old minimum wage research" shows that there is a negative impact, but more recent research - e.g. Card and Kreuger (1993) and Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) - show that there is no significant effect. There have been attempts at reconciliation the literature on the subject, but, to the best of my knowledge, nothing resembling a consensus has been achieved amongst economists. When reviewing the possibility to raise the minimum wage again, Québec's Interdepartmental Committee for the Review of the Minimum Wage compiled a short review of the literature. It's written in language most people will understand, and only six pages long. It's definitively worth reading. In the event you don't feel like reading it, the most interesting passage is the following: 

In other words, the notion that the CPI imperfect or biased is in line with mainstream economics. The critique by SGS overlaps with the admission of bias by the Bank of Canada but this is where the agreement stops. When we go into discussing the size of the bias or its possible solutions, mainstream economics and Shadow Government Statistics disagrees. First, when economists try to measure the bias of the CPI, they arrive at under 1%, which is obviously quite far from the seven or eight percentage point bias that SGS's figures entail. For example, in Measurement Error in the Consumer Price Index: Where Do We Stand?, the authors conclude that: 

Additionally, they also measured what they called "blue effect," which the "average of worry and sadness," and "positive effect," which is defined "by the average of three dichotomous items (reports of happiness, enjoyment, and frequent smiling and laughter)." After evaluating the results of the 2008 and 2009 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, the authors found that emotional well-being correlates with income, up to an an annual income of $75,000, after which point it has. They also found that both positive effect and blue effect correlates with income (positive effect positively and blue effects negatively), also only up to a certain point. On the other hand,m life evaluation correlated strongly with education and income. In light of those results, they conclude that (emphasis mine): 

First, let's imagine that Shadow Government Statistics is correct and that the inflation was around 10% in 2006. It would mean that the real interest rate on Treasure Bills would have been of approximately -6%, which is insane. No one would have bought them, if that was the case. Wikipedia defines real interest rates as follows: 

As has been pointed out in the comment above, the specific claim that we see ourselves as exactly five times more attractive is a little absurd. There are no units measuring beauty, that I am aware of. In social sciences, when the attractiveness of an individual has to be rated, it is rated on a scale where, for example, one would mean low attractiveness and five high attractiveness. Under such scales, everyone in the study would literally have to be of a 5/5 attractiveness and yet rate themselves as a 1/5 attractiveness. That's highly unlikely, to say the least. Thus, I'm inclined to dismiss the notion that we see ourselves five times more attractive than we are as bogus. Leaving at that, however, is leaving much unanswered. There is, I think, a vaguer but still quite interesting claim to investigate: Do we overestimate our own attractiveness? That question has an answer, and the answer is yes. According to the authors of The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us, relating the findings of Narcissistic Illusions in Self-Evaluations of Intelligence and Attractiveness, 

It is often claimed that goldfishes have a very short memory, usually of two or three seconds. Like most claims in the real world, I have yet to see a source provided for it. So, do goldfishes have a short memory? 

First, there is evidence that lowering corporate income tax (CIT) will lead to an increase average of salary. For example, in Passing the burden: Corporate tax incidence in open economies, R. Alison Felix finds that: 

In other words, it's a bad idea to let politicians like Robert Mugabe have control over a large part of your country's GDP, but many countries such as Sweden and Norway are wealthy countries, in spite of having a large public sector, because of competent economic policies. There's a large body of literature on what consists the best "tax mix." The data seems to point toward a high consumption taxes, low corporate income taxes, and moderate personal income taxes. For example, the OECD paper Do tax structures affect aggregate economic growth? Empirical evidence from a panel of OECD countries concludes: 

The argument - that elections harm the economic growth or recovery - seems a bit absurd. I'm not alone to think so; it's been mocked by economists and columnists alike. Unfortunately, I have not seen any evidence supporting either side's argument. So, is there any empirical data supporting the claim that elections are bad for the economy? 

The argument that higher value-added taxes is a great solution to income inequality, because it can fund cash transfers to the less fortunate, is hardly new to me. However, it is the first time I read that VATs may naturally be progressive, even without any cash transfer to the poor. Is there any literature backing his claim? 

However, upon doing a review of the economic growth literature in 2002 (15 Years of New Growth Economics: What Have We Learnt?), Xavier Sala-i-Martin concluded that: 

As such, I wouldn't worry too much of the presence of E-numbers in the food you eat. If there were any solid evidence of risk, it wouldn't be allowed for consumption. When there is uncertainty, some countries will decide to ban the additive; others won't. That does not mean that the product is harmful; it only means that it's possibly harmful. Adjust your dietary habits in consequence of how you feel about products whose affects on health are possibly harmful. 

In the countries where they've been banned, it's usually in spite of the lack of evidence. For example, in 2008, when the Food Standard Agency is announced it was considering banning those six specific E-numbers, here's how The Guardian reported the news: 

Even though the corporate income tax rates have been reduced by half, the revenues (as percentage of GDP) have remained relatively steady, rising or falling with the economy. If CIT revenues were proportional to CIT rate, there would be a drastic fall in revenues over the decades. That didn't happen. The other taxes (consumption, property, and personal income) seem to much less disruptive. As such, cutting them won't result in voodoo economics the same way cutting corporate income taxes would. Then, Xavier Sala-i-Martin concludes in this survey that: 

The idea that the CPI is biased is hardly new or controversial. In fact, such is taught in economic textbooks (Introduction à la macroéconomie moderne, p. 148-149) and the Bank of Canada even has a section of its website dedicated to explaining its shortcomings: 

In High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being, the authors make the distinction between two factors aspects to happiness and then evaluate each aspect's relation with income. The first one is emotional well-being, which they define as: 

Taxes do affect economic growth, but not equally. From the OECD paper, Do tax structures affect aggregate economic growth? Empirical evidence from a panel of OECD countries: 

In other words, a government that focuses on the right tax mix (high consumption and property tax, low corporate income tax, and reasonable personal income tax), such as Sweden, will have a tax system that has little negative effect on the economy in spite of having a large public sector. In summary: 

The article you cited, which links six coloring agents with hyperactivity, the study's result was apparently overstated by The Lancet's press release. According to Dr Paul Illing, Registered Toxicologist and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, 

If, as Shadow Stats claims, the inflation in the United States was up to 10% and the interest rate on Treasure Bills was of about 4% (source), then the real interest rate would be negative (4%-10% = -6%). Under a negative real interest rate, people lending money to the government would be losing money whereas the US government would be earning money by borrowing. It would make no sense to lend money at such a low rate, yet demand for Treasure Bills remained relatively stable during 2006. Such a situation would be unsustainable. Eventually, lenders would wise up and stop lending until the real interest rates go back up. It makes no sense for people to invest at a negative rate of return. If inflation was that high, then interest rate would increase as well for to at least positive returns on investment. That is the most obvious reason Shadow Government Statistics is wrong: if they were right, Treasure Bills would be ways to give money to the US government rather than an investment. Now, what did Shadow Stats did do to arrive to such values and how is it superior to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' methodology? I can't say. While they have promised to that their methodology will be "published in next month’s 'Reporting Focus'" back in October 2005, I can't find that month's "Reporting Focus" - or any detailed methodology - anywhere on their site. Based on their criticism of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we can make a few educated guesses though. Back in August 2008, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published an article called Common Misconceptions about the Consumer Price Index: Questions and Answers to which Shadow Government Statistics felt need to reply to in ShadowStats.com Response to BLS Article on CPI Misconceptions. In the response SGS goes into details into why he believes the BLS is biased and underestimates inflation. He blames three factors, which are well summarized in this Forbes article:
