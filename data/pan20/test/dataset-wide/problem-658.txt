Typically these are nice and cheap, they also last a very long time. In the wet they work remarkably well on steel rims, although it can take a wheel revolution for the braking power to kick in. To work around this 'turbo lag for braking' you can put the brakes on extra early to clean the rims of water and get into a habit of having your brakes ready on tricky descents, junctions etc. You can run them just on the rear wheel first, in that way you can see how they work and use your existing rear pads on the front when the existing set run out. Don't let their hum-drum appearance put you off - if you have steel rims they are a performance product.

If you are replacing just the chain (and not the sprockets or chainset) here is a tip for getting the chain length correct. Take the old chain off and hold it up with the new chain. Compare the length and remove 2-4 links so that the the two chains are of the 'same' length. Same ? Chains wear, that wear means the chain appears to have stretched. Sometimes this 'stretch' can be minimal, at other times it can be as much as a link, or maybe more. Should the 'stretch' amount to a link's length then you are advised to replace the sprockets too. This is because they are also likely to be worn out. If you are in the business of fixing bikes regularly then it is useful to have two small nails in the workshop, high up and above the metal recycling bin. In that way you can hook the old and new chains onto the nails and compare lengths that bit easier. When done you can then release the old chain straight into the bin, thereby minimizing dirt/grease/oil on one's hands. This technique works, it also saves time and reduces the likelihood of getting the chain length wrong. 

Probably best to not go through the specific components on my bike, however, the sprockets, chainset, jockey wheels and chain need replacing due to excessive wear. Coupled with that, the cables are in need of replacement too. The rear rim is wearing a bit thin so a new wheel might also be prudent. I have done some back of the envelope calculations and the parts bill alone comes to 2/3 the price I paid for the bike originally. Hence, do I just get a new bike? If I do, can I just throw the old one away without any qualms about wasting what is a nice bike, albeit worn out? 

Latex tubes? The posh 'extra comfy', low-rolling resistance 'latex' tubes that cost twice that of normal tubes can deflate quicker than is desirable. Valves can also be a problem, typically from getting chalk dust particles inside the valve innards. This can be the case with both valve types, however, with Presta you can mitigate against this by ensuring the valves are done up tight. Remember that rubber perishes when in contact with the elements, to minimise the chance of this make sure the valve caps are present. As noted, if one tyre deflates quicker than the other then it is likely that you have a slow puncture. This puncture may not necessarily be visible to the naked eye, holes can be a 'normal' part of the manufacturing process or they can be introduced around the valve seat. Different tyres deflate over time at different rates. This is proportional to the tyre volume, e.g. a 20" x 1.5" tyre will deflate quicker than a 26" x 2.3" tyre. 5-10 PSI is borderline acceptable, even if accounting for air lost connecting up your track pump. You should only need to attend to tyre pressure every fortnight. 

If you are on a budget and need a quality repair stand for your garage or workshop, do consider the two-hooks in the ceiling and two bits of rope method. The idea is that you have two hooks in the ceiling spaced approximately a metre apart. These hooks are the ones that you can get in bike shops for storing bikes with and typically cost less than Â£10. The rope has to be fairly thick, 20mm or thereabouts. With both pieces of rope you need to put a loop around each end and tied with a simple knot. Length depends on your ceiling height, with one loop going from the hook, around the saddle and back up to the ceiling. The other loops around the stem in the same way. When the bike is suspended from the hooks and rope it needs to be level and with the brakes just below your eye-line. When working on the bike (whilst it is hanging from the ceiling) there are situations when you will have to steady the bike, there are also a few tasks (such as removing a crank) when the improvised 'stand' may not be up to the forces you apply to it, requiring you to drop the bike to the ground to get 'a bit more purchase). The two-hooks method gives you better access to the whole bike as there is no stand in the way. This is particularly useful when setting up the gears. Another benefit is that you do not have a stand molesting your paintwork as can happen with those stands that have cheap jaws. Perhaps the greatest benefit though is speed. To hook the seat through the loop of rope and feed the second rope around the stem takes seconds, with a proper posh stand this can take a lot longer, which is not that fun if the bike is heavy or the front wheel flops around a bit. 

You can have mudguards and a chainguard, mudguards and drop bars, but not drop bars and a chainguard: $URL$ To use an automotive analogy, you are looking for the station-wagon version of a two-seater sports car. That said, why not put drops on an old Raleigh 3-speed? The 3-speed Sturmey Archer lever will be simple enough to mount, you will just need new bars, levers, all-important bar-end plugs and tape. Obviously the bars will need to be the older 25.4mm clamp size, but you should be able to acquire these bits and bobs second hand for not much money. The alternative option of getting a chainguard to put on a retro Raleigh is a bit harder - those were a bit model specific whereas handlebars are not. Personally I have a 12 speed Raleigh Gran Sport with the drop bars and a Raleigh Sports 3 Speed with the 'Northroad' bars. I would not swap the bars over on either because they are well thought out and go with the frame geometry. The 'Northroads' bars are a real treat and, if I did not already have a 3-speed with them, I would look for a bike with them. 

There are two standard ways that a rear rack fits onto the bike: 3 point fixing and 4 point fixing. Most but not all racks on the marketplace come with a small bag of parts for the fit. The most important question is if your bike actually has eyelets. These small holes on the rear dropouts are crucial if you want to fit full mudguards or a rack. If you do not have these then it is not the end of the world, you will just have to have a more expensive solution. One of the rack manufacturers does a kit: 

The Rockshox at Paris Roubaix were a Greg LeMond thing. Whatever Greg competed in a few 'out there' cycling innovations came along with him. Remember those tri-bars that gave him the aero tuck position to beat Laurent Fignon in the Tour de France? On that event he also had his own road bars that had an extra position, where the drop handlebar end plugs would be, his bars turned in 90 degrees to give an extra lower position. Anyway, it was his Team-Z that introduced the Rockshox on Roubaix. Seems that your well chosen pic duly notes his special handlebars, the Rockshox and 'Team Z'. Greg's bars and forks were not widely adopted although his time-trial bars most certainly were. In any evolutionary process some mutations just don't work. As for the forks, the problems with them were that they were heavy, the brake touched the rim and they introduced 'sloppiness' in the front end. Imaginably these problems would be overcome but they were not. I don't think UCI regulations had anything to do with it, the product at that time was just not that good. MTB forks were a bit dubious too back then, only when the disk brake came along did the 'brake rub' problem get properly solved. There are plenty of 700c forks on hybrid bikes from mainstream manufacturers, generally of the low-end 'Suntour' variety with a spring that does the work instead of any sophisticated oil/air arrangement. You might want to go to a bike shop and do your own compare and contrast of the bikes with 700c suspension forks. The travel is around 50mm or so and there generally is no adjustment on them. I think Trek do a few models with them, Giant did too on the more expensive 'Expression' models. Although experiences are subjective, I found that along gravel trails the hybrid with no suspension felt better than the efforts with suspension. I wondered if the suspension was doing anything at all, it did not float over the bumps like a full-suspension mountain bike does and there was no real cut in handlebar vibration. Here is a Suntour offering with coil spring, preload adjuster and lockout. This model is typically found on things like deluxe Trek hybrid bikes: 

I would recommend that you take a look at getting an Electra Townie bike. They use what they call 'flat foot technology', which is where you can put your feet down on the ground easily and without having to hop off the saddle or balance the bike on a tip-toe. They achieve this by putting the bars higher, the pedals further forward and the seat back. This works well in flat terrain but is not so good out of the saddle going up e.g. Cotswold hills. But you aren't going to be doing that with a childseat on the back, so have a look into it. Regardless of whether you are male or female, a step through frame is a very good idea when carrying a child seat. Step-thru frames are definitely not just for girls, the benefit is getting on or off and not having to swing a leg over the front or the back of the bike. Carrying stuff with a bike that has a child on the back is not that simple, you don't want a rucksack and panniers are not going to happen. A basket is what you want, ideally one that is bolted to the frame and not the handlebars. In that way the steering is not affected. Weight doesn't make any difference to a bike if you are loading it up with a heavy child on the back. Riding is a momentum thing. Take a look at the Kona Africabike - this has three speeds, possibly a back-pedal brake, 'Northroad' style handlebars, chunky bullet-proof tyres, step-through frame, basket correctly mounted on the front, a rack on the back and a built in lock that should be enough for a two-minute stop to get a pint of milk. The Africabike scheme is definitely something you will want to be part of - for every two bikes sold in the West one is donated to some doctor/midwife person in Africa. The older ones are made of steel and very heavy, plus they have a rack that is too wide for a child seat. The newer 2011 ones in white are alloy with a narrow rack that does take a child seat. The rack is a lot more solid than regular racks as it is part of the frame. This will impact your choice of child-seat, you may want to go for a Hamax one as they have built in suspension. There is also a sturdy kick-stand on the Africabike, useful for when loading up the bike and not having that many hands free.
