So here is my questions, what can tactics can I use to make this prison ? To narrow it down, Here is some precise question : 

Keep our little mages in the prison Keep our little mages secure (Need a way to deal with fights between inmates) Allow our little mages to have a degree of freedom similar to the one of a regular prison. Make money using our little mages (Enough to be self sufficient would be awesome) Keep in a reasonable amount of little mages (150 ?) 

In my world, Magic and Wizards are rare. (About 1 % of the population produce magic energy) Sometimes, you stumble upon bad wizards who keeps using their awesome skills to bother people, by setting them on fire or making them fly at high speed. Those guys need to be punished but how are we going to keep them in ? Even better, how are we going to put them to good use ? My goal is to create some kind of prison that allow us to : 

It's a flightless bird As others have pointed out, a creature would not dive if it was unable to do so due to being too buoyant, and if it had no reason to. As for reasons for diving, one is to get food and another is to avoid attack from aerial predators. The latter reason is taken care of by the armour, but we have to ask why a surface-dwelling organism would evolve armour instead of evolving the ability to dive, which is probably the easier solution for most organisms. This is where buoyancy comes in. If the animal is very lightweight it will be hard for it to evolve diving behaviour, and it might take the armour strategy instead. Buoyancy means low density, i.e. light weight for the size. But why would an animal be so light weight? One obvious reason is flight. So: we have to imagine that this organism's ancestors were birds, or pterodactyls or similar flying creatures. Think of something like a large sea bird, though not necessarily a whale-sized one. It eats something that lives near the surface, so it doesn't need to dive very deep (if at all), and it spends a lot of its time resting on the water surface, using its feet to paddle like a duck or a swan. If food is very plentiful and predators are few, then birds will often lose the ability to fly. We just have to imagine that this happens here, resulting in a bird-like animal that spends all of its time paddling in the water, never taking to the air. (One difficulty is that a bird would need to lay its eggs on dry ground, but if this is not an Earth species we can imagine that it has live young instead. Or it could evolve a special body cavity in which to incubate its eggs or something - you'll have to be inventive here.) After that, we just need it to evolve its large size and armoured back. Sea animals seem to evolve a large size quite often. The reasons for this are not completely understood (though see here), but the same thing might well happen to a flightless sea bird. It would be easier for it to stay warm, it would have bigger fat reserves, and it would be so big that no predator could eat it. However, since it's sitting helpless in the water it could still be attacked by other aerial predators, who peck at its flesh without killing it. An armoured skin would be a sensible evolutionary response to this. 

In general, AI's nowadays are programmed to use machine learning - programmed to program themselves. At first, the AI in question would be given sample data, for example showing it that if it starts trolling on the Internet, human suffering is increased. Then, it is allowed to test what to do on it's own, learning what things cause human suffering. Now that it knows what causes it, it can reliably increase human suffering. If the AI's learning algorithm is written well (which I assume it is), then the only defect could be the sample/learning data, which means that the learning needs to be restarted. If say, it found that people at hospitals suffered a lot, it would send everyone to hospitals, in the end increasing human happiness because everyone is treated. Therefore, the test data must be chosen carefully. 

Ramifications He would most likely spend a lot of money on this, and would also have to pay for PR to get people to know about his private fire department. The actual fire department would be made obsolete, and would become a total waste of money for taxpayers. People would become dependent on his services, as his dept. is more reliable than the official one, and if he ran out of money he would leave the city fully without fire protection. Toes Stepped On 

This is implicit in the other answers, but it deserves to be made explicit: if you want a deeper ocean, a smaller planet will be better than a big one. The main thing limiting the depth of a liquid ocean is that when the pressure gets to around 1GPa, the pressure will cause the water to become ice, even at warm temperatures. This is a special forms of ice (actually one of several different special forms of ice) that is denser than water, so it sinks and forms the ocean floor. Probably most of the oceans on the icy moons in the Solar system, such as Europa, have exotic ices at the bottom. The pressure at a given depth is given by the density of water multiplied by the height of the water column, multiplied by the strength of the planet's gravity. Thus the higher gravity of a Jupiter-like planet would mean that exotic ices would start to form at a shallower depth of water than on an Earth-like planet, whereas on a planet smaller than Earth you could have deeper water before you reach the critical pressure. The relationship is linear, so a planet with half the gravity can have oceans twice as deep. 

If the planet is small, and perhaps needs to have a large moon that occasionally blocks the ring due to small discrepancies in the orbiting of the planet, the planet would need a very dense core so that it does not have to be enormous to have such a large moon. Osmium would be an interesting element to have as the core. Also, if the civilization of the planet is based on small islands scattered throughout a gigantic ocean, and each has never had contact with the others, then for them it will happen more rarely, while as a whole it occurs on the planet commonly. This would limit storytelling, but perhaps conquest of other islands and realization of the commonality of the solar eclipse could be fun to use ("our great eclipse is very often! The world is plunging into darkness! It's the apocalypse!"). TLDR: Dense core for large moon, small islands in large ocean. 

The asker says in a comment that "there is so many layers of bureaucracy and indoctrination that the aliens themselves don't even know why they are invading Earth or any other planet, other than if they don't they will be executed for insubordination." This seems to me all that's needed for an answer. The commander continues the invasion because to do otherwise would entail filing the appropriate paperwork - and that would be a far more difficult and dangerous task than simply continuing to send more troops indefinitely. I actually quite like that as a basis for a story. It does what it needs to do, and has a darkly comic message about the futility of war. 

Humans who prefer to be completely alone are rare, but they exist. Perhaps with dragons it's the other way around: perhaps, very rarely, a dragon comes along who is outgoing and charismatic towards other dragons. With a sufficiently Machiavellian mindset, perhaps such an exceptional dragon could convince the other dragons to put aside their instinctive indifference to one another and unite as a single force. In order to do this it might be useful for this new dragon to have a scapegoat, an enemy for the dragons to unite against. Even if the human threat is not in reality all that credible or severe, the charismatic dragon might be able to drum up fear and resentment against them in order to achieve its aims. ("My fellow dragons, yet another of our number has been senselessly slain. How many more dragon lives must be lost before we put an end to the encroaching human menace once and for all," etc. etc.) Then the humans would suddenly find themselves under siege by a powerful force against which they are not really prepared to defend themselves - which might make for good drama if that's the sort of thing you're going for. 

Part of the justification for the Hindu caste system was that the higher castes (priests, warriors) were good in previous lives. Perhaps you could implement something of the sort. This does begin to fall apart when you go back and back, because there were less people then than now, and so there must be people who appear without a prelife. This could be used as a reason for not taking censuses in the area in question (if this is for fiction of any kind). 

Could there ever be a river or stream in which gold can be gathered if a net is placed propensity to the flow? I mean in the long term, getting substantial amounts of gold every day. 

Mayor - the mayor is not amused, as he is being made irrelevant by this rich guy Fire Department Head - he is also being made useless, and if he quits and joins the new department, he will be subordinate to his former subordinates. Taxpayers - the new fire department will make the old one just a waste of money The Slacking Firefighters - those who formerly worked for the government and did nothing would be upset, as if they quit and join the new department they will have to actually work, be subordinate to former subordinates, and can be fired due to the faster operation of the private method. Firefighter Unions - because this is not the government, lobbying is harder. The owner can easily fire all of the current ones and hire new firefighters if the unions become too bossy Cybersecurity Advocates - Hacking into a government system is both a demonstration of the lack of security and breaking of the law Police - it is going to be harder to coordinate with firefighters because the two department heads no longer are both subordinate to the same guy Environment Advocates - Because there are so many new fire departments and firefighters, more water and materials must be used to supply and equip them People whose houses burned down - "Why isn't the money being used to rebuild my house?" I am still alive and need a home Tax Collectors - how do you collect taxes from a private corporation that works as a public service? Bureaucrats - they can't skim money off of the top of a private corporation General public - it is hard to dial a private phone number in an emergency, as it will most likely have not three but ten digits, possibly more 

From a science point of view, yes, if life were discovered on Venus, there would be an immediate switch in priorities. Scientifically this would be huge. (And contrary to other answers, science rather than colonisation is the main reason for funding space missions in the current political climate.) It would be our first discovery of life anywhere away from Earth, so there would be a huge wave of media excitement and popular interest, and as a result, funding for space missions, especially Venus ones, would go up for a while. Scientists all over the world would be intensely excited to answer all sorts of questions about Venus life: did it arise independently of Earth life, or was life transported from one planet to another via meteorite impacts, which is thought to be possible? Does Venus life use the same amino acids and nucleic acids as Earth life, or is its chemistry completely different? How does life survive in the incredibly harsh environment on Venus, and how many places on the planet can it live? There is basically nobody in biology or planetary sciences who wouldn't immediately want to know all that. Then there's all the potential medical applications of a whole other biosphere full of biologically active molecules that are probably not found on Earth. So basically it's a no-brainer: there's no doubt that if this was discovered there would be at least one follow-up mission, perhaps several, designed specifically to study it. This would indeed quite likely involve cuts in funding for Mars missions, because that's just the way things work. These Venus missions would not be manned, due to Venus' thick corrosive atmosphere. This not only makes it extremely hard for even an unmanned spacecraft to last very long but also means that you can't blast off from Venus unless you manage to take something the size of a Saturn V with you and land it on the surface - that's currently quite some way beyond what humans are practically capable of. So these would be robotic missions with specifically designed experiments for studying Venusian biology. Perhaps people would consider a sample return mission - i.e. an unmanned spacecraft that picks up a sample and takes it back to Earth - though I would guess that would be unfeasible at our present stage of development. However, there is a big caveat to be mentioned. Life is thought to be very unlikely on Venus, due to the extremely high temperature and sulfuric acid rain - certainly no known Earth life can survive there. We can suspend disbelief and imagine that life finds a way to survive there anyway, but it also poses another problem: no probe sent to Venus in 2022 will include equipment to detect life, because nobody expects to find it there. Detecting life in non-Earth-like soil is hard - even the recent Mars probes don't carry equipment designed to do that, because it would be prohibitively expensive to do so. So the probe will not carry PCR equipment for detecting DNA; it will not carry an experiment to culture any bacteria it might happen to find, and it will not carry the microscope and special dyes that would be needed to attempt to observe cells directly. Even if the soil on Venus were teeming with as many bacteria on Earth, it would look as lifeless as Earth dirt to the rover's sensors. If you're really lucky a growing bacterial colony might be observed by the cameras, but it would just look like a small stain that changes slowly in size, and it would be impossible to be sure that that was actually life rather than just a chemical phenomenon. For these reasons, it's extremely unlikely that a near-future Venus rover would find life on Venus even if it were there - they only way I can think of it happening is if there is not just bacteria but actual complex multicellular life that can be directly and unmistakably observed by a camera.
