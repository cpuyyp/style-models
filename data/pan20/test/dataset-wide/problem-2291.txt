There are assorted biodegradable soaps which purport to be more environmentally friendly, although biodegradable soaps are not necessarily 100% environmentally friendly, especially if they end up in a water supply. The biodegradation typically only works in soils. If you're following LNT principles though, you should be washing over soils whenever possible as that will help prevent runoff into water sources and any tiny food particles are more likely to be broken down quickly in biologically active soil than in relatively lifeless dirt or rocks. 

I did a bit of research and it appears that NFPA 1983 is a standard for ropes used in technical rescue, similar to UIAA ratings for climbing ropes. The tag you found seems to imply that this rope meets the specifications of the 2001 edition of NFPA standard 1983 for a life safety rope. I couldn't find a free copy of the 2001 standard, but in the 2012 edition the following performance requirements are specified: 

The response speed of the GEOS IERCC is going to depend on how well-connected they are with emergency responders in your area, but it looks like it takes about 11 minutes for SPOT's service to determine your location and contact the authorities. Once "The Authorities" have been notified Once they have been alerted, the time for rescue crews to actually show up is going to be dependent on many factors, including: 

It's not clear to me whether your rope is a "technical use" rope or a "general use" rope, but the standard calls for a minimum strength of 20 kN for the former and 40 kN for the latter. Note that in all cases these are static ropes. This gives some information about what your rope might be, but again, you can't know 100% for sure what it is until you figure out who bought it, and they figure out what they bought. If you're sure it's been well-cared-for it might be safe to use, but I would be very hesitant to use it, especially with groups of less-experienced climbers who may be depending on your judgement and assume that any equipment you provide would be safe to use. 

For padding you can typically use extra clothes. Use the patient's clothes if they're available, because you probably won't get yours back! Fluffy items like fleece or down jackets are good – they're comfortable, can conform to unusual shapes, and will also prevent the limb from getting cold (since it won't fit in a jacket very well once it's all splinted up!). For wrapping materials I usually carry a couple of ACE bandages in my first aid kit, but in a pinch you could tear up any stretchy fabric like a T-shirt. The wrapping material should be stretchy and wide, to distribute pressure evenly. Don't use cord, as it will apply pressure in a very narrow line, causing discomfort and possible reduction of circulation. 

Types of satellite-based emergency beacons Personal Locator Beacons Personal Locator Beacons (or PLBs) have one and only one purpose: to send your location to emergency responders, indicating that you need some kind of urgent help. They use a satellite network operated by government agencies worldwide, and send your distress call directly to a government-run rescue coordination center. When you initiate a distress call, the following sequence of events happens (from REI's article on PLBs and locator beacons): 

IMO the best solution right now is not to go. I live in the PNW, and I'm simply avoiding strenuous exercise until air quality improves. I wouldn't enjoy hiking with a mask on, and it's unhealthy to exert oneself with these air quality levels. I had a hike planned for this weekend which I called off due to the fire and air quality situation, and that same day 140 people got trapped on a trail overnight when a fire blocked the trail. Recreational hiking can wait until safer conditions return. Edit: Some areas in the PNW have official trail closures right now. I'm not going to link to them directly because this information changes constantly. Before going to a USFS area, search for and you should be able to find a page with current closure information – for example, this page for the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area shows fire-related closures on the PCT and many other trails. If you are going to other areas, you can check with the proper ranger district office for the region you are planning to visit. 

Not all manufacturers follow the FL1 standard, although most reputable ones do. Some have their own testing process which is similar, while others simply make up numbers to sound good so they can sell lots of crappy products to poorly informed consumers. Certainly be skeptical of outrageous claims, especially if the product doesn't have FL1 Standard markings on the packaging or website. Also, note that device characteristics can significantly affect actual output compared to specifications. In particular: 

Be prepared for somebody to forget something important. I usually bring an extra warmth layer, an extra warm hat, and some extra food (typically some compact energy bars). It's good to personally, visually confirm that people brought all the required gear. "Everybody show me your rain coat" not only ensures that everybody's coat is adequate, it also ensures that nobody accidentally left theirs behind. As for group management, the most important thing is to check in with everybody often, and don't be afraid to turn back if people aren't up for your original plan. It's better to turn back before the summit than to end up in a bad situation with people who are exhausted and inexperienced. Sometimes people will be feeling tired, but they feel bad about holding back the group so they won't say anything. Keep an eye out for that. Before leaving, make sure to ask each person if they have any medical conditions you should be aware of, if they typically carry any type of medication, and if so make sure they have it and that you know where it is. It's better to know people's basic medical info before it becomes necessary. It's also important to keep an eye on your own well-being. It's easy to get distracted when taking care of 5 other people, but since you're the person responsible for the group, it's paramount that you're well fed, hydrated, etc. Don't forget to take care of yourself! 

I went kayaking for the first time this weekend, and it was a blast! Unfortunately, I also ended up with some abraded skin on my hands, where the paddle shaft had chaffed the skin. I've done other paddle sports before, and while my hands would often develop callouses over time in specific areas, I never experienced discomfort/blisters like this. What are some good ways to avoid this? Just get over it and wait for callouses to form if I kayak more often? Are there gloves that help reduce the friction? Maybe some kind of wrap on the shaft, similar to bar type on bike handlebars? 

All that being said, suppose you really don't have any other option but to carry your buddy out. After attending to any immediate threats to life (airway, breathing, circulation, serious deformities, exposure to environment), every person in the group needs to sit down, eat some food, drink some water, and generally make sure they are as well-taken care of as possible before carrying on. You're going to be carrying 100-300 pounds probably for several days, plus all your own gear. Making sure every group member has their own needs taken care of ensures that they'll be in good enough condition to then take care of the injured group member. Don't let your rescuers become rescuees themselves. Now that everybody in your group is in good condition, you can start building a stretcher. Other websites have pretty detailed instructions for different methods depending on what equipment you have available. Here's a good one: Improvised stretcher: UK Real First Aid The general idea is, you don't necessarily want to make a setup with two rigid poles and something in between. Instead, you want to bundle your patient up like a burrito, provide some rigidity, and have a package you can pick up or even drag if necessary. If you're in an even mildly cold environment, it helps to put the patient in a sleeping bag first. They aren't working, so they'll get cold quick. Regardless of environment, a camping pad is a good first layer. You can then put trekking poles, ski poles, or even use the patient's backpack frame (since they won't be carrying it now) to provide some structure. Lash the whole thing together with straps (again, consider using the patient's backpack as a starting point), utility cord, etc. A sleeping pad and 50' of nylon utility cord should be standard on any trip, especially in such a remote place that any of this would be necessary. Once you've made your patient burrito, use as many people as possible to lift it. If there's any concern for a spinal injury and you have enough people available, have one person solely dedicated to immobilizing the patient's head. Transporting by an improvised stretcher will cause them to be jostled a lot, and you need to have somebody hold onto the sides of their head to prevent damage. If not enough people are available, you can use jackets on either side of their head to immobilize, or a SAM splint if one is available. When you're ready to lift, the person holding the head is in charge. If they're not present, then choose a person to be in charge. That person should verify individually with each lifting person that they are ready, then ask the entire group if anybody is not ready. Do a count down before lifting, then lift slowly and together. Once you're carrying, it's imperative to walk slowly and carefully to avoid dropping the patient or injuring any of the carriers. Stop frequently to rest. A slow evacuation is more likely to be successful than a rushed evacuation. When setting the patient down, follow the same procedure as picking them up: head holder is leader, check with the group, count down. It may be safer in some places to drag the patient than to carry them. If going through very narrow or unstable terrain, you don't want to drop the patient. While being dragged is uncomfortable, being dropped is much worse. Finally, remember to stop often and keep the entire group warm, hydrated, and fed. Hungry, tired, dehydrated, or cold rescuers will quickly become patients themselves, exponentially worsening your situation. Also, don't forget to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs throughout your journey. It's easy to get so focused on the evacuation that you forget to pay attention to the patient you're evacuating. Keep a log of their heart rate, respiratory rate, skin color and temperature, level of consciousness, and any reported pain throughout your journey. This is very helpful to monitor trends and see if their condition is stable, improving, or declining. 

Bear spray can only be used outside the tent, but if you did decide to use a gun, the walls of a tent aren't going to do much to stop a bullet. Anyhow, the walls of a tarp are going to get in your way too. The real issue here is that a tarp A-frame tent is vastly inferior to almost any kind of real tent. You're far more likely to get hypothermia from having inadequate shelter than you are to have a bear even come through your camp, let alone get into a situation where your choice of shelter affects the interaction with the bear. 

You should not hang a bear can; as whatsisname mentions it could be counterproductive and make it easier for a bear to make off with it. Not just that, but it will be a significant hassle for you to hang it. You should always prop some rocks around your can so it can't be rolled away as easily. Don't put it near a cliff, because you don't want it getting rolled off the edge. (Note that in many places bear canisters are required by law. A few such places I've been (by no means an exhaustive list of where they're required!) include anywhere (National Forest or National Park) in the Sierra Nevada (CA), Yellowstone National Park, Denali National Park, many places in the Washington Cascades, and managed areas (i.e. parks and reserves) in Yukon and Northern Territories in Canada.) 

Regardless of your cleaning procedures, you definitely should use purified drinking-quality water for at least the final rinse of your dishes. I always play it safe and use purified water for all dish washing, unless I specifically intend to boil water again in the same pot later for purification. You should also do all cooking and cleaning at least 200 feet away from any stream, trail, or campsite. 

Lux does depend on position, because it's light per area. The further you get from the light source the more the light beam has diffused, so the less light hits a particular area, as illustrated by this drawing from Wikipedia: 

As for overall statistics, I don't think there's any unified reporting system for mountaineering accidents. Each search and rescue agency and mountaineering group tends to keep their own numbers but there isn't an organization in place to collect and publish those data in aggregate. You ask about canyon accidents and have the canyoneering tag, so I'm not sure if you're referring to mountaineering/climbing/hiking accidents that occur in canyons and ravines or if you're referring to canyoneering as in exploring rivers in canyons. If the latter, you might find more relevant scenarios and statistics by looking for data about swift water rescue. I'm not aware of any specific resources for this but they may be more readily available than canyoneering-specific data in mountaineering publications. 

The Milepost Guidebook has a list of points of interest along the Stewart-Cassiar Highway, which includes campgrounds. 

Poison oak season has begun around here, with fields full of the nasty stuff growing everywhere. I tend to dress conservatively in areas I know have poison oak, to avoid getting exposed in the first place. Were I to be exposed, how should I clean the poison oak from my skin? I'm aware of various hi-tech products designed to clean poison oak, but am unsure whether they're actually any more effective than just using regular soap and water. 

With either a PLB or a commercial device, the response time is going to mostly be a factor of your location, not the signal getting out. The signal will be located quickly, but rescue crews may take minutes to hours to arrive depending on the situation. Making yourself easy to find If you have a GPS-based device, rescue crews should be able to locate you to within ±100m, so you don't generally need a long-distance signal like a smoke column. Making a fire (if conditions are appropriate and safe to do so) can help especially at night. A signaling mirror is very helpful in daylight for catching a pilot's attention. Place yourself in a wide open area if possible. At night you can use a flashlight to get the attention of helicopters once you hear them nearby. Once you've been noticed, don't shine the flashlight directly at the cockpit as pilots will be using night-vision goggles and could be blinded. Large areas of unnatural colors, such as a bright tarp or tent, can also help you to stand out. 

Paracord is widely considered a must-have for wilderness survival, and there are hundreds of tutorials for making bracelets out of it, etc. With this popularity has come a glut of people selling "paracord" that doesn't actually have the strength and durability of "real" paracord, and may not even be made from nylon. Considering the inconsistent quality of cord sold as "paracord", is paracord actually the most practical cord to carry while backpacking or engaging in other wilderness activities, or is there a better alternative? I'm thinking of uses like replacing broken shoelaces, rigging a tarp up as a shelter, creating extra guylines for tents, etc. I'm not really looking for a specific click-here-buy-now product link; I'm more interested in what types of cords are available, how to identify them, what their merits are, and how to select a good one based on what I'll be doing with the cord.
