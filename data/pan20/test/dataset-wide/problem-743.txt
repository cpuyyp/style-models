Your valve has slipped partially inside the hole in the rim where it exits. Normally it's on average about 1-1/2" outside the hole. You'll need to inspect the valve body to see if it's cut. You can't put a pump on it because the main body of the valve is stuck. First fix the valve body position, then inspect... Here's how to fix: 

Deflate the tire about 90%. Grip the tire where it meets the rim and pinch it together with your fingers. Do this for the circumference of the wheel. You want the bead of the tire the part closest to the rim to release completely. Now grab the tire in one hand and the spokes in a another, hands about a foot apart. Gently pull your hands together in opposite directions. The goal here is to get the flat tire to slide on the rim, straightening the valve. You don't need much about 1/2" to and 1". Use your fingers to jiggle the valve back and forth to get it to pull fully out from the rim hole. Optionally use pliers but take care not to crush the valve cap threads. If it helps put a valve cap on to pull up and out. Here's your answer --> With the valve position fixed you can now visually inspect the valve. If you see cuts on the side of the valve body you might have a valve flat that air will leak from. Fill the tire back up taking care to keep the tire bead on and no inner tube bulging out from the rim. If you saw cuts in step 6, jiggle the valve and make sure you don't hear air escaping. If you do the valve is damaged, replace inner tube. Optional: A bit of slightly soapy water works here too. Cover the valve body with soapy water. If you see bubbles leaking, that's bad, replace tube. 

Do the nipples come with a standard body diameter for a particular gauge or is it possible to find slimmer or fatter bodies? 

What replacement wheels/rims that can be fitted into bike are available these days? Below I focus my requirements on the rims as they are probably easier to come by than complete wheels but if there are new wheels available then I'd love to know the vendor/manufacturer. Ideally I would like not to modify anything and stick with size with taking tyres if such option exists at all. The next acceptable option would be same size with which would require replacing the hubs (which I hope can be obtained more easily). Yet another possibility is any other wheel size that would fit the bike without modifications (with the exception of the hubs). The least acceptable option would be a solution requiring mudguards removal, front fork replacement, brakes change etc. However, out of curiosity I would be happy to see what more drastic routes can be followed. 

It can be frustrating to be in this position. I've finally learned the trick of instead of tightening the lock nut into the cones, back tighten the cone against the locking bolt. That is, get it so it has no play, but a little resistance and back the cone up into the locking bolt As M. Werner says, a lot of online instructions say a little bit of play is made up for by the quick release and this may be just the thing for you. You have to wonder, though, after all the careful adjusting, why would we rely on this inexact method? 

I had the exact same issue. I was on a swim team and biking to work every day, but staying the same weight. It changed when I started replacing carbs and sugars in my diet with fiber, protein and fat. This meant eggs instead of cereal or toast at breakfast, a big salad instead of a sandwich at lunch, and avoiding pasta, pizza and tortillas at dinner. It also meant wine instead of beer and 75% dark chocolate instead of ice cream. Use the Glycemic Index (measure of how much sugar pours into your bloodstream after eating) of the food in question to know if you should eat it. A bagel might seem healthy, but it has a higher glycemic index than Coke. Avoid oatmeal. Eat eggs and sausage instead. It seems counter-intuitive, I know. Without the rise and fall of blood sugar making me hungry, my appetite got under control and I felt less sleepy. I dropped weight so fast, I started feeling too cold in winter and couldn't make automatic doors work any more (OK, just kidding in that last one). The problem is that like most diets, it is tough to stay on this one and when you do slip, it kicks off that blood sugar roller coaster. 

Sorry to hear someone vandalized your bicycle. I've been a bike mechanic in the past and there is a point of no return for rims in my opinion. This issue is that point can be subjective based on bike use and needed quality. From this point on, the wheel will tend to come out of true easier due to the weakened rim. Interesting, what you did by stepping on the rim I've seen done at shops and recommended in how-to videos. You can get a spoke nipple wrench and improve the rim by truing between the brake pads. Grep "how to true bike wheel" on Google for a start. I've seen side-to-side improve a bit in extreme cases but up/down hops will be harder to get out. If you do take the self-serve option remember use little corrections at first. Also, attempt to keep all spoke tensions even. Taking it to a shop is an option but labor plus and parts will be a chunk of cash towards a new wheel at the end you'll still have a wheel on a rebuilt rim. Finally I don't know how the bike shops are in your area, I would give you a free assessment if you came to mine. After all this, if the wheel refuses to stay in true sorry but it would be replacement time. 

My advice: Get a floor pump with a pressure gauge and an easy way to switch between shraeder and presta. and get one that is servicable. I have the topeak Joe Blow. Take a look at the dual nozzle. Also get a portable pump. There are several kinds that unfold and remove the pain of portable pumps (I could never get a good pressure in those because they require you to hold it steady while pumping. (One time I tore my freaking valve off my inner tube) I got a topeak road morph. You can unfold a little foot brace, unfold the handle and it has a flexible tube to attach to your valve, so it is almost as easy to use as a floor pump. I've saved myself some long walks and pumped up other's flats. And it has taken abuse, is super light. I think I got it for $35.00 US. It also has a gauge and, according to this thread, is user-servicable. 

I find the gears are too low for my needs. I don't use the smallest chainwheel and I don't use the biggest sprocket either. I thought I could quickly solve the problem low-cost by upgrading to CS-HG41 11-28T cassette but once I got round to removing the block it turned out that the "cassette" on the bike was in fact a freewheel. Bugger! Apparently Shimano used to make FW726 11-28T freewheel but they are nowhere to be found. How to solve this pickle? I'm thinking my options are: 

Don't use poison. It will likely not work. Would you be able to remove a dead spider from your bike anyway? How would you know it was dead? Poison is bad for other insects and animals in general. It's bad for you. I believe it's against the spirit of biking too. I don't think a bike cover will work for you. You will give spiders another place to hide. Even if it's very well sealed I can't see any reason why spiders wouldn't want to wander around your cover just as they wander around your bike. Unless it wraps around your bike tightly it will likely have creases that again will create perfect places for spiders to hide. What you can do:
