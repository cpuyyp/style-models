Non-Closure The main risk that I see with an n-dimensional creature being freed from their n-dimensional brane to an n+1-dimensional brane is that in n+1 dimensions, structures that would be closed in n-dimensions would no longer be closed. As an example, imagine a 2d creature with a closed circulatory system, which would in its most simplified form be two concentric circles with circulatory fluid between them. If we describe the 2D space as having dimensional axes X and Y, and the 3D space as adding a Z-axis, then in the Z axis, the creature's internals would be unbounded, resulting in the inside and outside of the circulatory system from separating, along with the circulatory fluid. In other words, the creature would literally fall apart. Going from 3D to 4D, the risks are similar. 3D creatures' organs are all connected in the macroscopic realm and none are free-floating as may be necessary in a 2D organism, however most organisms have cells with free-floating organelles. Given 3D axes X, Y & Z, when the W-axis is added, neither the cell contents nor the creature's circulatory fluids would be in a bounded volume, and would spill out in a fatal manner. Structural Stability Assuming that we applied a minimally substantial membrane to the open sides of the n-dimensional creature that we intend to move to n+1 dimensions so that it would not simply fall apart, if this membrane was flexible, it could result in the creature crumpling up along the added axis, as it would have no structural strength in this direction, having obtained the necessary strength from the n-brane binding energy. This crumping might not have any effect on the creature's biology, but it would reduce the possibility of acting in the additional axis. Senses Should the structural stability matter be addressed, there is the question of what an n-dimensional being could sense in n+1 dimensions. Most senses should work as expected given their dimensional limitations, and we could expect eyes to work the same too. However, while brane-bound, eyes work because photons travel on the surface of the brane, but freed from the brane, photons may intersect the retina without ever having passed through the lens if the means by which the open sides of the body in the n+1st dimension are closed is transparent. Additionally, we could expect that the optical sensing cells would be sensitive to photons coming from the n-dimensional axes more than photons coming from the additional axis. This would be proportional to the angle of incidence. So, in effect, an n-dimensional creature would see an n-1-dimensional slice through the n+1 dimensional space, plus an unfocussed light aura (since the photons coming from the additional axis would probably not have passed through any lens) caused by light from the additional axis, becoming brighter as its angle of incidence approached that of the eyes' axis, when the image would snap into focus. Contrary to the novella "Flatland", an n-dimensional individual transported to a n+1-dimensional location and rotated would not see their whole n-brane as an n-dimensional image, but as an n-1 dimensional cross-section through the n-brane. 

In the movie Pacific Rim, we see the beginnings of an alien invasion using very large mobile lifeforms. Given that we want as large a lifeform as possible with the following traits: 

The myth of the Minotaur states that the monster must eat humans for sustenance. It also states that Athens was obliged to provide seven young noblemen and seven noble maidens each one, seven or nine years (sources differ) as a sacrifice to feed to the minotaur. Assuming that the minotaur requires 3000kcal per day as per the OP's question, and that a 70kg human provides 750 mj, or 179254 kcal. Thus, we have: 179254 * 14 / 3000 = 836.52 Thus, one batch of Athenian sacrifices might feed the OP's Minotaur for 2.29 years. Given these energetics, the minotaur could either be bigger and require more energy (up to 6870.79 kcal/day) and have yearly sacrifices to feed him, or he would need his diet supplemented by additional human sacrifices sourced from elsewhere. Given the pragmatics of the situation, I'd go with the more (locally) popular option of feeding the minotaur yearly foreign sacrifices. So, if we play with the input parameters of this online calculator, based on the presumption of a 21 year old male, the Minotaur could be 300cm tall (if standing fully upright), weighing 250kg, and considering that he would be only lightly active - given the need to run down and kill a sacrifice for a few hours each 26 days - these yearly sacrifices would be entirely sufficient to last him all year. As an additional factor, the online calculator I used states that at the height and weight I proposed, the Minotaur would be overweight, with a BMI of 27.7. Since the Minotaur would be fed once each 26 days, and may well eat a sacrifice in less than this amount of time, having fat reserves would be useful. His weight would obviously fluctuate 

If you have Alcubierre drives, then the drive itself can be weaponised. It is expected that the forward field will accumulate photons and release them ahead of the ship when the drive field collapses, in the form of very high energy photons. By triggering a burst of Alcubierre warp in the direction of the enemy and pumping photons into the forward drive field, on dropping warp, the photons, now carrying a lot of energy, will continue on toward the enemy.

Humans require an oxygen atmosphere to breathe, and require multicellular life to eat. They also require temperatures roughly similar to those found today. It has been shown through geologic methods that the oxygenation of the atmosphere occurred during the Precambrian era, reaching levels possibly high enough to support human life around 1.9 billion years ago, though due to the low levels of oxygen, it would be like living at very high altitudes all the time. However, there is no evidence of large multicellular life, so humans deposited in this era would be reduced to filtering the sea and scraping stromatolites to obtain anything even remotely nourishing. Survival would be possible, but existence would be pretty boring and the potential for societal growth would be highly limited due to the lack of combustibles and the lethargy that the low oxygen levels would impose. A more likely period for humans to be able to thrive in would be the Ediacaran era, 635-542 million years ago, when oxygen levels were closer to our own and there was an abundance of simple multicellular life. Earlier than this (The Cryogenian era, 850-635 million years ago), the earth was an iceball, with ice-caps reaching to or near to the equator, and the temperatures would likely have proved inhospitable. Life for humans during the Ediacaran era would likely still be quite boring, as the life forms that existed then - other than potentially being pathogenic - were so simple that they would be easy prey for humans. Obtaining food would be simple, though possibly quite tedious. Since most life is thought to have existed in the sea, humans would be forced to live on coastlines. This era was also quite cold as earth was still warming after the Cryogenian era. The earliest potentially interesting period would be the following era, the Cambrian, from 541 to 485 million years ago, during which all the modern phyla of life originated. However, most life was still in the seas during this time, and humans would likely still be forced to be a coastal species with a fairly boring existence. The earliest period in which humans could live as a land-based rather than a coastal species would be the Devonian (419-358 MYA) or the Carboniferous (358-298 MYA) eras, during which land-based life spread out and became established. The appearance of large plants means that this is the earliest period in which humans could potentially establish proper civilisations. 

In space, no-one (else) can really hear your weapon fire, unless their ship's sensors can detect the weapon firing (by its electromagnetic signature) and provide an artificial audible feedback. This could be anything from "Pew" or "Zap" or "crack" to "Energy weapons fire detected bearing...". In an atmosphere, the audible signature of the weapon depends on the power of the weapon. Where the power of an energy weapon is high enough to ionise the air it passes through, the cessation of the beam results in the low-pressure ionised path it carved in the atmosphere collapsing with a crack or a bang, the loudness increasing and the pitch decreasing with the diameter of the ionised path. Dye-lasers in an atmosphere typically make a distinctive crack or bang with each pulse. The weapon itself may be entirely silent, or it may make a quiet, high-pitched whine similar to the charging capacitors in a camera flash. Indeed, many solid rod lasers are pumped using flash tubes, so this high-energy capacitor whine would be entirely in-character. It is possible that a weapon might whine quietly, the pitch increasing as charge accumulates, holding at a high pitch when full charge is reached and maintained, followed by a crack as the weapon is fired and a quiet, low, rising tone as the weapon charges again. 

Many factors need to be taken into consideration in order to increase the effective strength of a humanlike form in a realistic manner. One can always scale up just a few of these factors and say, "Wow, look at how strong this would be!", but when put into practise in a real-world situation, something would either fail or limit the na√Øvely-calculated maximum exertion. This is a problem of engineering, not simply physics and materials science, and trade-offs will always have to be made. 

The steps in generating a history are fairly simple. In effect, you add the main point(s) that you need for your story, then insert additional events that are relevant to your world, both related and unrelated to your story, with the proviso that nothing you add later can invalidate what is already there (unless you have time travel) Have a look at Microscope RPG, this system (and a few friends) can be used to generate some very interesting and detailed (in the right places) histories, though in essence it is doing what I have described above. 

Magic While necromancy is quite limited, there may also be magic for determining the truth of a suspect's or witness's statements. In fantasy, such spells typically give a true/false reading, or may be more sophisticated, able to give a partial-truth and/or evasive response indication. This would, of course, only show what the subject of the spell believed to be true, and there may be spells that alter a person's memory of events, so that they can tell a 'lie' and still appear to be truthful under such questioning. A particularly clever killer might even have his own memory of the event altered, so that by the time an investigation reaches him, he may no longer know that he committed the crime, and may have an entirely different memory of the time in question. However, if a suspect is a magician, then the possibility of this must be considered by an investigator, and if the suspect is not a magician, then the magician who performed the memory alteration may be locatable and could also testify. If it was not illegal to alter a memory at the request of the person whose memory was being altered, then it is quite likely that such a practitioner could be persuaded to testify against a criminal in order to avoid prosecution as an accessory to the crime. However, this would require that the investigators find said practitioner. Another common trope in magic is the law of contagion: once two items have been connected, they will remain connected, though the time for which this connection persists varies according to setting. The law of contagion can be used to magically locate the missing part of an object or collection, or the person whose hair/fingernail/etc. was left at the crime scene, or whatever else. This could be as simple as dowsing (this is a considerably broader and more complex field than this Wikipedia article suggests, whole books have been written on the subject), or could be some sort of visual scrying. Even limited to dowsing, a good dowser could follow the path a killer had taken after leaving a crime scene for some distance, probably up to the point where that person crossed moving water in some sort of craft or by swimming. 

The fastest, most efficient means of locomotion for a serpentine being is for it to roll itself into a hoop and roll around like a wheel. It can provide propulsive effort by flattening the loop slightly similar to a caterpillar track and flexing and extending its body in the appropriate way, or it can form a perfect circle and take advantage of inertia to keep it moving. It can steer by flexing its body from side to side, and could conceivably turn in little more than its own diameter. It could be expected that on level ground, such a being using this method of locomotion could easily outpace and outdistance any creature using a method of locomotion that involves reciprocating limbs or any other variety of serpentine locomotion. It could conceivably keep pace with some slower or even medium-speed birds. A speed of 100kph sustained for over an hour or more is not inconceivable, but this would be approaching a maximum practical speed. This is all well and good in theory, however there are also a few potential drawbacks:
