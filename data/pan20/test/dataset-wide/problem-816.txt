So apparently the "covariant entropy bound" (also known as Bousso's holographic bound) is the thing to look into when considering the maximum entropy of the universe (and I assume you just mean the observable universe here rather than whatever may lie beyond it). This set of lecture slides by Raphael Bousso, the physicist who originally proposed the covariant entropy bound, says that this bound is "conjectured to hold in arbitrary spacetimes, including cosmology." But it also says "If correct, origin must lie in quantum gravity", probably meaning one can't derive this fact in a non-conjectural way from basic laws of physics without having a complete theory of quantum gravity. For an introduction to this stuff, I recommend this Scientific American article that discusses various holographic bonds, including the Bekenstein bound along with Bousso's conjectured more general bound (the article was written by Bekenstein himself). Though it is from 2003 so I'm not sure what kind of theoretical progress has been made since then. Anyway, here's what it says about Buosso's entropy bound: 

All the photons being emitted do not 'fill in the blank' of the absorption line, because when they are emitted, most do not come towards us. You suppose that there will be some emitted from a different hydrogen atom elsewhere, that will just happen to aim a photon at us, but where will it come from? Think about how much of the sky the Sun subtends from our perspective. Now think about how much of the sky the Earth subtends from the perspective of an atom of hydrogen in the Sun's photosphere that is thinking about popping a photon out and wondering if it will head in the direction of Earth. Here is a 2D diagram - bear in mind that the atom actually is in 3D space and instead of being limited to only 360 degrees, can pop that photon off in any direction at all. 

Holographic entropy bounds are upper bounds for the maximum amount of entropy a given region can have, rather than its current entropy--for example, the spherical region of space just large enough to enclose the Earth and its atmosphere would currently contain a much lower entropy than a spherical black hole of the same radius, whose entropy is given by the Bekenstein bound. The scholarpedia article on the Bekenstein bound mentions the issue of cosmological entropy bounds: 

The solar constant is defined to be the power you get on such a surface of unit area if it's not being obstructed by atmospheric particles, and if it's oriented perpendicular to incoming rays so that it receives the maximum possible power at that location. One aspect of the orientation issue that's important to understand is that if you orient your solar collector so that it's parallel to the ground (so that it would be lying flat if it was actually at ground level), then it will only receive the maximum power if the surface of the Earth is itself perpendicular to incoming rays from the Sun at that point, which is not true in the above diagram. It would only be true at the point on Earth that's the dead "center" of the Earth as seen by an observer looking at it from the Sun's position, or the point where the gray line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun intersects with surface of the Earth on this diagram: 

This is partly a question of 'limiting magnitude' - the faintest magnitude that is visible using a particular instrument, or in this case, just the eye. +6 - maybe +6.5 - magnitude is sometimes used as a baseline expectation of what can be seen in dark skies sites. The most distant star that can easily be seen is Deneb. It is actually quite bright, at brighter than +2 Magnitude, but is (probably) 1425ly away. So though it is at quite some distance, it's luminosity means that actually, it isn't limiting magnitude that is at play. There are stars much further away that are at the barely perceivable limit, and seeing them will depend on conditions. The +4 mag mu Cephei is probably fairly achievable, at 5900ly, and V762 in Cassiopeia is about +6 mag and maybe 16000ly, which would probably be the record if you can actually see it, but you'll need special conditions. When it comes to galaxies, Andromeda is 2500000ly away, and +3.4, very visible and much further away than any individual star. If you have good conditions, the +5.7 mag M33 is slightly further away at 2900000ly, but it would be much harder to see. While the generally accepted limit is maybe +6.5, some people claim to have seen to +8. If it is possible, M83 is 14700000ly away at +8.2, with naked-eye claims reported. 

Imagine you have a solar collector measuring one square meter, which can directly measure the power (energy per unit time) striking it. If there are layers of atmosphere above the collector, some of the incoming light is absorbed or reflected by particles in the atmosphere, so you won't measure as much power as if you place the collector in space at the distance of Earth's orbit, with no atmosphere between you and the Sun. But if you place the collector in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the density of atmospheric particles above you is so small that they absorb/reflect only a negligible amount of power. Orientation is also an issue--you'll get the maximum power if you orient the plane of the collector so that it's perpendicular to the direction of the incoming rays. If it's not perpendicular, then if you approximate the incoming radiation as a set of parallel rays which each carry an equal amount of power (a standard approximation in optics) then fewer rays strike the collector when it's at some angle that's not perpendicular to the rays. All this is illustrated in the following diagram (from this page), with the two possible orientations of the solar collector illustrated in gray, and the light rays illustrated as black lines: 

Your question presumes that the ISS is beyond Earth's gravity, that it has escaped earth's gravitational pull. This is not correct. All objects with mass in the universe affect all other things with mass in the universe, the effect just gets weaker with distance. So the ISS is feeling the effect of gravity from Earth significantly more than the moon is. The reason the ISS doesn't just fall to the earth, either directly or gradually spiralling towards the earth, is that it is travelling fast enough around the earth that it is continually "missing" earth. It is sometimes described as 'falling' constantly around earth. If I am to be properly correct though, the reality is that ISS is in fact falling towards the earth, getting closer and closer to Earth all the time. It needs occasional boosts to push it further back out in it's orbit. Just to blow your mind a little bit: The ISS is pulling on the Earth with the same force that the Earth is pulling on ISS. 

But again, this bound should be the upper limit on the entropy of a given region, not necessarily the actual entropy in that region, so this type of holographic bound shouldn't imply that when we increase the entropy of the universe, the universe needs to grow. This paper specifically discusses how most matter-containing regions in cosmology apart from black holes would fail to "saturate" the covariant entropy bound, meaning that the actual entropy in the region is smaller than the maximum possible according to the bound. 

That is also the only point on Earth where an observer on the surface would see the Sun "directly overhead", at the very top of the apparent dome of the sky. So even if you stripped away the Earth's atmosphere, only at this point on the Earth would the power reaching a square meter of the surface be equal to the solar constant, the average power per square meter over the entire illuminated half of the Earth's surface would be less than the solar constant since most of the surface is at an angle relative to incoming rays. Incidentally, the angle of the surface relative to incoming rays is also the main reason why at Northern latitudes, it's warmer in the summer (when the surface at a Northern latitude is closer to being perpendicular to oncoming rays) than in the winter (when the surface is at a more inclined angle relative to incoming rays), as illustrated in a diagram from this page: 

We can't know this without knowing what the sky is like for your city. However, you can determine what the limiting magnitude is for your location, then you can set planetarium software to only display catalogued stars that are brighter than this limit. You can do this for naked eye objects, but you could also do this using your telescope to find the limiting magnitude for your equipment also. 

The two terms are used in answering different questions. Hill Sphere: given a large mass (eg Sun) and a small mass (eg Earth), can a tiny mass (eg Moon) find a stable orbit around the small mass? (If the tiny mass goes outside the Hill Sphere of the small mass, no.) SOI: given two large mass objects and a small object between them, (eg sending a probe from Earth to Mars), which massive object should we use as the origin of the frame of reference? (The small object is within which massive object's SOI?) As the questions are different, different approximations are used to answer the questions. 

It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

No, it isn't true. In fact over time you will see more stars at the equator than at any other latitude. The further you go towards the poles, the more stars are never seen because the planet gets in the way. 

Amateur telescope making (ATM) is a popular past-time for astronomers. You can grind your own mirror, or you can buy ready-made mirrors. You can coat your mirrors with silver using chemical solutions yourself, or have a coating of aluminium applied using a vacuum chamber by an outfit offering such a service. The main materials are a thick round slab of glass, usually Pyrex, and a smaller elliptical flat mirror. Using this you can make a Newtonian reflector. The support tube or structure for the mirrors can be one of a huge variety of designs, or you can be inventive yourself. There are websites to guide you in this, such as Mel Bartel's, Stellafane, and AmateurTelescopeMaker.com.
