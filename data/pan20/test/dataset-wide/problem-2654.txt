Ram Tobolski's answer seems to stand on its own and resolve the question. But I came across this quote from Daniel Dennett's "Kinds of Minds": This problem comes into sharper focus if we contrast the language of thought hypothesis with its ancestor and chief rival, the picture theory of ideas. So Dennett claims that LOTH is descended from, but different than, the picture theory of ideas. If Dennett is correct, Ram's answer that the two theories addresses compleltely different questions doesn't hold. The two theories do address the same or similar issues. So my question becomes: 

Kant's epistemology: There are facts out there, but we can never access them directly, we can only perceive them the way they are presented to us by our own minds. Quine: There are facts out there, but we can never access them directly, we can only represent them using our language structure. 

If saving the species is to be done at all costs, then the scenario you present does't really present a dilemma. Even after the last male Gorilla is killed, certain steps can be taken to preserve the genetic material of the Gorilla. His sperm can be collected and used to impregnate the remaining females, and his DNA can be preserved for cloning purposes. The real dilemmas arise at the meso- and macro-ecological levels: Consider a lost tribe on a Pacific Island whose entire culture and way of life centers around hunting a single species of whale, and that whale species is about to go extinct. The tribe has only a few 100 individuals left and their whole culture and language are in danger of being forgotten. Who do we save? The tribe or the whale species? Keep in mind that the individual members of the tribe are safe. At any moment they can simply be integrated into another society. It is there culture and way of life, not the individual members who are in danger. 

David Deutsch's strong version of the Church-Turing thesis, and the overall topic of digital physics (the universe is a computer) are closely related to Tegmark's hypothesis. More disputed and controversial, but still somewhat related is Stephen Wolfram's idea that everything can be described by computations and cellular automata (equivalent to Turing machines and therefore related to Tegmark's hypothesis) as described in his book "A New Kind of Science". 

To summarize, the answer to your overall question "Before starting the Reductio Ad Absurdum, how can you guess or divine that F causes the contradiction?": There is no known method for doing so beforehand. Being able to do so implies an efficient method for solving boolean satisfiability, and it is conjectured (but not yet proven conclusively) that an efficient method is impossible. 

But it struck me recently that these two objectives might be contradictory: If a society (through its state) guarantees a certain amount of welfare to its members, doesn't it have to have some sort of membership criteria? It can't simply provide this welfare to anyone who asks for it. Consider this analogy with the adult in a family: I am responsible for providing for my own biological children, and for my adopted children, and eventually for my nieces and nephews or grandchildren, and maybe for my neighbor's children and those of my very good friend who is unable to provide for his children, etc....but I shouldn't be expected to provide for each and every child around, it would be impossible to do so. At some point some criteria for my responsibility over children has to be established, otherwise I would be stretched too thin. In the same way, a state can't indefinitely commit to providing welfare to anyone who needs it, at some point it has to establish a boundary between those it is responsible for and those it isn't responsible for. But if we have an open immigration policy were anyone who arrives in the country can stay and benefit from the services of the country, doesn't that abolish that boundary? How can one reconcile the goal of welfare states with an open immigration policy? Is this the reason that Marx made communism an international movement? 

He then explains why we perceive all three to be the same, by first merging 1 and 2, and then merging 2 and 3. My question pertains to how he merges 1 and 2, i.e. why the psychological arrow of time and the thermodynamic arrow of time move in the same direction. Here is his reasoning: 

(This is an extended comment, not a properly sourced answer) I have a feeling that you are looking for an explanation where it is shown that loving/treating two or more people equally results in some sort of contradiction or fallacy. That is not the case. Based on logic alone, there's no apriori reason that an agent can't assign the exact same value/ranking to two distinct entities (or more). There might be empirical evidence suggesting that it is impossible to value two other people equally, but that would be a question for psychologists, not philosophers. There is a case to be made that "loving" or "valuing" a person looses its meaning if it is applied to too broad a category. I was part of a large social circle that included over a 100 people, and another member of the group told us once that she loved each and every one us and that we were all her special friends. I remember thinking to myself that her statement doesn't really make sense: By definition, a friend is someone you single out for special treatment compared to other people. if everyone in the group was her special friend, then there was nothing special about the friendship. Another way of looking at it is: If everyone is a VIP (Very Important Person), then no one is a VIP - VIP by definition should apply to a small number of people compared to the overall group. So although there is no contradiction in valuing more than one person, there is some sort limit on how many people you can value, before the term looses it's meaning. In the case of your earlier post about polyamory - which this seems to be a follow up on - there is no inherent contradiction in the idea of polyamory itself. It is possible to say however, that beyond a certain number of partners, the person is no longer polyamorous, they are simply promiscuous. 

More generally, it impossible for any sentient being (human, demon, super-AI,...) to perfectly predict events in a universe of which it is part of. To be able to perfectly predict future events in the universe, it has to do so from outside of that universe. The very fact that it is part of it (i.e. inside it) prevents it from performing such predictions. Wolpert's result was published as a refutation of the idea of Laplace's demon: Laplace proposed that a demonic being with absolute knowledge of every particle's current position and current speed in the universe, should be able to infer all the past states and all of the future states of the universe from that information. Wolpert arrived at his results using a method similar to Turing's result with regards to undecidability and the limits of Turing machines. The result is also closely connected to Gödel's incompleteness theorem. Gödel proved that no theory can prove it's own consistency, and using a similar approach, Wolpert proved that no universe (an any intelligent inhabitants of that universe are considered part of it) can predict itself. Note that Wolpert's result applies to any universe, regardless of the laws of physics that govern it - i.e. quantum mechanics, or relativity, etc...don't have anything to do with his result. See here for Wolpert's original paper and for an article on his result. As to whether this counts as "canonical" or not I don't know. As far as I know, Wolpert is the only person to address this issue directly. Most people consider that Quantum Mechanics puts an inherent limit on the predictability of the universe, regardless of whether humans are trying to predict anything in it or not, so the paradox you mention isn't of much interest to philosophers. 

Alvin Plantinga presented a modern version of the Augustinian theodicy, which he called the free will defense (Plantinga, Alvin. 1977. God, Freedom, and Evil. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans.). It can be summarized in the following way: 

The type of decision making described in the OP corresponds to compatibilist freewill, but not libertarian freewill. To answer the question at the end: 

Your idea that religion is a reaction to fear is echoed in Marx's famous "Religion is the Opium of the masses". Marx didn't reference fear of death in particular, but suffering and pain in general, which presumably includes fear of death. The idea is that life is painful, and people use religion as an anesthetic, the way they use drugs to forget physical pain. Freud later develops ideas very similar to yours in his writings on religion, especially in his book "The Future of an Illusion". He states that religion was created as a form of wish fulfillment. People invented religion because they were desperate to believe that their soul was immortal and was going to live on after their death. Another reason Freud mentions, related to the one you mentioned, was that people created gods as a longing for father figures. As adults people subconsciously longed for the protection provided for them as children by their parents, but their parents were dead (or dying soon), so they invented gods as transcendent and eternal father figures who they felt would always be their for them. More generally Freud saw religion as a defense mechanism agains the sheer randomness and cruelty of life, a way people coped with the fact that nature was far more powerful than they were. Ernest Becker takes this a step further, and claims in his 1974 "Denial of Death", that most of human civilization, not just religion, is one elaborate psychological response to the fear of death. 

When people in general discuss science, they talk about the scientific method as if it was a fixed and universally agreed upon principle. In a show I saw recently by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he explicitly states that it was invented by Ibn Al Haytham in the 10th~11th century. The colloquial definition of the scientific method seems to be something along the lines of: 

My understanding is that Berkeley considered the outside world to have no existence at all, and took the statement "It's all in the mind" literally, whereas Kant argued that the outside world exists independently of the observer, but we can never know it's true nature. The best we can due is observe the effects it has on our senses. I'm pretty sure this description of the difference is correct, but it feels oversimplified to me (My grasp of Kant is rudimentary at best).
