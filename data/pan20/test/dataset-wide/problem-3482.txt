Recently Microsoft floated a \$17 billion bond to finance the purchase of LinkedIn (remind me to delete my account). Some might wonder why a company with nearly \$100 billion in cash would need to borrow \$17 billion. The reason is that nearly all of that $100 billion they have is in bank accounts in other countries. If they were to repatriate that money to buy LinkedIn, then they would potentially have to pay corporate taxes on it. So, it is actually cheaper for them to borrow the money domestically than repatriate foreign held funds. This brings us to the question: what can they do with the foreign cash? One obvious answer is to buy foreign companies. Is that the only use? 

Has there been a post-mortem on the Saturn pricing model? For those who do not remember, in the 1990s GM sponsored a new car model, the Saturn, which featured "no haggle" pricing. The car would be sold at one fixed price depending on options. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pricing strategy was popular with buyers, but did it work for the company from an economics point of view? 

My understanding was that fuel oil is much easier to refine than gasoline and more of it is produced per barrel of crude than gasoline is produced. Why then is it more expensive? 

I read the 2016 Social Security Trust Fund's annual report, but I didn't see anything in there that resembled and income statement. I want to know two numbers: how much the fund disbursed during the year and how much it received in taxes. How can I find those two values? 

I read a statement that one reason for persistent demand for US Treasuries is that US banks buy them because they can be used as collateral for acquiring short-term debt. I don't understand this. If a bank can borrow at the Fed window, then why not borrow short-term if you need short term or long-term if you need long term. Why would you lend money by buying treasuries and then borrow short-term using those as collateral. It makes no sense. Borrow short term from whom? 

Can anyone explain to me why Algeria, a country of 40 million people is importing almost half as much milk powder as China? 

Massachusetts has the third highest electricity cost in the US (after Hawaii and Connecticut). Why is this? 

There is no way to predict that. A "price" is just the level of the last transaction. What happens in the next transaction does not depend on the previous transaction. So if you sell dollars at 1.10 dollars per Euro, the next person to sell dollars might sell them at 1.12 or 1.08 or some other amount based on a myriad of factors. There is no way to predict what trades might occur in the future, just from knowing the trade you made in the present. 

What is he talking about? What is the itemization of this debt. The whole US debt is less than \$20 trillion, so I don't see where there could be \$200 trillion in debt. 

What does he mean by "inter-temporal smoothing" and "bringing spending forward". How do you "bring spending forward"? 

I notice that Portugal had a very high interest rate on its national bond issues back in 2012 but since then it has drawn down significantly: 

I don't understand how petro states can have crazy low gasoline prices without smugglers exporting the gasoline and selling it elsewhere. For example, in Venezuela the domestic price of gasoline is about 5 cents per gallon (compared to the current US retail price of around $2.10 per gallon). In other words, the US retail price is about 40 times the Venezuelan price. That is a pretty big incentive for a smuggler. There are other countries which have similar subsidized prices. How does Venezuela prevent smugglers from just loading up trucks with gasoline and exporting it? They don't even have to ship it out of Venezuela. They could truck it across the border into one of the neighboring countries and sell it there or export it from the neighbor. Venezuela must have some mechanism for controlling who is receiving the cheap gas and preventing them from exporting it, what is it? As a second question along the same lines, how do they prevent people from converting the oil into a different product and then exporting that product. So, for example, oil can be converted into polypropylene pellets. A person could take the (virtually) free oil, convert it into polypropylene and then export the polypropylene. How do they prevent this from happening? 

Also, note that there are graphical packages like TikZ in Tex which have very powerful graph drawing capability. TikZ is mostly used in unix environments, though, and will not store data structures or do calculations like Mathematica. It is purely a graphical drawing capability. The graph you have used as an illustration has the font typically used in TeX, so it was probably produced with TikZ or another TeX package. If you want a Mathematica equation to look like that you can use the TraditionalForm function, or explicitly specify the Computer Modern font. 

The difference between the 10-year bond and the 30-year bond is tiny, just 0.15%. This seems like a negligible premium to receive for assuming an additional 20 years of risk. Is there a theory that explains this counterintuitive (to me) condition? 

I am interested in understanding how to mathematically model market interaction to optimize pricing strategy. In my model I have two kinds of knowledge: the market's order book and the price/volume curve. So, I know for any given price how many widgets will change hands at that price on a given day. Note that the price/volume curve changes over time and I cannot predict it into the future, I only know what it is historically. So, my problem is, given I have a certain number of widgets I would like to sell I have different possibilities: I could sell them immediately at the buy price, or I could put them up for sale at a higher sell price and hope someone buys them. If I put them up for sale, then I need to decide what I should price them at. If I make my sell order the lowest order, then that can have consequences. For example, lets say widgets are buying at 850 each and selling for 900. So, I list my widgets for sale at 885. Other sellers could try to undercut me, modifying their orders to be lower than 885. Another effect is that buyers could lower their buy price. When the guy buying at 850 sees my 885, he could decide the price is coming down, so he might change his buy order to 840. Now, if I change my mind and sell my widgets immediately I will only get 840 for them each, but if I had sold at first I would have made 850. So, I will have lost both time and money. Given the information I have (order book and price/volume curve), how can I model the situation mathematically to optimize my total profit? Are there well-known theories or models that attempt to solve this problem? 

I don't quite get James Stuart Mill's example of cloth, corn and gold in "Elements of Political Economy". He supposes that 20 yards of cloth takes the same amount of effort to make as 4 quarters of corn in England, but in Poland the effort to make 4 quarters of corn is the same as that to make 10 yards of cloth. Now, supposing that in the beginning corn costs 1 pound per quarter in both places, then the resulting cloth price will be 0.2 pounds in England and 0.4 pounds in Poland. Therefore, the Poles will buy cloth and gold will flow from Poland to England while cloth goes the other direction. This will continue until the price is the same in both places (0.27 pounds for a yard of cloth in both places). However, in that case the corn price will drift out of balance. Where is the equilibrium? (This example is in Chapter III, Section XV)
