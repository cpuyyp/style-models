What we're looking for is a cold-blooded creature that uses a phase change material (PCM) to line the throat and lungs that absorbs heat with the passage of air. An example of a phase change material is ice. Ice retains its temperature until it has completely melted. Pick up a partially melted piece of ice and it's the same temperature. Better still, pass warm air over it and you get cold air on the other side until the ice is completely melted. Now, here's where I'm going to employ some handwaving, because I'm not an organic chemistry major. What we're looking for is the the skin equivalent of ice. Rather than melting, the skin equivalent is passing the thermal energy into the blood stream. Remember, the creature is cold blooded, and this highly evolved process would allow it to withstand cooler temperatures than a normal cold-blooded creature could. Remember, this PCM skin would line the throat and lungs. And it would have the side effect of exhaling cooler air than it inhaled. How much cooler? That's a function of the efficiency of the system. But, please note the following: 

This assumes the same wing area and thrust as used on Earth, and assuming any of those birds can get off the ground in the first place with such low air pressure. (And assuming the rocket planes don't enter low orbit due to the lower gravity....) Could it be done? Sure. I would expect a booming electrically-driven ultralight aircraft industry. Is it practical? Only if there are some fabulous advances in ultra-light, ultra-strong materials to bring down the weight. But, sadly, yes, there would be flight. As for rockets... The only reason they couldn't use rockets on Mars is because you need an oxidant (e.g., oxygen) to mix with reactant to get combustion for lift. No oxidant... no boom. Since air is such a rare commodity, it would be tantamount to a sin to liquify it just to throw a rocket into space. Assuming there isn't a minable mineral that would substitute for oxygen as an oxidant, the only way you're getting a rocket off of mars is to import the oxidant. 

Conclusion There would be a difference, but I don't believe it would be a great difference. Talented singers would produce richer sound and our communication would be more nuanced, but in general, it wouldn't be a dramatic difference. On the other hand, the price we'd pay to get that minor difference is very high with a much more complicated throat structure and all the possibilities for problems that would go with it. 

From an evolutionary perspective, the tendency to not propagate the species would have been bred out of the human genome shortly after the tendency to not eat. In our earliest evolutionary forms we would not have had the reasoning power to behaviorally avoid or modify our nature. Said more simply, an animal drawn to the same gender would simply follow around and have intercourse with the same gender. End result: no progeny. That means the likelihood of that particular genetic condition activating in any particular birth would be rare. Really rare. How rare? The most common form of Achondroplasia (dwarfism) occurs in an average 1:27,500 births. Remember, this is the most common form of dwarfism. True homosexuality (inclusive of all LGBTism) would be more rare than this, but let's roll with it for a moment. 1:27,500 is the same as 0.0036% of the world population3 — and they want and do propagate the species. Therefore, let's assume that factual LGBTism is no more common than a known and genetically detectable condition such as Achondroplasia. Which brings us to the question, what is the nature of your fictional world? 

It's worth noting that the changes were, of course, miniscule. (The axial tilt changed by single centimeters.) But it did it. So, let's examine that earthquake. In the article, Dr. Benjamin Fong Chao said... 

Adding water, methane, etc. isn't that hard if you have propulsion technology. Find asteroids that are mostly ice and drop them onto the planet (tracking with the spin to minimize impact velocity, of course). But, 50 years? That would suggest you're starting with a planet that can support saplings for almost anything but Poplars. In reality, terraforming would take centuries to get to the point of general tree growth and a well enough fixed ecology to support animal life. 

Therefore, the answer is at best, "yes, but only briefly, and that's assuming that anyone would want to give up the advantages of not using it." 

The unfortunate answer to your question is "very unlikely." During the time of Cook's voyages (1768-1779) every naval power on earth (the Dutch, the Portuguese, Spain, and of course, England) was trying to map the world. Not just for the purpose of business, but for military and political purposes as well. Naval technology, optical technology, navigational technology, and cartographic technology had all come to a point where the world took the next big step forward. Yes, Hawaii is small, and it would seem like it was difficult to find. However, Cook was specifically a skilled navigator and cartographer. I can't find how tall the HMS Resolution's mast was, but it was not uncommon at the time for mast heights to reach 300 feet. That would allow them to scan a radius of over 20 miles at any time (depending on weather, or course). With an average speed of 5 or so knots (about 5.5 miles per hour) and, say, a 10 hour day (55 miles) that means you could view about 2,000 square miles a day. But Cook wasn't depending on eyesight alone. Wherever he stopped he would talk to natives about their neighbors, both myth and reality. He wasn't just doing this for alturistic purposes, every inhabited island represented resources and supplies a ship at sea could use to stay at sea — especially during war. So he hopped from island to island, slowly charting everything he found. Until he found Hawaii. Considering how much effort was going on at the time, the odds of not finding Hawaii within the period of 1750-1850 are, frankly, zero. Now, having said that, I wouldn't just throw away your ideas. Cook was met with enough equanimity, curiosity, and hospitality to allow for Hawaii's then dependent development. However, the Sentinelese are a stone-age people still living today. Despite the island being very, very close to the coasts of Burma, etc., the people survived cultural contamination — basically by being the meanest mother hubbards on the planet. Regrettably, this would mean changing the basic nature of the Hawaiian people such that they beat off Cook and everybody following such that people stopped wanting to land on Hawaii. The island would still be discovered (couldn't be avoided), but the people would have developed more-or-less independently. 

Life is unreasonably rare in the galaxy, so when a waste management company gets lucky and finds an inhabited planet, they cherish it and work beyond measure to keep it secret from their competitors and habitally viable for as long as possible. After all, the fees waste management companies must pay to the government to store waste on uninhabited worlds are reprihensible! Therfore, it is in the best interest of the E'Kathian Secret Brotherhood of Caustic and Indeterminate Waste Storage and Management, LLC to dump waste anywhere BUT inhabited locations on the planet despite the interference of bureaucratic regulation that demands dumping directly on inhabited locations to ensure the longevity of the company's investment and value to its shareholders (whomever they may be in the spirit of free trade everywhere, all praise to E'Kath!) Offensive bureaucratic regulation demands and imposes the requirement that an intelligent species be one that exhibits "the capacity to modify their environment to the detriment of itself while adjudicating complaint and damage with the greatest possible delay and inefficiency." These Humus (as they call themselves, sounds like some kind of plant to me) exhibit all these characteristics and therefore must meet the interminable regulation that at least three million, seven hundred and forty-six thousand, fourteen individuals must exist at minimum planet wide with a minimum of one hundred ninety-six thousand eight hundred and one in one location, visitation and examination of said planet to be subject to the whim of the Approved and Apparent Disposal of Waste Commission, may they rot in... But I digress. It is certainly in the best interest of the company (E'Kath!) that we be perceived as complying and, indeed, do so insofar as we are able to milk this sensible disposal site for every G'ham it is worth. Standard corporate entrenchment protocols have been affected with a suitable number of Humus collected and kept in storage to repopulate elswhere with implantable evidence of their capacity to reach said world should the Divine look unfavorably upon us (Say it Ain't So, E'Kath!) and we lose this world. To do anything less would be entirely unethical. 

I believe everyone here would agree that a civilization of sentient beings would require communication. However, is a tongue required for communication? 

I'm voting for the nukes, and not just because I'm a natural pyromaniac I think that many people spend their lives watching Star Trek and Star Wars and think that space battles are a lot like watching pre-1900 wars where ships of the line stood broadside and unloaded short-range light-damage cannon in bulk. In reality space battles will be much more like post-1900 naval warfare where the ships themselves will be ever further apart as technology improves. Why? Because railguns hurt Railguns pack enough punch that they can rip through pretty much any ship of any size — if you give them the opportunity. As anyone who'se tried rabbit hunting with a .22LR will tell you, the closer the bunny the deader the bunny. And this assumes the bunny doesn't have nasty things like electronic counter measures, false heat signatures (can you imagine the size of flares left in space to confuse heat-seeking missles?), or magnetic deflectors to push aside incoming ordnance. The natural behavior of ships will be to attack at such long distances that the effectiveness of their defensive abilities is maximized and it becomes impractical to retaliate with point-solution projectiles. It's simply too much of a pain to hit the target. Thus, nukes The issue isn't that nukes have more or less punch. The issue is that they don't require the pinpoint accuracy of railguns. You need to think of them more in terms of flak guns. All you need is to either set a "distance" marker for detonation or have a means of detecting the shift of mass from in front of the warhead to behind the warhead to indicate the need for detonation (or, if everyone's using magnetic deflectors, a simple magnetrometer and a timer to arm the warhead after it's outside your own magnetic deflector). However, the railgun isn't useless... You do still need the railgun (or, at least, you can justify it). The problem with those distances is that they're distant. The time needed to get a missle up to speed can mean the difference between a sucessful strike and being the dead bunny yourself. Railguns become the rocket for the "rocket assisted artillery" of the future. It gets the nuke moving really fast, really fast. Conclusion I gladly predict that the future of space combat will demand the ships be so far apart that today's over-the-horizon naval engagements will seem like a Marx Brothers skit. In fact, the distances could be so great that even Battlestar Galactica-esque carriers with swarms of fighters will be useless. They're simply too slow over to great a distance. Delivering area-of-effect weapons quickly over long distances will likely become the only method of ship-to-ship combat. Man, I love making sweeping difficult-to-prove-right-or-wrong statements. It just perks up the morning, you know? :-) 

Seti found a signal... in English You didn't mention what the tech level of Earth was before the apolcalypse, so let's assume that a colony or two was founded before the apocalypse. As humanity rebuilt itself, it recreated what before the apocalpyse was called Seti: the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. So long after the apocalypse, we're at it again... hunting for any sign of intelligent life in the universe. We found such a signal, and it was in plain ASCII. We're coming home After world leaders change their underwear, they invest trillions into new space technology. Not just to defend ourselves from humans long lost to history... but to get to them first. [Queue appropriate music to underscore our determination to win at any cost...] 

I can't believe resources would be a sensible reason unless it was a technology-critical resource so honking rare that you'd need to expend the cost of invading systems across interstellar distances to get it. (Unobtainium, anyone?) Honestly, I find that to be remarkably unbelievable. Some ultra-wealthy magnate may send in a mercenary team to steal some... but outright interstellar war? What could possibly be worth that expense? I'm not even happy with the need to expand. I'm a fan of a phrase I coined, "technology dichotomy." As a micro-publisher, we were plagued with books about time machines that could be activated by bumping a button with your hip... or stories about babbage machines in a civilization that hadn't invented the wheel. The idea that you can be large enough to seriously fight an interstellar war but can't terraform a planet seems, to me, dichotomous. Once you can terraform planets, it's an issue of time + cost to terraform vs cost + loss to conquer. I'm no expert, but I suspect it would be cheaper to terraform every time. Further, space would seem the very epitome of the easy way toward population control. After all, "space is disease and death wrapped in darkness and silence." I suppose it's possible to have bloated planetary populations that can't be spread out through terraforming... but... 

Rather than complain about the science, let's have some fun with this. Yes, the actual science says that a planet so distant from its sun woulnd't be earthlike at all. But, let's assume we care as much about fiction as we do about science and jump to the conclusion that your explorers could quickly make the planet very earthlike if they just had more sunlight to work with. I'm thinking something along the lines of a Dyson Swarm, but skip all the habitation potential. What we really want are optics. So what we really want is... 

A lot of tube development in the 40s was stymied due to competing patents and the all-too-common habit of manufacturers creating unique pin-outs (the configuration of how the pins on electronic devices are used). Let's assume that royal mess didn't happen. Further, let's assume that someone makes a world-altering breakthrough: tube miniturization. This is an important issue. Transistors needed (simplistically) only one miniturization path: semiconductor manufacturing. Tubes would require multiple miniturization paths: vacuum tech, glass/enclosure tech, anode/cathode element tech... etc. But, what if some enterprising German (it's always a german, right? And the Nazi's were renowned for their scientists...) came up with a way to mount the anode and cathode arrays on a substrate rather than standing them up like a light bulb.... 

To Get High We live in a world where kids lick each other's eyeballs for an erotic kick and breathe aerosol from paper bags for a quick high, you'd have an epidemic on your hands just because the virus gives you a high like quality Heroin. Heck, if our world is any example, you'd have people lining up to get sick. 

Questions like this are remarkably difficult to answer. We barely understand evolution and adaptation in hindsight --- you're asking us to move them forward. But, there are a few things we can consider. 1) Birds migrate easily, so you should expect them to simply move inland. What wasn't destroyed in your apocalypse would flourish in the Appalachian mountains. 2) Valley or low-altitude ground animals on the East coast would, I think, mostly die as the only place they can go is the mountains which are less congenial and have more predators. 3) Between the Appalachians and the Sierra Nevadas you would see little change other than what died in the apocalypse and what migrated south from Canada and north from Mexico. Carrion eaters tend to survive first. 4) The West would, I suspect, see little change. Now, that's based on the fact that desertification is easy with a nuclear war but hard with only global warming. As the water rises, so does evaporation. Local climates might change some, but after nearly 1,000 years, a new balance with rain would exert itself. I wouldn't be surprised if, after than millenial pause, the U.S. would look remarkably similar to what it did in the 1500's. Keep in mind that ecologists have been crying irreversible environmental doom and gloom since the late 60s. Their predictions haven't come to pass in nearly 50 years and it's not showing significant signs of happening soon. All due respect to the hard-core believers out there. And after your apocalypse, all the trends would start to reverse. Mother Nature is perfectly capable of healing herself. As dramatic as many people want global warming to be, it won't actually be severe unless we keep at it for 1,000 years or more. National Geographic back in 2010/2011 had an article that predicted nearly 5,000 years before global warming was truly irreversible. I actually believe that number. As for your revitalized animals, life is remarkably capable of sticking around so long as (a) there aren't too many predators, (b) there's satisfactory water for the species, and (c) there's abundant food. Finally, I'm 100% in agreement with @Will. Focus only enough on this issue to permit the reader to happily suspend their disbelief. Focus most of your energy on a whomping good story.
