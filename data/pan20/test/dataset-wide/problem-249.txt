Lightsail looks like a good candidate for propulsion, if to solve a problem of growing a living tissue in vacuum. It may be easier to grow such a structure in place than to deploy it from the package, as with the usual mechanical light sail. Light could provide the energy to grow and transport nutrients to growing regions. The ship could discard the sail before landing, and then regrow another one after take off. 

You probably need to make it empty inside (like a ball) to avoid immediate gravitational collapse. Also, this makes obtaining the required amount of building material more realistic. A body so large still would require some very advanced technologies to use, but may be manageable then. You could then use some strong light source in the center that would keep the planet blown up like a huge solar sail. But is should be some special technology; no solar sail would work in such a distance from the ordinary star. 

Museum of science and industry could provide suitable machines. Some old diesel engines were capable of running on crude oil. Such engines could probably still be found in some "Museum of science and industry" in a running condition. If the museum actually runs the engine, it should be some maintenance tools in its workshop. 

Some material does survive from the bigger ships falling from space. When Skylab went down, debris were found on the ground. Or Columbia. Mir space station required deorbiting into uninhabited area of the ocean, and it is known that parts of Hubble may survive reentry. Of course, depends on the spacecraft and depends on the planet, but generally possible. You may assume that the ship has completed some part of the landing sequence to make this more realistic. 

A rogue planet will not get energy from Sun, so the colony would need to use nuclear energy to produce warmth and light as required. Ordinary reactors use uranium that may not be easily available with reduced scale technology, but termonuclear reactors may need just water, or maybe tritium that could be purified from large amounts of water (assuming the planet has a frozen ocean with plenty of water available). Such devices are not used in production yet but they are under development. If we get a small self-sustained colony, it may have much more time later to perfect the technologies. 

There is something in the water : There is some chemical substances in the main water source of the city that has the effect of making everyone who drinks enough water to sleep during the day rather than the night, the minority who doesn't sleep during the day are the ones who drink much less water, maybe because they live far away from the city's main water source, or maybe they suffer from dehydration. 

Well the 14th century is full of crisis : The Black Death that wiped half of the population. $URL$ The Great Famine of 1315-17 $URL$ So if he brings medications and antibiotiques, he will be idolized by them. 

Practicing Sports with your fancy shoes : One way to demonstrate that you are wealthy is to practice sports while wearing your fancy shoes instead of regular sports shoes. In that case you will prove that you are too rich to not care about your fancy shoes getting worn by playing sports. Avoid walking on pedestrian passages and walk on rough unattended roads : Yes you are rich enough to torture yourself by walking on rocky roads just to prove that you are much superior than the others. That doesn't make sens but it will definitely get your shoes worn. 

The infamous main character in my story is traveling among others on a mining spaceship that is carrying tons of valuable materials from Mars to Earth under the protection of the US government, our infamous hero wants to convince his fellow miners to seize control of the spaceship and travel to a Chinese space colony near Saturn (he arranged a deal with someone in charge of that colony) where the US has no authority and then become rich thanks to the spoils of Mars, but his diabolic plan is faced with many challenges : Obstacles : 1 - The ship is heavily guarded : about 100 soldiers equipped with laser rifles. 2 - The ship is under the command of one ruthless ex-military feared by everyone. 3 - The miners are many (about 600) but have no criminal background. 4 - He has only two months before reaching earth. Spaceship : The spaceship is very huge, it's a mobile industrial refinery used to refine materials extracted from Mars before shipping to earth, but it's also very fast (not speed of light fast). Miners : The miners are a variety of space engineers in many fields such as : 

The straightforward approach seems to attach the object to the lasso and keep spinning it around as a cowboy does before throwing. The centrifugal force will simulate the gravity for the object. The astronaut may rotate in the opposite direction but for the relatively light object this effect will be small. It can be compensated with the rocket thrusters, spinning another similar object in the opposite direction (tricky but may be possible) or holding to the massive spacecraft with another hand. The usefulness of the idea depends on why does the object need the gravity. If, say, suspended particles must be brought down from the fluid, the approach would work. 

I suggest to use some concurrent versioning system like CVS, SVN or GIT. These are used by software developers to write program texts and are freely and readily available on GitHub, for instance. They already support all needed security and can be quite user friendly (see overview of user friendly interfaces). They allow to setup the following development process: 

The ordinary (not nuclear-powered) submarine cannot stay submerged for really long, as it uses battery power to run various required systems. It may also run out of other necessary resources like compressed air, and it may eventually loose some air being not completely airtight. Some devices may not run in the absence of gravity. However I think that at least with the help of heroic attempts the crew may be able to survive for many hours if not days. 

Any barrier that prevents mixed families in significant enough degree (need not be absolute) would suffice. For a lower level of technology, a chain of high mountains, an ocean and other similar obstacles would work. Race separation may also happen without geographical isolation, if mixing is prevented by other reasons like social barriers. Divergence into different races should be much faster if there is an evolutional pressure for the different appearance. Dark skin protects from sun efficiently, but if there is not enough sun, white skin allows to synthesize enough vitamin D. With sun creme and vitamins both available in the shop, does not actually matter in these days. 

Since you are writing a sci-fi the only technology I can think of is : the bubble maker. Each citizen in your city lives inside a personal bubble, they can eat, work, sleep and do everything normally without breaking it. Each bubble has a 24 hours supply of oxygen after that, every citizen must go to this huge medieval machine to change his personal bubble. 

Watchtowers : Put watchtowers in every city, they provide a military advantage especially inside the city's walls : 

They are using advanced high-tech tools in order to get their job done, however under the new regime of the US government, scientists and engineers are being treated like slaves and forced to work for a cheap payement since it's their duty towards their ruling government. Advantages : The main good thing that could work in benefit of his conspiracy that the miners are poor and underpaid by the government so they are angry with their condition, also they are not traveling in cryostat (they are not sleeping) because they have to refine those materials before delivering to earth. Important : He needs to get rid of all the soldiers (kill them and burn them or send them to the nearest rock in escape pods) before reaching Saturn and also get rid of the ship after taking all of the cargo, because the person in charge of the Chinese space colony can't protect our infamous hero from the Chinese government in case he brings back anything representing the US government (a proof of the mutiny). Question : According to Wikipedia : 

How long does it take to completely deplete the resources of a planet ? Nomads change places only if they exhaust the resources (food, water, ...) existing in the previous location. In your case we are talking about planets, so to completely consume the resources of a planet during let's say 3 years, it has to be one of these propositions : 1 - Small and tiny planets : The galaxy in which your nomads live contain only small planets with few resources, so they need to change places many times during their life cycle. 2 - Swarms of nomads (overpopulation) : The traveling civilisation is actually a big one, hundreds of billions of people can easily exhaust the resources of a planet in no time, then move to the other in an endless cycle. 3 - Lazy and passive civilisation : What's wrong with working in farms to grow vegetables and fruits and breed animals, doing so will assure a more stable future for the whole civilisation. 

The creature can drink water and eat close to the usual food: there are various organic carbon molecules, as well as water, in the interstellar space. They are even called "seeds of life", as may be the origin of life in the Earth. Light that powers many organisms in Earth is also available in space, even interstellar (we see light coming from other stars). The concentration, however, is extremely low, and some really mystical capabilities are required to concentrate the reasonable amounts. Maybe could dwell near black holes or the forming stars where the gravity of these bodies could concentrate the food. 

There is no need to assume that water creatures cannot use processes or technologies that require air environment. Some manufacturing processes do require vacuum, or have required in the past (vacuum tubes, for instance). Humans live in the air but were capable of making vacuum when needed. And, for sure, they create water environment when needed (most of the chemistry). Aquatic creatures could make air environment, or even vacuum environment in they laboratories as required. For instance, diving bell may be possible to make from some shell or water plant, allowing to experiment with air technologies to discover lots of amazing things. In the Earth, spiders create air environment under water without any intelligence. 

Regardless how hot or cold the star is, you can always place a planet into acceptable climate conditions by just putting it into the right distance. This will impact the duration of the year: for the small cold star, the planet must be closer so the year will be shorter (see orbital period). This depends much less on the mass of the planet as it is very light in comparison to the star anyway. As the life takes long time to evolve, it should probably be a stable star from the main sequence, burning hydrogen, not helium or anything the like. Other stages of stellar evolution (like red giants or cooling dwarfs) may be too short for creating life "from scratch" but would still fit if the planet has been colonized later.
