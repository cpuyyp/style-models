It sounds like you need to adjust your rear derailleur - the cable may have slipped a bit and have insufficient cable tension, or if you recently had a crash, you may have bent your derailleur. I'd recommend reading this to learn how to adjust your derailleur. 

Without any additional knowledge on the bike, my advice would be don't drill into the down tube. You run the risk of making it structurally unsound. That being said, some bikes with downtube shifters have a hole drilled in the downtube with a rod going between the mounts and maybe some epoxy using something like this: 

Finally, some people just get wet and dirty or don't take their road bikes out in the rain. Note that road bikes generally don't throw up as much crud up as mountain bikes since their tires are smaller. My road bike has a SKS X-tra Dry seatpost rear fender, and the front is just plain. It uses 700x28 tires, and I find that the front doesn't throw all that much up that I care about it too much. The rear is pretty well covered by the seatpost fender, so I don't have skunk stripe. 

Depends on what you mean by 10 speed. In the 70s, there were many bikes on the market that had 2 chainrings (gears in front) and 5 cogs (gears in back), so had 10 gear combinations or speeds. In many cases now, when someone encounters the term speeds they mean the number of cogs. These days, there are a decent number of bikes with 10 cogs in the back. Nobody's stopping you from putting more than 10 cogs in the rear on a bicycle. The current Shimano XTR M9000 drivetrain for mountain bikes lets you run a 3 x 11 (3 chainrings in the front, 11 cogs in the back). So, this is a 33 speed bike (in the old parlance). Is having all these gearing combinations going to make your life better in any way? Maybe, maybe not. Unless you're trying to be absurd, like this 63-speed bike by Sheldon Brown. 

For most people, they're just a bit pricier. The weight difference is insignificant for almost everyone (excluding possibly serious racers). As for durability, I'd expect its more of a function of maintenance rather than trim level. But I'd actually guess the "lower end" Tiagra part is probably a bit more durable since its probably got a bit more material on it. 

For reference for non-Germans, 28" means 700c. Most touring bikes do ship with 700c wheels these days (for not short riders - short riders often get 26" or 650b wheels) and they work fine for people - the key is to have well built wheels for touring (for loaded touring, this means high spoke counts, good spokes and rims and hubs and the wheel being put together properly). If you like a good touring bike which comes in 26" for your size but not 700c, then get the 26". Likewise, if you only have the 700c option, get it. This choice should mean good bike fit and decent quality components. So, I think the answer for all of them is pretty much a wash - you can find a good wheel which works in either size for almost everybody. Note that you want big tires for touring, so the air cushions you, but touring frames generally have this built in. 

A longer frame pump is advantageous - a lot of them can be mounted along the length of your top tube and work a lot faster/easier than mini pumps. Mini pumps (and frame pumps in general) always take forever (at least, it feels like forever, though some are better than others due to chamber size and if they can inflate on the push and pull stroke of the pumping action among other design factors) and are tough at higher pressures. You just need to get enough air until you can get to a track pump - In theory and by design, you could probably get to full pressure with a good frame/mini pump but in practice, you may not due to tired-ness and other factors that come with a ride. The amount of time and effort it takes obviously depends on the volume of the tires and pressures you're running as well as how quickly you can pump. If you look at some reviews, you can probably find the highly variable measurement of how long someone took to pump their tire in "pumps". When you use a hand pump like a conventional frame/mini pump, you lose the advantage of weight and upper body muscles you use with a floor (track) pump (aside from the typically smaller volumes) [but you can get this on the go to some extent with a frame-mounted floor pump]. The Lezyne Micro Floor Drive HP-HPG looks interesting as a small frame-mounted floor pump (similar to the Topeak Morph line, but oddly much cheaper and possibly more ergonomic) and according to a review does quite well on the pressure and inflation efficiency front. I don't think a gauge is necessary, but a hose is useful - you avoid transferring your momentum of pumping directly to the valve, which can cause some damage if you do it too much (i.e. not careful). Sheldon has some tips for doing this (my current frame pump does not have a hose, but I do wish it did). If you do get a mini pump though, try to get one with a CO2 inflator built in as well and carry some CO2 cartridges (or at least a mini inflator). Some day you may be too tired or in need of a quick inflate (e.g. in the rain), and this could really help you (though they can't do minor adjustments of a tire pressure like a pump can). Also, try to avoid flats in the first place - kevlar belted tires, proper tire inflation, etc. will save you the agony of having to use your pump. And always have a way to get home otherwise (e.g. bus, calling someone, etc.). 

It looks like you need this one (Wheels Mfg 21, which they list for Giant Boulders of all years). If you took the bike to your bike shop, they'd compare the derailleur hanger visually to other ones used by Giant and see there is nothing else like it. Or pull up a chart from Wheels Mfg and look up what bike it is and which ones could fit. So it looks like the one you have found on eBay is the right one. 

Use a Wolf Tooth RoadLink to mount the derailleur lower and use a bigger cassette Use a slightly smaller front chainring (46t or 48t) Do a cage swap from a long cage mountain derailleur Move to SRAM shifters and derailleurs or a lower speed Shimano group (10 speed?) Use a JTek Shiftmate 8 (or 8A, preferrably) and a Shimano 11 speed mountain derailleur and a bigger cassette Use bar end shifters and a different derailleur Just try SRAM's 11-36 road cassette and see if it works by adjusting the derailleur (linked article claims putting the B-screw down 2/3rds of the way makes it work fine on an Ultegra). 

The only measurement for a bottom bracket you can do with the bottom bracket still on the bike is to do the shell width, which is the width of the frame where the bottom bracket installs. In order to measure the spindle length, you need to remove the cranks and then measure the spindle length. There is no guarantee that the spindle is symmetric or the width of the cranks on both sides is the same. In any case, you'll need to pull off the cranks to replace them. 

Well, your handlebar's diameter where the stem clamps onto it has to be compatible with your stem. Your brake levers and shifters (if any) should also be able to clamp onto the bar (this also means matching diameters). After that, its completely up to personal choice. Go with something that makes you feel comfortable and happy. I do have fairly wide bars on a commuter mountain bike I use -- I find them very helpful in snow. Really narrow handlebars on fixies are primarily fashion (as everything else on fixies are) -- you could have significantly wider bars than the ones you're talking about and still not hit anything more than you would have due to your body width.
