Something like "We're sorry, but the positions are filled at this time. For future openings, please see our jobs site at jobs.yourcompany.com" should suffice. In the future, whenever you need an email address to use for these sorts of time-limited external communications, create one specifically for that purpose that you can forward, or use an email from which you can add/remove yourself. 

It's a waste of time. In your comments, you indicated that you have talked with her about her behavior in the past. Hopefully, your annual reviews of her also reflected your feelings and she hasn't been rewarded for behavior that you consider inappropriate. (Annual reviews are an important time to provide feedback on work and behavior as well as career growth - both good and bad). Hopefully, you tried to coach her up, but unfortunately it didn't sink in. That happens. Not everyone really wants to hear the truth about themselves, particularly when it's not all positive. Either way, unless she herself asks for some constructive feedback, it's too late to do anything about it. Feedback on the way out the door carries far less meaning. And feedback to someone not ready to accept it is just hot air. If she does ask for your feedback, this is your opening to be very honest. Consider having a lunch or coffee offsite and making it clear that you feel she has lots of potential but has one area to work on. And if you get the sense that she isn't hearing what you are saying or becomes defensive, just stop. You'll have done what you can. 

Use this as an opening to ask for some coaching from your manager. The fact that you indicate "with such negativity around me I can not even work" is a sign that you need help now. Explain that you want to learn about more effective leadership, and use the case of this one subordinate who somehow pushes your buttons as a specific example of where you aren't sure what to do. Discuss your plans (such as pulling this individual out of client meetings), and your reasoning. Ask for feedback. This can be a great way to show that you really want to do better, to work more closely with your manager, to be a more effective leader, and to learn how to deal with the 'arrogant subordinates" of the world. 

I've been at one place that had pretty much zero turnover for periods of time. In that case, it was a pretty good shop. There were good people, steady work, competitive pay, and a pleasant environment. The biggest drawback I found was the lack of advancement. Without people leaving, and almost no hiring, few people were promoted. I was young at the time, and at that point in my professional career I needed more career growth than the company could provide, so I left after a few years. I joined a far more rapid-paced company that had more typical turnover. For me, it worked out quite well. 

That's more common. But "normal" depends on the locale, the domain, and of course the specific company. Most shops where I've worked, folks were reasonably free to arrive when they chose and leave when they chose - except that they were expected to be there for "core hours". Those core hours were when the companies hold their meetings, and other tasks where folks' physical presence was optimal. For my teams, I tell them that I don't care when they show up or when they leave. But I do require them to attend all important meetings. And I want them to set a regular schedule that meets their needs, and let me know when they are planning to deviate from their normal schedule. That way, I can plan my work and meetings accordingly, and I don't get worried if they aren't around when expected. That said, it matters little what is "common". The only thing that matters is what is expected at your company. If you are interviewing at a company whose schedule requirements don't meet your needs or preferences, you are free to pass on the job and find one you like better. It certainly makes sense to ask about their scheduling during your interview, if it's something you care about. 

Yes, you would be flip-flopping. Only you can know if this means your manager will start to view you as a high-maintenance type who will never be happy. That's a risk in making repeated requests to move to different teams. 

It's hard to know without seeing all the details. You made the decision to take the "bird in hand" and sign the contract with company B rather than waiting for a decision from company A. And after seemingly changing your mind, you reaffirmed your choice and promised once again to work for them. So it's hard to blame company B here for their admittedly "pretty good" offer. They might have pressured you a bit, but that's just business. Their hiring tactics don't make any difference now anyway, unless they did something provably illegal. You have a choice to make. Other than feeling better about breaking the contract and going back on your word, even if folks agreed "company B is mean" it won't matter. 

No. It's not a good idea. You already stated a desired pay range. They have met that pay range. Now you are indicating you want more than you stated previously, without providing any valid reason why you are worth more. It would be a mistake to think that you have uncovered data that the company's HR doesn't already know. And it would be a mistake to think that you can pinpoint a comparable position on a website better than the company's HR could. They know the specifics of the job far more completely than you do. This makes your argument very weak. HR or the hiring manager can easily come back with other surveys that show how you are wrong and that their offer is more generous than most. You risk coming off as someone who doesn't really know what he wants, and you risk coming off as someone who will never be satisfied. Instead, tell the hiring manager why you are worth more than what you originally asked for, and what additional value you will bring to the company. Think in business terms, not website survey terms. Something like "I'm really excited to come work for you, if we can get together on the compensation. Now that I understand more about the position, I realize that I can deliver more value to the company than I originally thought. Let me tell you how I'll do it." And follow it up with specifics on how you can make a higher salary worth it to them. The more you demonstrate that you understand the company and the job, and the more you show how much value you can add, the more you will impress the hiring manager. It may not work out, but it will give you a far better chance of getting a higher compensation than just saying "because the survey on website X says 90". 

Neither. You should know if a job is full time or part time before you apply. If you want a part-time position, don't apply for a full-time job. If you were applying for a full-time job and you asked at any point before you were hired if you could work part-time, I would drop you as a candidate. I would conclude that you wouldn't be happy in the job I was offering. If I wanted a part-timer, I would mention that in the job ad. In my experience as a hiring manager, that's never been a negotiable feature of a job. As a hiring manger for many years, I always had to create a req for the new position. And I always had to declare if the position was full-time/part-time. It would be odd to go back and change the req ("You know what, I don't really need a full-timer for this position after all"). Unless the business need had somehow changed, that's not something I would do. If you really want a part-time job, apply for jobs listed as part-time. 

This is certainly something you want to discuss with your new boss. While there are attributes that generally make a worker "good" in many contexts, what makes you good to your boss, your company, and ultimately your profession is very context-dependent. In general, I value 

At least in the US, you can request these from your school. There is no need to approach your current employer. Once you request them, and learn how long it will take for them to arrive, notify your hiring manager. He/she will almost certainly understand, as this likely isn't the first time she/he has asked for them. 

It doesn't matter what they usually pay, only what they will pay for you. If you think what they are offering isn't enough, you would be better served to say "I want $Z" and work from there. Be prepared to walk away if they decide you aren't worth that much. 

Both. You should immediately talk to your manager about the project - where you are, when you think you will be done and why, and what you are doing about it. You should also work extremely hard to find a solution as quickly as possible. 

Professionalism? Personal integrity? Commitment to doing your work to the best of your ability perhaps? How you would look to others who may be able to help your career somewhere down the line perhaps? You are going to be gone in 3 weeks anyway, does it matter who will be blamed? And if so, would you rather be blamed for a project not completed on time in spite of your best efforts? Or blamed as someone who didn't even bother to try? 

This might be something you'd want to discuss during a 2nd interview. I know I would. Even if you decide that you don't formally have to accept the blame, wouldn't you want to know the kind of budget pressure you'll be under such that you might be forced to continue using unlicensed software? And one line of thought is that if they are willing to "cut corners" regarding the legality of the software they are using, where else might they follow less-than-ethical standards? Discussing the situation might help you decide if this is the kind of company you would want to work for. 

You simply make it known that you don't want to sign the form as it stands. If asked, you provide the reasons for your concern. 

The key to getting better at anything, or getting past this sort of problem, is practice. You get better at sports by practicing. You get better at typing by practicing. Interviewing is no different - you will get better (and more comfortable) with practice. Start with a trusted friend or family member. Have her/him take the role of interviewer and ask you interview-type questions. You answer, while remaining calm, maintaining good eye contact, etc. When each session is done, ask your friend how you did, what you didn't do well, and what you could do better. Repeat several times until it starts to feel more natural. You could then have your friend find someone you don't know to take on the role of interviewer and practice some more. If you are still in contact with your university, often their placement offices can set you up with someone who can help you practice your interview skills and offer interview coaching as well. Some folks even video-record their practice interview sessions. Playing them back can often be insightful. 

Yes, be concerned, but not worried. Until you have a formal, written and signed offer in hand, you should always be concerned that the job offer may not come through. Even then, until you actually start on the job, things can happen. That said, the only thing you can do is wait for this offer while you continue on with other interviews. Being "concerned" doesn't really help much. Things often takes longer than expected. Just try to be patient. 

It's not crazy, just long odds - perhaps odds that suggest you should also start looking for a job at a new third company. You already rejected their offer and stayed at your company because of the promotion, money and commute. The new company presumably knows that. Now you have to somehow convince them that this time you really know what you want. And that this time you won't accept yet another counter-offer, or an offer from a third company and leave them after a short period. And you have to convince them that their offer is sufficient, even though it may be less in several factors than the counter-offer that you previously accepted. Think this through carefully, and rehearse your answers, since the questions will almost certainly be asked. Make sure your answers are calm and convincing. The new company might feel a bit hurt and rejected. They may have already filled the position. They may conclude that you are indecisive or don't really know what you want. Or they just may have a policy that precludes revisiting prior rejected offers. The worst that can happen is that they say "No" and you move on. Probably worth a try as long as you keep your expectations low. 

Some companies are indeed 'worth more'. Those are the companies that hiring managers often know by name. 

If you were part of my family, or a close friend of mine, I'd tell you to stop replying to such texts and that you are encouraging him. If I knew you better, I could tell if you were doing it on purpose and really want his attention, or just don't know any better. 

It's only been one week since your last interview. Wait at least one more week before following up. If the Y salary is outside their typical salary range, then it takes time to justify the exception internally. Try to be patient. 

Understanding more about what might be behind these moods might allow you to deal with the root cause, and not just the symptoms. Dealing with the cause is often far more effective in the long run. I have found that after certain monthly meetings, I tend to feel a bit deflated and less productive. Knowing this, I try to adjust my schedule so that I can use this down period for research and other routine tasks which don't require the same level of intense concentration. After performing a few hours of more menial tasks, I find that I can shake off the mood and get back to my usual productivity. Occasionally, I'll have a day such as you describe which is very non-productive. Sometimes, I'll get all the really important work done, and then just leave. I find some way to clear my head, sometimes taking a walk, often just doing something other than work that needs my immediate attention. I pick things up either later from home, or just wait until the next day. Fortunately, in my shop I have that flexibility. Overall, what you describe happens to everyone. Don't sweat it. 

First, I'm very sorry to hear about your grandpa. The good thing is that you may be there in time to say a last goodbye. Just be up-front with your employer. Explain what the doctors have said and that it's important to you and your family to be there. Tell your boss that you will stay in touch and (if you want to) work as much as you can remotely. Plan on using whatever personal/vacation days you have available if your bereavement days run out. 

This is a question for your manager/supervisor. You understand the "what" of the job you are performing, but not the "how". In some shops, it's appropriate to sit around and wait 10-20 minutes periodically. In other shops you would be expected to be doing more than one thing and switching between tasks. In my shop, I tend to hire fairly senior folks. Here, if you had frequent idle periods of 10-20 minutes several times each day, the question would be "why aren't you finding a better way to get this task done?" You would be expected to use your experience and intelligence to find ways not to be so idle. In your shop, perhaps you aren't very senior and/or you are expected to do all your work serially and are just expected to wait around. Your mileage may vary. But nobody here can tell you what you are obliged to do - that's something only your boss can determine.
