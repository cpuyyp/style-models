The "Germanization" process really only got underway after the unification of Germany in 1870. That means you have a period of only 40 years in which Germany is actively trying to suppress Polish culture. And in practice it wasn't very thorough. I think you vastly underestimate the opportunity for and existence of "high-level" communication and culture in Polish in the Prussian-controlled territories. For example, the city of Pozn√°n saw the founding (and persistence) of: 

(The downside is that records like these are probably rarer or missing for the 16th and 17th Centuries, so earlier aspects of the slave trade may not be as recoverable.) Gwendolyn Midlo Hall later wrote a book called Slavery and African Ethnicities in the Americas: Restoring the Links, which I suspect might be relevant. (I haven't read it, but it seems to have gotten lots of positive scholarly reviews.) As for "In the rest of the Americas, either Afroamerican religions were completely eradicated, or they are predominantly influenced by Yoruba tradition": 

The retreat of the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph in 1877 is a good candidate: a fighting retreat in good order, covering a distance that is variously described as anything from about 1,150 to 1,500 miles (1850 to 2400 km). (I have seen claims that this was taught to US Army and Marine officers, at least as recently as the Vietnam War era, as an exemplar of a well-conducted fighting retreat.) 

Different European countries operated in different areas of West Africa at different times; There were probably variations in the ethnicity of slaves that were available to European slave traders at different times based on local historical developments. E.g., if Dahomey lost a war, there might be more Fon- and Ewe-speaking slaves for sale from the victors. Some colonies imported slaves directly from Africa, while others did so indirectly (via transshipment points or regional markets in the Caribbean, for example). As you note, colonies sometimes changed hands, which could have some effect on the slave trade. 

It's certainly true that the Soviet Union cultivated friendly relations with India from the accession of Khrushchev onward (Stalin seems to have viewed India as basically an agent of the West, despite its independence), including significant amounts of foreign aid. Khrushchev visited India in 1955, following a visit to the Soviet Union by Nehru earlier that year, and announced Soviet support for Indian sovereignty over the disputed territory of Kashmir and the still-Portuguese enclave of Goa. The Soviet Union also maintained a pose of neutrality during the Sino-Indian border dispute of 1959 and the Sino-Indian War in 1962, despite their alliance with China. Soviet-Indian relations continued to improve after the Sino-Soviet break in the mid-1960s, since India considered China its main threat and the Soviet Union was now antagonistic toward China (the Sino-American rapprochement in the early 1970s no doubt furthered this). From what I can, however, large-scale Indian purchases of Soviet weaponry didn't really begin until the mid-1960s (after the time of Nehru); prior to that, their weapons were primarily British and French. The change came from a desire to modernize and expand the Indian military, particularly following the defeat of the Sino-Indian War. This came at the same time as a period of economic hardship and a shortage of hard currency, which made it difficult to buy Western arms. (A US/British arms embargo against both India and Pakistan during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War didn't help, either.) The Soviets offered to sell India weapons in exchange for rupees, with generous credit and finance options (e.g., a seven-year grace period before the beginning of actual payment, followed by a 17-year payment period with only 2.5% interest). They were also willing to negotiate the licensed production of Soviet weapons in India, allowing some technology transfer; some Indian defense officials hoped this would help India develop its own arms industry. (India did acquire some Western arms via similar licensing deals.) The fact that Soviet weapons were almost always cheaper than Western equivalents, even without the generous credit and financing arrangements, probably helped as well. (My understanding is that the Indian military remained biased towards British and other Western weapons for some time; e.g., the Indian Air Force preferred the US-made F-104 over the Soviet MiG-21 in the 1960s, but was overridden by the Defence Ministry on the basis of economics and the prospect of technology transfer.) 

In general, English speakers in the 18th Century would have used the second of your two meanings; it's the older one, and derives from Latin colonia, which referred to the Roman (and earlier Greek, and also Phoenician) practice of planting settlements in foreign places. Most of what were counted as "colonies" in the 18th Century were colonies in the "settlement of our people in foreign lands" sense. What I suspect happened is that as Britain began acquiring other country's "colonies" by force or by treaty (e.g., Jamaica from the Spanish, Dutch colonies like New Amsterdam, French colonies like Quebec), they were folded into the general concept of "colony" -- and administered by the same parts of the government. E.g., after the French and Indian War, Quebec was now ruled by Britain. Although it was of course a French colony and not a British one, it was still a "colony", it was in North American along with the other British-founded colonies, and so it became one of the "colonies". Following the loss of the thirteen American colonies, the balance of "overseas realms controlled by Britain" shifted more and more towards "conquered/occupied foreign realms", and so the meaning of "colony" shifted toward the first one in your list. (Helped, perhaps, by the tendency of some British people to go out and settle in some of those places.) 

I suspect it may be possible to derive more information about this, but in many cases the records have not been investigated properly. A couple of decades ago, a researcher (Gwendolyn Midlo Hall) looking into 18th and 19th Century records in Lousiana discovered extensive notes about the particular ethnic origins of slaves, which the local archivists were unaware of: $URL$ . A relevant quote: 

This probably isn't the sort of answer you were really looking for, but you might take a look at the 1991 Canadian movie Black Robe, which takes place in 1630s Quebec in the context of Jesuit missions to the Hurons and was praised for its attempts at historical authenticity (especially for the different Indian groups, but also for early New France). 

It makes sense that colonies belonging to different European nations would preferentially buy from traders of the same nation, since under the prevailing mercantilist legal regimes the latter would automatically (or most easily) have the right to trade with said colonies. (And would know the language, which helps.) And, of course, it also makes sense that when colonists moved and took their slaves with them, or sold their slaves, it would be more likely for the destination to be another colony of the same mother country. The problem in trying to make a simple conclusion like "traders from European country X always bought slaves of ethnic group Y from locale Z" is that: 

I do know of cases where individual warships built in the 1920s and 1930s with rather vertical bows were refitted with more forward-slanting "Atlantic bows" because they shipped too much water over the bow in their trials (e.g., the two ships of the German Scharnhorst class), which supports what the Wikipedia article says. Possibly the trend towards faster and faster warships in the early 20th Century (typical battleship top speeds going from less than 20 knots at the beginning of the century to around 30 knots in the 1930s) contributed to this. The same Wikipedia page includes some other examples of modern inverted bows, in addition to the Zumwalt class.
