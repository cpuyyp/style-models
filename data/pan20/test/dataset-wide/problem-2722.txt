The question is whether the observed reliability of the content of our cognitive faculties is likely to be true given a belief that this content is only the result of some neural process of the brain, in other words, given a belief in semantic epiphenomenalism which would justify determinism. If one can show that the content of our cognitive faculties are more likely true than they should be assuming semantic epiphenomenalism that would provide empirical evidence against such epiphenomenalism. Here are the specific questions: 

As reference I will use Stephen Mumford & Rani Lill Anjum’s “Causation: A Very Short Introduction”. Although they do not discuss causality without time, their survey provides insight that should be useful in viewing causality atemporally such as through the creative contemplation of Plotinus. These authors start with Hume’s analysis or reduction of causation into three simpler ideas: (1) repeatability, (2) cause comes before effect, and (3) constant conjunction. Kant criticizes the second, claiming that causation happens simultaneously, however, this still leaves causation within time. Others use necessity or a transfer process or some other method to analyze causation differently, but all of them miss some aspects of what is intuitively meant by cause. The authors provide counterexamples for all of these theories. More recently people tried to combine the various reductionistic causation theories into a pluralist setting, but that simply emphasized the failure of analysis to reduce causation to something simpler. Finally the authors presented the idea that causation is a primitive concept. It cannot be analyzed into simpler components. The components used by other theories to reduce it to something non-cause-like are seen by the primitivist theory called dispositionalism to be only symptoms that a cause is present. With dispositionalism singular objects have real dispositional properties or causal powers. Dispositionalism is an old idea going back at least to Aristotle. Hume was reacting to this tradition when he tried to analyze causation without admitting the existence of causal powers. Dispositionalism provides a justification that lets us see causation as a primitive idea. It also points back to ancient philosophy which may provide a link to someone like Plotinus who had the idea of creative contemplation that is active or causal but also atemporal. In this way one might be able to construct an atemporal theory of causation. 

Humanity (= rational morality) is not merely valuable, according to Kant. It is the sole source of value. Consequently it infuses absolute value in the person who carries it. I don't have a direct evidence that Kant meant the following analogy. But this idea of Kant's seems to me similar to the biblical prohibition to kill a human being "because he was made in the image of God". 

Actually, chapter VIII of Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind (EPM), and section 35 in particular, do not contain any arguments against the Given, certainly not the main argument. The role of chapter VIII (whose title is "Does Empirical Knowledge Have a Foundation?") to present the typical account of empirical knowledge that is associated with the Given, and then to suggest an alternative. The chapter just presents one account beside another. It does not argue against the account of the Given. 

All logical contradictions are based on self contradictions. A self contradiction occurs when there is a statement p such that both p and not p hold. 

That existence is a kind of quality, and moreover a kind of perfection. Since God is the most perfect, he must possess existence, which is one of the perfections. That everything that is thinkable is possessing a sort of existence (*) just by being thought about. So God exists, firstly, simply because we can think about him. And, secondly, since God is thought about as the most perfect being, he must possess normal existence (**) too, because normal existence is a perfection (4). 

One can say more about libertarian free will given John Conway and Simon Kochen’s “The Free Will Theorem”. This theorem shows that if we have free will so does an entangled system of quantum particles. Since libertarianism assumes that we have free will we can conclude so do these quantum particles. Hence free will needs no more than what these quantum particles have. It does not require a brain. It does not require a program. It does not require moral realism nor moral anti-realism justifying praise or blame. 

There is no point at infinity. The only available points are represented as real numbers. The infinity symbol, that figure-8 on its side, represents unboundedness, not a particular point. One can talk about the limit being unbounded or infinite, but the limit never reaches that particular unbounded value. That is why limits are used rather than specifying a point to represent infinity. 

In Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” he writes in 6(9) The Argument from Extrasensory Perception that 

The scientific method should provide a way to solve the demarcation problem that CriglCragle pointed out in his comment. That is, it should be a way to distinguish what a real scientist does from a “pseudoscientist” or someone not doing science. Consider what is listed in the definition obtained from the search. We have that a scientist does the following: 

To stress the point a bit: the principle of charity in interpretation, despite its nickname, is not a matter of charity. It is not a matter of generosity, or of good will. It is not, that is, optional, but necessary. If you are not invoking it, towards opinions that you hear, and towards texts that you read, you are practically guaranteed to misunderstand what you hear and read. 

So that Russell saw Wittgenstein's inclusion of remarks about solipsism in the Tractatus curious. This could suggest that these remarks were indeed rooted, at least in part, in some residual fascination of Wittgenstein's with Schopenhauer. 

Kantian intuitions, as I understand them, are basically just changing kaleidoscopic images. That is, heaps of sensible qualities, like colors, stretched over space and time. . To say that Kantian intuitions are "non conceptual" seems to me ambiguous. The Kantian intuitions do not involve "the concepts of the Understanding", especially the concepts of enduring substances and of causes and effects. But Kantian intuitions can and do involve other kinds of concepts: concepts of space and time, which Kant identified with mathematical concepts (arithmetical and geometrical); qualitative concepts: colors, sounds, smells etc; concepts of strength and intensity. Kantian intuitions are conscious, at least in potential. Nothing is hidden in them. As to being "objective", this is again ambiguous. Anything that can be thought about Kant calls an "object", including subjective phenomena and unknowable things. The word "objective" he usually reserves for the sensible (material) world, and for the possibility of knowing it. So intuitions can represent objects without being objective; as they do in dreams. It is instructive, in the present regard, to compare the Kantian intuitions, that is sense experience, to that of the classical empiricists (Locke, Berkeley, Hume). The empiricists conceived of sense experience as consisting of bundles of sensible qualities, such as colors and shapes. All our concepts were, according to the empiricists, subsequently derived from the encounters with these bundles. Kant added over these encounters with bundles of qualities that (1) time and space are not derived from sense experience, but are its apriori forms; and that (2) the concepts of the Understanding, concepts of enduring substances, and of causes and effects, also have an apriori basis, and so are not derived from sense experience. There could be an experience of objects which does not abide by the concepts and rules of the Understanding (in this sense, the Understanding is not like space and time). But there could not be an objective experience, i.e. an experience that can lead to knowledge of an objective world, which does not abide by the concepts and rules of the Understanding. And this makes those concepts apriori valid. 

So, after showing the universe had a beginning and did not create itself, al-Kindi needed to show how God could create the universe from nothing. He used Plotinus’s True One as his view of God. This was in accord with the views of the Mu‘tazilites although it involved a “rigorous determinism”. Craig preferred a different argument provided by al-Ghazali that viewed God as a personal agent. 

Whitehead in Science and the Modern World compared what happened to Galileo with religious conflicts at that time. $URL$ 

The room is only a way to isolate the human from outside influence. It is not the computer. There is nothing for the room to learn. The human needs to learn or understand Chinese by running the program. Running the program is what counts not which computer is used to run the program. The program can be moved around to different computers or different humans and the results should be the same. The question is does running the program anywhere generate not only a correct result, but also understanding of Chinese? If it does, then this would be an alternate way for someone to learn a new language. Reference: John Searle, "Minds, Brains and Programs" 

Kant seems to have held that space cannot be a real thing in-itself. First, Kant's conception of space is analogous to the long-held view that colors, smells and such are subjective, "phenomenal", and do not exist independently of us (in modern philosophy, this view is often attributed to John Locke). Kant thought of space, then, in the same way that a physicist thinks of colors. To think that space really existed would be analogous to thinking that colors existed physically, in addition to particles, waves and such. 

Concerning the Gods, they have been doing a lot of mischief in the Greek mythology. Socrates and Plato, however, considered this preposterous. The Gods, by them, had to be virtuous. In the Republic, Plato's programme for an ideal state includes related censorship of Homer and other poets over this issue. 

Part of the answer, I think, lies in distinguishing between Aristotle himself and later-day Aristotelians. During the philosophical and scientific revolution in the 17th century, many Aristotelian doctrines were criticized and refuted. The defenders of Aristotelian views were criticized and ridiculed. This was not so much against Aristotle himself, as against the apparent stagnant dogmatism of those who adhered religiously to the letter of Aristotle, two thousand years after his time, and became blind to every innovation and progress. For example Descartes, in the Discourse on Method, pays respect to ancient philosophers, and to Aristotle in particular... 

The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN) is an argument against naturalism not atheism in general nor any specific evolution theory. Evolution viewed theistically includes the add-on that evolution is guided. Evolution viewed naturalistically includes the add-on that evolution is unguided. Plantinga needs to describe naturalism in such a way that when combined with evolution it leads to unreliability of cognitive functions. This requires describing the way belief relates to behavior given naturalism or describing the materialistic view of human beings given naturalism. According to the Wikipedia article Plantinga reformulated the argument in 2008 that originally appeared in 1993 in Warrant and Proper Function. In 1994 he published a version in “Naturalism Defeated” (ND) that is available online. The current version is in Where the Conflict Really Lies (WTCRL). Premise 1, or “Darwin’s doubt”, states the following taken from WTCRL, page 316: 

What believers of a religion follow is the reality referenced by their scripture, not the scripture itself. The scripture keeps that reality in the believer’s mind, but it is not that reality. If the text were what was followed, the text would be a kind of idol. Accepting the scripture or an interpretation of a scripture is something a believer chooses to do or not do after the believer understands the scripture. If the reality referenced by the scripture is infinite and the text is finite, the mapping between the finite text and infinite reality cannot be expected to represent a bijection. See the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's Maimonides reference for a suggestion that silence may be a better interpretation of the content of some scriptures. This would also be true for sentences dependent upon human understanding, not only scriptures that a believer uses. By contrast, if a text were codified so transformations of the text could be checked by a computer, an “interpretation” of that text could be defined as any valid transformation. Then acceptance or "following" of the original text or an interpretation would be based on the computer's logic, not human understanding. That, however, is not what is going on with human understanding of a scripture. 

Concerning the other question, I'm not aware that anyone argued that the Tractatus implies that the world of facts cannot also be spoken about. Many have suggested the opposite, i.e. that the Tractatus itself shows that more can be spoken about than is supposed. Thus Bertrand Russell, in his Introduction to the Tractatus: 

I think there is no philosophical or logical sense in which two things are simply similar. Instead, things are similar, or not, in some respect, or in some regard. For example, A yellow cube is similar to a yellow sphere with regard to color, but dissimilar with regard to shape. Two logically valid arguments may be similar in various ways: in regard to logical form (e.g. modus ponens), in being sound (having true premises), in having negative premises, in having the same number of premises, etc. 

Despite research that was done, and the availability of the Wittgenstein-Sraffa correspondence, there seems to be no evidence for a specific philosophical influence on Sraffa on Wittgenstein. The short essay "Sraffa’s Impact on Wittgenstein" (Matthias Unterhuber, 2013) summarizes the currently available evidence on the subject. The most famous story regarding Sraffa and Wittgenstein, concerning a certain gesture made by Sraffa, while riding on a train with Wittgenstein, was told by Norman Malcolm: 

If the multiverse leads to science losing its predictive power, it is not likely a good ground for scientific law. 

Consider how you have learned other things in the past. When you start learning something you search for a frame of reference. You go to the library or you do an internet search. You might want to absorb everything you find, somehow, like a computer dumping all the text available onto its hard-drive without understanding, but what you really want is understanding, not just text. However, it is physically impossible to absorb everything that is available. So, you must make a choice between the available alternatives, but which one? You start with one book, even one chapter, perhaps even one web page. Once you have read that one you start understanding. You realize you don’t need to read everything, nor read all of anything, that is available. Soon your interest points you to a different source. That different source leads to another. That source may lead you back to the first one which you realize you did not really understand the first time you read it. You read it again and perhaps you even read more of it. As long as you are motivated to continue, your understanding improves. If this is how we learn, then consider the question: 

This is somewhat speculative, but (2) seems to be just lying (to the authorities), while (1) is submitting a false piece of physical evidence or a false document. The associated claim may actually be true, e.g. you really do have a PhD, but you present a false PhD diploma. This would make you guilty of (1) but not of (2). While if you just lie, without presenting physical evidence or documents, you will be guilty of (2) but not of (1). 

The question, whether an absence can be a cause, is a profound one. However, I believe it is not really related to the epistemological question at hand. The paragraph that you quoted is confused about that. The problem in using the term luck in a definition of knowledge is not related to being, to absence, or to causation. The real problem in clarifying knowledge by luck is that (1) the concept of luck is itself unclear; and in particular (2) it is doubtful whether the concept of luck could be clarified without invoking the concept of knowledge. So that if we attempt to clarify the concept of knowledge by the concept of luck, we will be moving in a vacuous circle. Consider a person A looking at a clock that is showing the hour 8 am, and judging upon that the hour is 8 am. Suppose also (1) that the hour is indeed 8 am, but (2) that the clock is really defective, and (3) that a person B intentionally set the clock to 8 am, unknown to person A. Now A's judgement that the hour is 8 am is a justified true belief; yet it does not seem to be an instance of knowledge. But it is also does not seem to be a matter of luck. After all B intentionally rigged the clock, so it's not luck. Or is it?..
