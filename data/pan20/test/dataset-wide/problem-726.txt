I ride pretty aggressively cross country and trail in colorado, and occasionally will go to the bike park and do some jumps. I recently bought a specialized hardrock 29er for my wife, who's a novice rider. The price was right, and the bike is great for her. The problem is I want to ride it sometimes, but the fork sketches me out. First: it sucks compared to my fox fork on my 26" bike and second: I'm afraid it's going to break on me. The fork is an 80mm SR suntour. Does anybody have any suggestions for reasonably priced replacements? I don't want to change the geometry too much. I think the idea is if i put some money into the fork, we could put it on her next bike if/when she decides to upgrade. 

I had this trouble, and after checking the usual suspects (Replaced chain, cassette, cables, housing, and derailleur), it turned out my frame was failing near the bottom bracket. Although it's the most expensive to fix: before you start replacing components, do a quick visual inspection of the frame. Look for cracks/separations around the rear triangle. This is a rare problem, but could be the most serious. If you determine your frame is fine: 

The large chainring on my mountain bike is missing a number of teeth on one side (apparently the side I like to go over rocks on). Is it harmful to the drivetrain to ride without these if I'm not having issues loosing the chain? At what point should i replace the chain ring? 

Normally if everything is going right: you shouldn't have this problem. I was having this problem: The bike shifted great on the stand but performed horribly under load. The solution was the frame was failing near the bottom bracket, causing the frame to flex when I was pedaling. I've also seen posts where a rear hub failure was the culprit. 

I've spent hours with my bike on the stand. On the stand: it performs great. When I ride, I can cause the rear gears to shift just by changing how hard I pedal (the harder i pedal, the higher up on the cassette the chain will jump. If i let up, the chain will drop into a harder gear) I've replaced almost everything: Cables/Housing Cassette and Chain, even the rear deraillure hanger and deraillure. Any ideas would be helpful. 

Make sure your drivetrain is in good shape (not overly worn) Your cables move with ease and don't need replaced Your derailleur hanger is straight. your cassette is tight 

In almost every slope you will hit a speed "sweet spot" where the gravity pull and drag from the wind will cancel each other out, this can be at 70 km/h for a 8% slope in aero position or 15 km/h for a 2% slope on an hybrid bike. 

Strava has the option of using "Popularity" to create a route. This means that if more people use Route 2, it should make you go that way. The problem if that if a lot of people are training using Route 1 it might skew the resulting route the other way. Usually I start by checking where other people are going by when I plan my trips, then I can do adjustments based on riding it or by talking to the locals. There is also the option of manually creating the route using Strava or RideWithGPS or other mapping sites, but that would mean that you have previously know which one is the best. 

I think you are confused between tubular and tubeless. Tubular tires are "all in one" tire where the inner tube is sewed inside the tire. Tubeless tires look like regular clincher tire and hooks in specially designed rims; these tubeless tire and rim provide an airtight seal so they can be inflated without an inner tube. Regular clincher tires are very similar, but require an inner tube to contain the air. So a tubeless tire does require a hooked rim, but they are not tubular tires. Additional detail : clincher tires can be installed in tubeless rims with no problems. 

One option would be to use PlastiDip or something similar. It's not paint it's some kind of rubber coating, but I hear that it's really easy to spray on, gives a good finish (with a few applications) and doesn't require a lot of preparation (no sanding, it's removed easily if you spray at the wrong place). A lot of people use these products for car parts. 

So you might check those dedicated lanes. An other option would be to use Strava's Global Heatmap where you can see where people are cycling the most. You can't really see what you want exactly (dedicated lanes), but coupled with Google's map, I find it's a good start to plan a ride. 

The big thing is : you have a very subjective human riding the bicycle. Even if a study shows that for X leg length you need Y crank length, if the person riding the bike think that Z cranks feel better or feel faster, what can you do? That is mostly why there is so much debate, because everybody is different. Also people want different things from their bike, some want minimum maintenance, while other want minimum friction. Some people want light wheels, other want stiffer wheels. Some people don't mind lubing the chain after each ride, while other will do it one a season. 

I've ridden commuter and road racing bikes both for decades and can validate your decision to go specific in regards to your shoe/pedal setup. Start with the shoes - try a bunch on and find a pair that really fit well and seem to work for you. Most modern shoe/pedal systems use the three bolt pattern common to Shimano and Look systems so there's not a lot of compatibility issues anymore. Speedplay is the outlier for sure here - I wouldn't worry so much about single sided vs double sided. Getting in and out is a bit trickier for road systems but you'll figure it out quickly regardless. What you want to concentrate on is float and release pressure. Since you're used to clipless on your commuter, it will be fairly straightforward to try systems out. Work with a retailer who will let you try different systems while using a trainer, that way you can get a feeling for how they work. If you don't have a retailer close by who will let you do this, look for a fitter and ask them to fit you. It costs about $100-$150 to get fitted properly with new shoes and pedals on your bike but it's well worth it in the long run. 

I think the maintenance periods for MTB are the hardest to predict, because conditions vary greatly. If you ride in wet, muddy conditions you'll have to replace your drivetrain and brake components far more frequently than if you ride mostly in dry conditions. You seem to be mostly concerned about bearing systems so I'm guessing you're riding in the slop a lot.. I'd plan on rebuilding the suspension after every season (or 6 months of solid riding), replace the disc brake pads and probably drivetrain components on the same schedule, but test this assumption - use a chain wear indicator and calipers to measure chain and brake pad wear respectively. I wouldn't worry so much about wheel bearings, derailleur and frame pivots - they'll let you know when they're shot.. 

Did you yourself grease the threads before installing? This is especially important when the lock ring is aluminum. I'll assume your free hub body is either steel or titanium and there's no grease. If force alone won't move it, it's time to try leverage or impact or both. In the shop they'll ask you the above question before putting the wheel on the ground with the right (or cassette holding) chain whip in a position where it cannot move (under a table or something solid and heavy). The lock ring tool or wrench can have a longer lever attached to it and push straight down. If that doesn't work, get a plastic hammer and try impact. Good luck, and always grease your threads.. 

I fear that you won't be able to replace the wheel with exactly the same thing since they seem to be generic wheels built for this bike. You can try the dealer you bought them from, they might have a replacement available or you can look for a different set elsewhere. In that price category you might have to buy a set (front+rear wheel) thought, but at least that means they will match. 

It's a little more than 100$, but you could have a Garmin Edge 20 for 130$. Maybe wait a little for a special or something*. According to the post it's a good little computer and I personnaly enjoy using their Edge lineup. (* the website has a 10% anything coupon with their partner, might be worth a look, that would bring the Edge 20 to 117$, might not work for everything thought) 

Google Maps has a Bicycling overlay that can help you. It does have a few indication that states what type of road you have : 

One thing that can help is training on rollers. It's kind of dangerous at the begining, because the bike reacts a lot to little imbalances, but as you get more experience on them you will feel much more stable on the bike and this might help in feeling the bike better on the road. As for bike handling, ride it and ride it more, I don't think anything beats experience. You can look up techniques for cornering or decending, but you will have to try them a little faster each time to know your limit. 

I really enjoy gummy type food (e.g. PowerBar Gel Blast or Cliff Blocks). They have multiple flavors and taste OK. It won't replace a full meal, but it does keep me fueled up for longer rides. These gummies usually have an expiry of +1 year and can take the sun and heat without melting. Some of my packets did a 6h ride in full sun in my back pocket without melting and still being eatable. 

One big difference is where the force is applied. In a conventional pedal, you press down using the ball of you foot. In a foot-long pedal you would have to center the axle so the pedal stays level, but that would mean that the force would be applied by the middle of your foot. You would be losing the power and flexibility that your ankle can bring. Being clipped in the pedal also has many power and security advantages. Does your footlong pedal in your scenario has a way of being clipped ? In that case you still need strong shoes with a sole, so why have that big of a pedal when you can have a single smaller point of contact ?
