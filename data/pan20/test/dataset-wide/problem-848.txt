If you've moved to an area with major aircraft traffic, you may be seeing fewer stars due to cirrus cloud formation. Such clouds are often subtle enough not to be visible as clouds but still block out starlight. For example: Forecasting Andean rainfall and crop yield from the influence of El Niño on Pleiades visibility 

HD 219134b is apparently closest "super earth"; 21 light years away. New Horizons, our speediest yet, is currently running at about 15 km/sec relative to the sun. At 9.46e12 km/lightyear HD 219134b is 2e14 km away At 3.16e7 seconds per year, New Horizons will travel about 4.74e8 km/year. 2e14/4.74e8 = 422000 years. HD 219134b isn't even a very good earth; gravity is too high. 

Gamma ray bursts are thought to emerge from the poles of supernova, so a star's spin axis would have to be in the right direction for it to hit us. Betelgeuse, a nearby supernova candidate has it's spin axis at an inclination of about 20° to the direction of Earth, so that star is not likely to get us when she blows. However, we don't have accurate information on the direction of the spin axis of most stars. 

In reality, both the extent of refraction of the sun's disk and the refraction of the apparent horizon come into play. Both depend on the atmosphere's density and temperature profile; which changes irregularly. That makes it impossible to predict exact sunrise or sunset times when there is an atmosphere. 

But again, this bound should be the upper limit on the entropy of a given region, not necessarily the actual entropy in that region, so this type of holographic bound shouldn't imply that when we increase the entropy of the universe, the universe needs to grow. This paper specifically discusses how most matter-containing regions in cosmology apart from black holes would fail to "saturate" the covariant entropy bound, meaning that the actual entropy in the region is smaller than the maximum possible according to the bound. 

Imagine you have a solar collector measuring one square meter, which can directly measure the power (energy per unit time) striking it. If there are layers of atmosphere above the collector, some of the incoming light is absorbed or reflected by particles in the atmosphere, so you won't measure as much power as if you place the collector in space at the distance of Earth's orbit, with no atmosphere between you and the Sun. But if you place the collector in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the density of atmospheric particles above you is so small that they absorb/reflect only a negligible amount of power. Orientation is also an issue--you'll get the maximum power if you orient the plane of the collector so that it's perpendicular to the direction of the incoming rays. If it's not perpendicular, then if you approximate the incoming radiation as a set of parallel rays which each carry an equal amount of power (a standard approximation in optics) then fewer rays strike the collector when it's at some angle that's not perpendicular to the rays. All this is illustrated in the following diagram (from this page), with the two possible orientations of the solar collector illustrated in gray, and the light rays illustrated as black lines:

I've been reading phys.org for years. It's right up there with physics.aps and physicsworld. All good sources that provide decent refs. Comments are often where people who like to argue, argue. Sometimes they are useful, often not. 

According to this table, Hubble is good down to around magnitude 31.5. What with digital stacking of exposures, that number has got to reflect a point at which detector noise is equal to incoming signal. At the distance of M31, 778000pc, that brightness corresponds to an absolute magnitude of M = 31.5 -5((log778000)-1) = 7. That's about as bright as Epsilon Indus, a K3 class star, 0.45 to 0.8 times the mass of the Sun. If Hubble is seeing that deep, it's a little surprising how few stars it picked up in that image of our neighboring galaxy.

NASA, 2006 implies the limit for radar echoes is at the moons of Saturn: 

So apparently the "covariant entropy bound" (also known as Bousso's holographic bound) is the thing to look into when considering the maximum entropy of the universe (and I assume you just mean the observable universe here rather than whatever may lie beyond it). This set of lecture slides by Raphael Bousso, the physicist who originally proposed the covariant entropy bound, says that this bound is "conjectured to hold in arbitrary spacetimes, including cosmology." But it also says "If correct, origin must lie in quantum gravity", probably meaning one can't derive this fact in a non-conjectural way from basic laws of physics without having a complete theory of quantum gravity. For an introduction to this stuff, I recommend this Scientific American article that discusses various holographic bonds, including the Bekenstein bound along with Bousso's conjectured more general bound (the article was written by Bekenstein himself). Though it is from 2003 so I'm not sure what kind of theoretical progress has been made since then. Anyway, here's what it says about Buosso's entropy bound: 

Holographic entropy bounds are upper bounds for the maximum amount of entropy a given region can have, rather than its current entropy--for example, the spherical region of space just large enough to enclose the Earth and its atmosphere would currently contain a much lower entropy than a spherical black hole of the same radius, whose entropy is given by the Bekenstein bound. The scholarpedia article on the Bekenstein bound mentions the issue of cosmological entropy bounds: 

To see the milky way, you need merely go out at night somewhere where there is a dark, clear sky. In northern hemisphere fall and winter, you'll also be able to see the nearest large galaxy, M31. The large and small Magellanic clouds, visibly grace southern skies. If you live in a city, a cloudy, hazy or very humid region, you're out of luck, unless you can get out into unspoiled countryside. Modern digital cameras are far more sensitive than the human eye.

Technically, yes, the moon does have an atmosphere that gets ionized by the sun. NASA: Is There an Atmosphere on the Moon? 

Although sources go way back, the current best estimate seems to be that of Abdul Ahad from March 2004: 

Earth has orbited the galaxy 16 or more times since the planet formed. Given that even stars in a single open cluster usually have somewhat different velocities relative to galactic center, it's highly doubtful that we can see stars made from the exact same starting material as earth. As for the supernova that delivered the compression wave to our stellar nursery, it's likely too dim by now to be seen for more a few dozen parsecs, and might be located nearly anywhere. 

It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

Even vacuum is seething with virtual particle pairs, so photons always interact with something. Check Wikipedia on the Scharnhorst effect for a bit of an explanation: 

Salem is at 42.5° north. At the equator, the position of the sun varies by 23.5 degrees on either side of the vertical over the course of each year, due to earth's 23.5° axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic. Saturn, however is not on the ecliptic. It departs by about 2.5° over the course of its 29.45 year, 9.5 AU orbit. So once every 29.5 years Saturn's angle to the ecliptic will add 2.5° to the max latitude the planet can be seen overhead. That adds up to 26° as the max latitude Saturn can be seen directly overhead. There's one more factor to account for though. Earth being 1AU out from the sun, it's only 8.5 AU from Saturn at close approach. That will add another 0.2° (by trig) to the max latitude at that time of year when earth is nearest Saturn. That gets us to the possiblity of Saturn appearing directly overhead at up to latitude 26.2°: Miami, Jaipur, or Dubai, not Salem 

There is NASA/JPL's Solar System Simulator. It doesn't cover all points, but does include many of the interesting ones. 

That is also the only point on Earth where an observer on the surface would see the Sun "directly overhead", at the very top of the apparent dome of the sky. So even if you stripped away the Earth's atmosphere, only at this point on the Earth would the power reaching a square meter of the surface be equal to the solar constant, the average power per square meter over the entire illuminated half of the Earth's surface would be less than the solar constant since most of the surface is at an angle relative to incoming rays. Incidentally, the angle of the surface relative to incoming rays is also the main reason why at Northern latitudes, it's warmer in the summer (when the surface at a Northern latitude is closer to being perpendicular to oncoming rays) than in the winter (when the surface is at a more inclined angle relative to incoming rays), as illustrated in a diagram from this page: 

The solar constant is defined to be the power you get on such a surface of unit area if it's not being obstructed by atmospheric particles, and if it's oriented perpendicular to incoming rays so that it receives the maximum possible power at that location. One aspect of the orientation issue that's important to understand is that if you orient your solar collector so that it's parallel to the ground (so that it would be lying flat if it was actually at ground level), then it will only receive the maximum power if the surface of the Earth is itself perpendicular to incoming rays from the Sun at that point, which is not true in the above diagram. It would only be true at the point on Earth that's the dead "center" of the Earth as seen by an observer looking at it from the Sun's position, or the point where the gray line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun intersects with surface of the Earth on this diagram:
