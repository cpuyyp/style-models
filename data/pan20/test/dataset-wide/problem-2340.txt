Recently my girlfriend and I were invited to go camping with our friends at a cabin in Flagstaff, Arizona. My buddies have already left and we're supposed to leave tomorrow to go and meet them up there. Everything has worked out great so far... except for one thing.... I want to bring my dog. Now I'm sure your wondering what the issue is, and well my friends have already left and took their dog with them. Now both theirs and mine know each other very well for they have played together during SEVERAL bbq's, so thats not going to be a problem. The problem we are currently facing is apparently if my dog goes, according to my girlfriend, that my friends will have to tie up their dog while ours is there where as if I just leave her home their dog can "run free" so to speak. Now I can honnestly see their point in the sense of the two dogs playing and getting carried away and taking off twoard another cabin. But outside of that? I don't personally see a problem and I seriously doubt they would do it, but you never know... This is the first time I have gone camping in YEARS and its most certanally the first time since I've had my dog... I don't think its fair to just leave her home like my girl seems to think so.... We do live in an apartment where she doesn't get out as much as she should, but she DOES get out. We can't take her to the dog park because of her breed, despite the fact she is friendly. She gets to go for walks and about once a week to once every two weeks she gets to go and run free on a 2 acre property until lays down in a heap of happy tails and belly rubs. She does really well as far as listening goes when on this property, but thorw in another dog and she doesnkt listen as well as she should, to be honnest sometimes I have to call her multiple times. sometimes I don't. just depends. So please, I'm asking for your advice, should I bring her or should I leave her? My Dog: Breed: Pitbull Boxer Mix Age: 3 Years. Sex: Female Personality: Loving, Sweet Adhd Hyper, protective will probably run circles around the cabin for at LEAST 30 minuets when we get there. Their Dog: Breed: Brindle lab mix Age: 4 years? Sex: Male Personality: Loving, sweet, protective, at times adhd hyper and will probably run circles around the cabin with my dog once/if she gets there. How many people total there: 4 adults. 3 kids (6, 7, and 9) and 1 dog for sure. How many days: For my friends: a week For us: Two Nights and two and a quarter days. EDIT: I would just like to add that if we leave the dog, the dog will NOT be neglected. I have a cat as well who needs to be fed and given attention to. We have someone who is going to be stopping by the house to spend time with the cat/make it seem like someone is home. The main reasons why my girl does not want to take the dog are because we recently have gotten knew neighbors within the last week, we're pretty sure the people beside us do drugs and we don't want to risk our things stolen and in her mind the dog would scare intruders away (yes i have pointed out that if they REALLY want in, they could kill or harm her) and the last reason, she doesn't want to have to worry about said dog doing something she's not supposed to. I'm confident in her, but my fiance is not with another dog around. I need to know opinions soon, we're leaving tomorrow (8-26-14) evening. 

I normally baton with a large knife, but the principle remains the same (driving a wedge to split the wood). I taught myself how to baton in order to quickly make kindling from larger sections, often quarter-rounds, while my little cousin was around. Batoning can be performed on logs or thickers sticks, depending on your needs and the size of your wedge. I often find myself hacking up sections of fallen branches before batoning them into usable kindling. 

I've been researching tents to replace some low-quality dome tents that each have had a partial rainfly. Every tent I've owned that has had a partial rainfly has performed horribly in the rain (I pitched them correctly and used guylines when available). I have a tent that has a full-coverage rainfly and has performed quite well. What are the pros and cons of a full-coverage rainfly? I'm mostly interested in three-season responses aimed at temperate and subalpine climates, but wouldn't mind four-season/winter responses, as well as other climates. Disclaimer: The images linked were chosen arbitrarily to illustrate my description. I have no affiliation with the tents or brands pictured. 

Select your wedge (axe), baton (a piece of wood or plastic that fits comfortably in your hand), location (harder ground or rock, but not concrete, as it can crack), and wood (firewood, branch, etc). Position your wood and wedge. Where your wedge's blade goes will depend on what you're splitting. You may be able to go straight through the center of a small-ish branch (like this). In the case of logs, I tend to remove lengthwise corner sections (like this). Once you've positioned the wood, wedge, and have your baton in hand, begin batoning. To baton, treat the action like you're hammering a nail. Swinging too lightly won't get you anywhere, while swinging too hard initially may displace your wedge from your wood. Once the wood has been split, rinse and repeat steps 1-3 to make smaller sections of wood or to process other pieces of wood. 

Okay - I found that both my Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership) and my Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills) have pretty good advice about lightning. I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is the book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America. I don't think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground). As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe "shadow zone" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground. From Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition): You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - reduce - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can't find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn't say how steep the cliff should be, though. If you enter a cave for shelter (or dive under a boulder) - you must have at least 3m head room (so - 5m total) and 1m to either side. From The Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 6th Edition): These guys are pretty clear: 

The main reason for focusing on smaller sections of the wood/log is that it helps prevent one of the biggest problems that improper batoning has: getting your wedge stuck. This is why the majority of people who baton use a knife of decent size (more blade spine to baton while processing the wood). If the wood is not split by the time your wedge has sunk fully in the wood, you're going to have to remove it (this often involves a groan, a smattering of grunts, and usually a few expletives) and try a different position. After processing a few bundles worth of wood, you'll likely get the feel for what will, and will not, nicely split. Safety concerns of baton selection: Batons should not be made of metal. I cannot stress this enough. Metal-on-metal contacts can damage your wedge and creates a safety hazard, such as flying shards. I have personally had to remove a few shards from the arm of my jacket when I was tired and absentmindedly used the back of an older camp axe as a baton. General safety: While this may seem safer, you are still swinging a solid object and working with a blade. Treat anybody who's batoning with the same considerations you would give to somebody swinging an axe. Let me know if I left anything out or need to clarify anything. 

I recently took a short camping trip with a couple of friends when we encountered some intermittent showers. I foolishly forgot to check the forecast and forgot my waterproof jacket. I was handed an umbrella and managed to stay relatively (cheap construction didn't stand up to PNW rain) dry the rest of the trip. What should I look for in an umbrella for use in the backcountry and/or backpacking? While I do not mind a researched answer, I prefer an experience-based answer. Note: I am not dead-set on this as a replacement for rain gear. I am considering it as a supplement and possible alternative to a hooded outer shell. 

This might sound a bit daft - but you could be holding on to the rock too tightly. Your other questions indicate you might be pretty new to climbing, and it is common for beginners to make this mistake. Primarily, you should be climbing with your legs - pushing your weight up. Legs are used to your weight - arms, and fingertips, are not. If you are steady on your legs - especially if you are able to get your leg straight so you are standing through bone and not relying on a bent knee - then you should only need to use your hands for balancing yourself. Obviously, there are times when you really do need to grip harder, and even pull yourself up rather than push, but climbing is as much a thinking game as it is physical, and planning your moves goes a long way to preventing fatigue and injury. Treating joint pain - ice packs probably help. I'd also think about taking an anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen or aspirin (not at the same time). 

I would inspect your rope long before you get to the crag, rather than just before you're about to use/need it. Rope inspection is essentially going over the whole length of the rope, looking for grit or evidence of wear in the outer layer. One thing to note, the inside of the rope might have been strained and this isn't easily visible from the outside - sometimes you can feel the outer layer sliding over these areas. Rope has a shelf-life - but this also depends on how often you use it. Another rule of thumb to follow is that if you have taking one major outdoor lead fall on the rope (from above protection), then you retire it. You can take several minor falls before retiring it. Top-rope falls should almost have negligible effect - unless there was a lot of slack in the system for some reason and the climber fell more than a couple of metres or so. If, at any time, you are not confident in your rope - replace it. The price is worth a lot less than a climbing injury.
