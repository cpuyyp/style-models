I think I understand what you mean and the answer is: specifically no; but generally yes. If we look out into space, we can divide up what we can see into redshift slices of arbitrary thickness. The light we see from galaxies in each slice has been travelling for a certain amount of time, so we are seeing that "piece of space" at a particular cosmic epoch corresponding to its redshift. If we look past that galaxy to a higher redshift slice, then what we are seeing there is a different patch of space at a younger cosmic epoch. i.e You cannot see the same galaxy as it was at a different time. We see each and every galaxy only once. But in general you will be seeing younger galaxies at higher redshift. In an LCDM model then smaller galaxies build up into larger ones, so there will be a higher density of galaxies at higher redshifts (even after accounting for cosmic expansion), but the galaxies they will produce by merging etc. are not yet visible to us. It is possible that we will see them in the future (depending on the exact values of the cosmological parameters and what redshift we are talking about) as that distant patch of space recedes from us and becomes older (in cosmic terms). 

What governs the Earth's orbital period is its orbital angular momentum and the mass of the Sun. Two events have certainly changed the Earth's orbital period (a) whatever collision formed the Moon and (b) the continuous process of mass loss from the Sun. A third possibility (c) is that tidal torques from the Sun have increased the angular momentum of the Earth. Given that (a) probably happened sometime in the first tens of millions of years and likely did not alter the Earth's angular momentum greatly - it depends on the speed, mass and direction of the impactor and the amount of mass lost from the Earth-Moon system - I will ignore it. (b). It seems, from observations of younger solar analogues, that the mass loss from the early Sun was much greater thanthe modest rate at which it loses mass now via the solar wind. A review by Guedel (2007) suggests a mass loss rate over the last 4.5 billion years that increases as $t^{-2.3}$ (with considerable uncertainty on the power law index), where $t$ is time since birth, and suggests an initial solar mass between 1% and 7% larger than it is now. Conservation of angular momentum and Kepler's third law means that $a \propto M^{-1}$ and $P \propto M^{-2}$. Therefore the Earth's orbital period was 2-14% shorter in the past due to solar mass loss, but has been close to its current value for the last 2-3 billion years. If the solar wind power law time dependence is very steep, then most of the mass loss occurred early, but the total mass loss would have been greater. On the other hand, a lower total mass loss implies a shallower mass loss and the earth spending a longer time in a smaller orbit. (c) The tidal torque exerted by the Sun on the Earth-Sun orbit increases the orbital separation, because the Sun's rotation period is shorter than the Earth's orbital period. The Sun's tidal "bulge" induced by the Earth applies a torque that increases the orbital angular momentum, much like the effect of the Earth on the Moon. Quantifying this is difficult. The tidal torque on a planet from a the Sun is $$ T = \frac{3}{2} \frac{k_E}{Q} \frac{GM_{\odot}^{2} R_{E}^{5}}{a^6},$$ where $R_E$ is an Earth radius and $k_E/Q$ is the ratio of the tidal Love number and $Q$ a tidal dissipation factor (see Sasaki et al. (2012). These lecture notes suggest values of $k_E/Q\sim 0.1$ for the Earth and therefore a tidal torque of $4\times 10^{16}$ Nm. Given that the orbital angular momentum of the Earth is $\sim 3\times 10^{40}$ kgm$^2$s$^{-1}$, then the timescale to change the Earth's angular momentum (and therefore $a$ and $P$) is $>10^{16}$ years and thus this effect is negligible. 

There is no 1:1 mapping between density and composition/structure. You have to look at detailed planetary models. For example, some hot Jupiters are extremely dense ($\geq 10$ g/cm$^3$) but they are undoubtedly gas giants. The origins of this diversity are the source of much speculation and theory, but are certainly within the realms of known physics. An example of the difficulties can be gleaned from this plot from Lissauer et al. (2014) that shows the mass-radius plane for small planets together with the loci of models for various compositions. Lines of constant density are drawn on the plot too, but notice that a planet of a given composition can have a range of densities depending on its mass. 

By way of starting a discussion, because I don't clearly see how to answer this question correctly or all the factors that may be involved. If you increase $G$, then by the virial theorem, the central temperature of the ball of gas (that will contract quasti-statically, since radiation cannot escape unimpeded) will be proportional to $GM/R$. So for a fixed mass, the ignition temperature for nuclear fusion will be reached at a larger radius and stars would be physically larger and less dense. $$T_c \simeq \frac{GMm_u}{10Rk_B},$$ assuming an ionised hydrogen gas and where $m_u$ is an atomic mass unit. In order to avoid "starhood", you need to compress the gas either to within its Schwarzschild radius or to a density where it could be supported by electron degeneracy pressure without reaching a high enough temperature to ignite hydrogen fusion. Considering the first of these. $R_s = 2GM/c^2$, so the central temperature reached at $R=R_s$ would be $\simeq m_u c^2/20k_B = 5\times 10^{11}$K, is independent of $G$ and is far higher than the $10^{7}$K required for H fusion (ignore deuterium). So direct collapse to a black hole cannot circumvent nuclear fusion. The second possibility is likely to be more constraining. There is a standard treatment given in Shapiro & Teukolsky (1983) thaat determines the radius $R$ at which electron degeneracy becomes important in supporting a star of a given mass $M$. The idea is that you work out the mass and radius for which the phase space occupied by an electron approaches $h^3$. The result is (for ionised hydrogen): $$ R/R_{\odot} \simeq 0.07 (M/M_{\odot})^{-1/3}$$ However, digging into the maths a bit, this can be written as a proportionality $$ R \propto G^{-1} M^{-1/3}$$ and thus the central temperature at which electron degeneracy pressure becomes important will be $$T_c \propto GM/R \propto G^2 M^{4/3}$$ Thus (for a fixed $G$) what happens is that a contracting ball of gas will reach a critical $T_c$ for fusion if the mass exceeds some critical threshold (above about $0.075M_{\odot}$ in our universe) then H fusion will begin before degeneracy sets in. If you increase $G$ then this threshold actually becomes smaller and smaller balls of gas will become stars. But what about the Chandrasekhar mass? In our universe the threshold mass for fusion is much lower than the Chandrasekhar mass ($5.8M_{\odot}$ for pure hydrogen), so there is no problem in supporting an object just below the fusion threshold with electron degeneracy pressure. Dig a little deeper and we find that the Chandrasekhar mass is in fact $M_{Ch} \propto G^{-3/2}$. This means we can now express the critical central temperature in terms of mass as a fraction of the Chandrasekhar mass. $$ T_c \propto G^2 \left(\frac{M}{M_{Ch}}\right)^{4/3} (G^{-3/2})^{4/3} \propto \left(\frac{M}{M_{Ch}}\right)^{4/3}$$ In other words, the threshold between a star that burns hydrogen and an object (brown dwarf) that will be supported by degeneracy pressure is a fixed fraction of the Chandrasekhar mass and does not depend on $G$. My conclusion is therefore that although changing $G$ will do interesting things to stellar evolution (changing the rate at which it occurs for instance - see here where I show that the luminosity scales as $G^7$ and therefore lifetimes scale as $G^{-7}$ !), I do not think that changing $G$ allows direct collapse to a black hole without the central temperature becoming high enough to initiate hydrogen fusion. Secondly, a failed star is possible in our universe - it just needs to be less than $0.075M_{\odot}$ and collapse is halted by electron degeneracy pressure. In a universe with an increased $G$ this threshold becomes smaller as $G^{-3/2}$. 

It is tempting to think that non-degenerate stars covers it, since even the structure of the lowest mass main sequence stars are not significantly affected by fermion degeneracy. Unfortunately the cores of more advanced evolutionary stages can become degenerate. So I would go with nuclear-burning stars, although this in turn excludes pre main sequence stars. In some ways it is easier to say a star that is not a compact stellar remnant. 

Well to quote the wikipedia page on the Leonids: "The Leonids are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel-Tuttle." So if a meteorite falls to Earth during the Leonids, it may have originated in Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Unfortunately, there appears to be no conclusive evidence that any particular meteorite came from any particular Comet. The problem is that we do not have direct samples of cometary material to compare against. See for example Swindles & Campin 2004, though somebody may know of something more recent? 

Your vantage point changes throughout the year as the Earth moves around the solar-system barycentre (close to the centre of the Sun). That means the positions of nearby stars "wiggle" with respect to more distant background stars, with a period of one year; the amplitude of this wiggle is how you determine the parallax distance to the object. In the case of Sirius AB, this wiggle is superimposed on a motion caused by the binary orbit of the two components in the Sirius AB system and by the motion of the Sirius system with respect to the Sun projected onto the plane of the sky - the proper motion. 

No, stars do not have a rocky core. They start as clouds of gas, become gravitationally unstable and collapse. Some planets are thought to start this way too - though probably not the ones in our solar system, because the outer three three giant planets have solid cores and Jupiter is likely to also. The two modes of giant planet formation are reviewed in detail by D'Angelo et al. (2010). 

The dark matter model that is used to explain the "missing mass" problem relating to our Galactic rotation curve, consists of a pseudo-spherical distribution that is much more extended than the visible stars and gas. Even though this "halo" contains more than ten times the mass of the visible matter, when you work out what it's density should be in the solar neighbourhood, it turns out to be around 100 times less than the "normal" interplanetary medium. This means, that inside the Earth's orbit, there could be as much as $10^{10}$ kg of dark matter. This sounds a lot and in principle, yes, this would speed up the orbits of planets in a way that depended on their distance from the Sun. However, the predicted effects of this are still about 6 orders of magnitude below the current precision of measurement. 

To answer a question, we do need the source of information (wikipedia just isn't good enough). According to the SIMBAD database, delta Pavonis is a G8 subgiant, with a temperature of 5512K and a $\log g$ of 4.23 (in cgs units) (Gray et al. 2006), which looks correct for a subgiant classification. The metallicity is given as $+0.13$ in the same source. There are a large number of other spectroscopic determinations of the star's parameters listed in the SIMBAD measurements. All seem to agree on the subgiant nature, but for example Bensby et al. (2014) makes the star a little warmer (5635 K) and more metal rich (+0.37). So what appears to be at odds with this is the age/mass combination that you quote. The wikipedia entry and information you quote appears to be taking information from Takeda et al. (2007). They estimate the age and mass of the star from the temperature and gravity using a Bayesian fitting method and the YREC stellar evolution models. If this is really important to you, then you need to read the Takeda et al. paper. They show that the posterior probability distribution of age and mass can have multiple peaks. In the case of delta Pavonis it appears that wikipedia has got things wrong (what a surprise). The age that is quoted is actually for a secondary peak in the posterior probability distribution. The secondary peak in the mass distribution is for $M= 1.101M_{\odot}$. I think that age, mass pair makes much more sense. They do not provide detailed information/discussion on individual cases. Like you, I cannot see how they arrive at 1 solar mass for a star of any age, unless they have picked up a pre main sequence solution in the HR diagram - for which the age corresponding to 1 solar mass would be very small. However, they claim that their models start at the ZAMS. The fact that they list no primary peak in the age posterior pdf suggest to me that the pdf look like a declining function from zero (the ZAMS), with a secondary peak at the 7Gyr (quoted by wikipedia). This then suggests that this secondary solution is also not a brilliant fit and that the fitting process would really have liked to make this younger than ZAMS - i.e. a PMS star (which it isn't). In turn then, this may suggests that the gravity used by Takeda et al. might be too low. Takeda et al. used spectroscopically derived parameters of temperature 5590 K, $\log g= 4.31$ and $[M/H]=+0.26$ from Valenti & Fischer (2005). These authors also did their own isochrone fits to these parameters finding $M=1.045 \pm 0.058 M_{\odot}$ and an age of 5.3-6.8 Gyr. They say that the mass at the best-fitting isochronal age is $1.07M_{\odot}$. I think part of what is puzzling you is that you have to remember that having a metal content that is twice the Sun's does affect the evolutionary tracks considerably. It is not that the evolutionary timescales are massively different, but the effective temperature of the star is changed considerably for a given mass and age.
