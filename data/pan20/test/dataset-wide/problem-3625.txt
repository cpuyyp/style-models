Please, remember that maybe I have a gymnecomastia. By the way, my sternum is quite large and the muscle insertions at the center of the pectorals are very short : pectorals appear to be espaced (a bit more than my thumb). The bottom of the pectorals are still more espaced AND it's very rounded. The combination of 2. and 3. results in that my pectorals don't have a very large surface : only 12 cm 4.7 inches from left to right, at approx. 3cm from the top of my pectorals. Measures were taken only for my left one. My right pectoral seems to have still less surface than my left one (in both horizontal and vertical directions) : there is, maybe, left-right asymmetry. I think anterior deltoid, my back and my triceps are too developped compared with my pectorals. When I bench and do my cross over, I try to desollicit my anterior deltoids by puting them at back. I try also to keep my back on the bench... Since my arms are not very long, exercizes like inclined bench should be useful to isolate the top of my pectorals. I'm not going any lower than the parallel to the ground in benches. 

I would start with doing a lot of cardio exercise. According to recent research, underweight people tend to have a larger fat percentage than average people, in some cases they are actually as fat as mildly obese people. This fat is hidden in the body as visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). The person is then underweight because he/she has smaller organs. This puts these people at a greater risk of developing diabetes and heart disease. It is therefore recommended to build up cardio fitness and work toward being able to run fast for more than half an hour, 4 to 5 times per week. At the same time the diet should be adjusted to limit any weight loss, but you will lose a bit of weight due to losing excess visceral fat. After about a year you should have made a lot of progress in building up cardio fitness. Only then should you start doing strength training. Your body will then be better adapted to doing heavy lifting work. Even though you'll still have to build up your muscles, your heart rate won't go up nearly as much as if you were to do this right away; you'll feel less exhausted after heavy exercise. The problem with getting tired after exericise is that your body will tend to keep the fat reserves. So, the food you eat is then used in a less efficent way to build a stronger body. 

For any exercise AND for hypertrophy and/or nervous system, is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction ? Consider my training. 

Almost always no coffee nor tea. My training Supersets I always used supersets, in each of my workouts. For example, bench press + lat chest pulldown. These supersets, however, defer from what we commonly understand by "superset" (according to the moment of the workout of a given day) : on monday, at the end of my workout, I do Low pulley cross-over in "superset" with Side raises. Choice of the weights AND Realization of the movements Since Septembre, 2018, I can't tell you with accuracy how I chose the weights and how I realized the movements. Since approximately March, 2018, I followed this protocol : 

My question How should I change my training to have better pectorals, considering my poor pectorals anatomy and all of these informations ? Pictures $URL$ 

40 sec + 20 sec = 1 min, so the time under tension is 1 min, realized with a great load (because it hurts me from 40 sec). These both constraints imply a great mechanical stress. From 40 sec, my weights hurt me and I use supersets : it implies a great hormonal stress. Obviously, I have congestion : metabolic stress 

Make sure the roti is made from whole-wheat flour, the rice should be brown rice and the bread should be whole grain bread. Also, make sure you eat at least 400 grams of vegetables during the day. The exercise you do should have sufficient intensity, you should measure how fast you run during that 20 minutes. If the pace is slower than about 13 km/h then you should run for a shorter time at a faster pace and gradually increase the running time until you can run for 20 minutes at a pace faster than 13 km/h, and then increase the time to 30 minutes, 40 minutes, etc. until you are able to run an hour at this pace (and that at least 5 times per week). But it can take a few years of hard exercise to get there. 

First you must understand why you can't lose weight by eating a bit more or less. It is instructive to watch this documentary. If you eat more your metabolic rate increases while if you eat less your metabolic rate decreases, the whole point of that is to make sure your fat reserves don't get depleted over time. Your problem is that your body is regulating your metabolic rate to keep your present fat reserves constant, while you would probably rather have a lower weight. The way to lose weight in your case (a person who isn't obese who just wants to lose a modest amount of weight) is to first shift the equilibrium between energy use and expenditure to much higher levels. So instead of, say, 1500 Kcal consumption and energy use, you should build up your fitness levels, exercise a lot harder and shift that to, say, 2800 kcal or more energy intake and energy use. At that higher level, your body will all by itself transform itself to have lower body fat level simply because that's more optimal for that case (fat reserves are no longer useful, it's more ballast standing in the way of physical exercise, there is plenty of energy coming in anyway). In that case, you can eat a bit less to let the body reconfigure to a lower weight a bit faster. While it then looks like you lost weight by changing the energy balance, in reality you just facilitated the weight loss that your body wanted to implement anyway. In contrast, if you don't exercise a lot your present weight is simply the set point for your body. Eating a bit less won't work because your body wants to be at your present weight. You would need to drastically reduce the calorie intake to force your body to lose weight. But then you'll gain back your old weight once you start to eat a normal diet again. The only way to change this calculus is to change what your own body wants to keep as its fat reserves, and that requires becoming an athlete for whom your present fat reserve constitutes ballast that your body then wants to get rid off. 

Powerlifting or Aesthetism (speaking about all exercizes) ? Dumbells or bar (only speaking about pectorals exercizes) ? Since 1st september, 2018, I was used to do 5 powerlifting series (each one during only 20 sec) followed by 2 aesthetism series (each one during approx. 1 minute or a bit more, I wasn't as precise as I am now and thus I didn't measure). At bench press only AND for PL series only, I used bar. I can't remember if weither or not these both types of series followed any of the above protocols. Since 1st March, 2018, I only do 2 aesthetism series (each following PROTOCOL #2). I only use dumbells. My pre-training (warming-up) consists in increasing the weights until I reach the first serie's weighs. 4 series of warming are dedicated to that and it's called "potentiation" ; I never reach nervous/muscle fatigue during these series. I always used potentation. My pectorals exercizes 

Before I show you my photos taken from different angles, I want to explain how I train. Biological informations AND Diseases I'm a 22.5yo male, 1.70m (67 inches), I think I'm between [20 ; 25]% BF. I think I have a pelvic anteversion. From June, 2017 to April, 2018, I suffered from sevear chronic insomnias (<5 hours, quite often 2 sleep hours). Since April, 2018, these insomnias are mostly cured. I think I have a gymnecomastia (since a lot of years and I believe it's due to hormones). Training dates Before september 2018, I trained all muscles (excepted back in thickness and lumbars) only with small weights (<= 20kg 44lb) during several months spaced by pauses of several months... Well I don't think these weird periods are actually important to take account. I seriously began musculation 9 months ago (i.e. : since september, 2018). Food Since I was 19, I always payed attention in excluding sodas and sweet things. From september to 1st may, 2018, I think I didn't eat I haven't eaten enough proteins for example (only 2 eggs per day whereas I eat 4 now). After 1st may, 2018, a typical day is : 

It's easy to check if you have diabetes or not, just do a blood test, but 110 oz = 3.25 liters and that's a normal amount of water. Unless you have heart failure or a severely compromised kidney function it's a safe and good amount of water to drink. The amount of water you should drink to make up for water lost due to sweating is 1.5 times the amount you lost (you need to compensate for the amount that the kidneys will discharge when you drink water). But you should not drink more than about 0.8 liters per hour. So, if you weigh yourself before and after exercise and you find that you lost 1 kg of weight, then you should drink 1.5 liters over the course of the next two hours. 

You should eat a normal diet with a normal amount of calories. The weight loss toward an ideal weight should come from gains in physical fitness. Suppose in the future you weigh 70 kg, you are eating 2500 Kcal/day and you are physically very fit. If you then have equilibrium between consumed energy and energy expenditure at 2500 Kcal/day, then why can't such an equilibrium be reached now? So, clearly, you should be able to eat a lot more and yet stay at your present way or even lose some weight. 

Finally, my training is extremely complete. But within my 40 sec and within my 20 sec of work, I realized that doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (I'm used to do it - NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) impede me from doing [5 ; 7] repetitions. If I don't do any pause (not speaking about rest-pauses !) these [5 ; 7] repetitions are done without great difficulty (i.e. : without hurt). Thus, stopping from doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction implies a possible augmentation of the weights, since the used ones don't hurt me anymore. Otherwise, I would exceed my time under tension of 1 min and that's not good (i.e. : I don't want to use the energy chain of slow fibres). My question Would you recommend me to stop doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) in order to allow me to augment my weights ? In other words : is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction that would deencourages me from stoping such a pause ? This benefit could be on hypertrophy or nervous system. Would you recommend me a periodization of that, i.e. : doing pauses at maximum of the contraction on Monday for an exercise A, and not on Thursday for this exercise A ? 

I agree with the spirit of cocojay's answer but I favor a more moderate approach. For cardio you should increase the speed a bit, I would recommend that you measure your heart rate while you exercise and make sure it is around 150 bpm or a bit higher. Before you do that you should make sure there are no medical issues here, if you are not sure you should first check with your doctor. Then, you may find that you can only do this for ten minutes. You should then try to increase the exercise time, e.g. via interval training or simply by sticking to the ten minutes for a while until you feel that you exercise for longer. The rule of thumb is that you should not increase the time by more than 10% in one go. As you get fitter, you will not only be able to cycle for longer, but you will also be able to cycle faster at the same heart rate. The rule of thumb for good cardio-fitness is the power to weight ratio. If you divide the amount of sustained power you can deliver (say for 20 minutes) in Watts divided by your weight in Kg, then this ratio should be 3 or higher. But then you are doing a maximum effort while in exercise sessions you should go slower. For you this amounts to about 220 Watt of power. Another measure is the heart rate recovery rate. If you exercise for, say, 20 minutes at a heart rate of 150 bpm, then you can measure how fast your heart rate goes down if you significantly reduce the effort. It should drop by at least 30 bpm per minute in the first minute, so after one minute you should be below 120 bpm. Your resting heart rate should also get lower over time, but this is a less reliable measure for fitness. If you do this and you keep good track of your cardio fitness, then as you gain experience with increasing your cardio fitness, you should work toward increasing this to about an hour per day. You will likely only start to lose weight when you are exercising more than half an hour per day at high intensity. I would not recommend dieting, as that will interfere with building your fitness up to top level. It is far better to become stronger first which then will lead to an increase in your base metabolic rate to above 3000 Kcal/day. You will then gradually lose a bit of weight as your body reconfigures itself. So, you will actually start to eat a lot more and still lose a bit of weight. I lost a bit of weight from about 62 kg to 57 kg over the course of about 6 years. I gradually increased my fitness from running 20 minutes per day 3 times per week to 50 minuted 5 times per week now. But I eat a lot more than I did 6 years ago. Had I restricted my calory intake 6 years ago, I would have lost a bit of weight, but I would not have been physically much fitter. Also, it is likely that visceral fat around the organs could have increased due to dieting. If you tell your body that it is ok not to be superfit and that it can't always count on enough calories, then what is the logical response? Compare that to telling your body that unless it is superfit it may not survive (that's a lie but the cells in your body dont know that you are only exercising hard for fun), but that it can always count on enough calories. Obviously your body will respond differently in this case.
