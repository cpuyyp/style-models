There are a lot of unspecified variables involved here... type of socks, fit of the shoe/boot, type of shoe, conditions you are hiking in, etc. But in general, double-socking may offer the following which may help prevent blisters: 

This isn't pretty, and seems to be somewhat limited in locations (I couldn't get it to work for my area) but this looks to have potential. Though there is no "subscribe" feature. National Weather Service Weather Activity Planner (Example) 

This gets into the realm of "personal preference" but I would suggest only tie those things on the outside of your pack that you don't want at the end of the day. Anything on the outside will tend to get chewed up by brush, be-thorned by cactus, ground into rocks and dirt every time you set your pack down, get soaked when you slip on that stream crossing, and... yes... fall off. Your sleeping bag is a great item to pack FIRST inside the back to provide some padding in that lower lumbar region which will be rubbing against your body. 

Say you have a cooler of frozen food and ice to last for several days or weeks of river-trip / car camping. To keep things as a cold as possible for as long as possible, is it better to leave the cold melted ice-water in, or to drain it out on a regular basis? 

To wash any pack, you are pretty safe using a large commercial front-loading washer (found at many laundr-o-mats in the US) and regular detergent, then letting it drip-dry. Remove any removable buckles/straps first to prevent loss/damage (to both the pack and machine). For your white pack, a few thoughts: 

**Sidebar: Several sources suggest that sports beverages can actually increase risk of hyponatremia since their deliciously tasty tangy sweetness can cause one to drink more fluid than they would otherwise. Advice from the doctor at the Grand Canyon clinic as reported in the Wilderness Medicine Institute regarding the issue: 

First of all you need to control what is life threatening. Control the bleed. Lay them down and elevate the wound if necessary. Apply sterile dressings (or the closest thing you have to sterile). As it continues to bleed apply more dressings. Blood goes through a clotting process and if you pull the dressings it has to start over. Then assess the situation. Get them comfortable and warm. Give them something to drink. Ask them how they feel and if they are on medication. Clean the wound is secondary at this time. Make a long term plan. If are going to extricate and get them to a hospital in a few hours then only clean and dress if you have the materials to do it right. If it is going to be longer than 24 hours to get professional medical care then clean the best you can. If you used everything you have sterile then boil some clothes. Even if you don't have an antiseptic you have soap. You will find products call first aid antiseptic. Good old soap is better than whiskey. It not realistic to carry the volume of peroxide required to irrigate a wound in the back country. If you have a wound like that then you need to make plans to get them to a medical facility. You don't have a big rush. You are not going to have a serious infection in 48 hours. Just a cut cooking is not likely to be life threatening. Control the bleed with a dressing. Clean with soap and water. Then some antiseptic if you have it. I don't see using whiskey unless you don't even have soap. Let it dry and apply the best dressing you have. If you are out of sterile dressing then boil some clothes and hang them out to dry. An up to date first aid kit can mean a lot of stuff. Build your own and take a first aid class. American Red Cross has a wilderness first aid. Ony in the back country would you be in a situation of longer term care. No off the shelf first aid kit is going have the volume to control a major bleed and that is what is going to kill some one. 

Short Answer: In the US, laws regulating land use are detailed and varied, even on Public Lands. Check with the local land agency before "roaming." Long Answer: Loosely you can divide open space in the US into two main categories: Private and Public. Private Land: The laws governing private land vary by state. In Texas, for example, a landowner is well within his rights to shoot trespassers that he "reasonably feels" are threatening him, or his property. (Known as the Castle Law - as in a Man's Home is His Castle). Property lines becomes hazy with regards to river right-of ways (canoeing / kayaking) with some areas defining public right-of-way as the waterline, others as the flood-line. In general, as long as you stay in your boat, you should be able to pass through private land, but you might not be allowed to fish from their banks. Public Land: The rules concerning public land vary between agencies. State Parks, State Forests, National Parks, National Monuments, National Forests, BLM (Bureau of Land Management) Land, National Wildlife Refuges, National Grasslands... etc. Even Within each of these, there will be differences in what you are allowed to do. Wilderness, Primitive, Roadless are some of the different sub-sections you might find within a single National Forest, or National Park or BLM Land. Most regulations regard the usage of vehicles (where you can and can't drive) and camping. But some rules apply to hiking as well. The most restrictive are usually National Parks and Monuments - which often have permit systems for overnight hiking, and designated camping areas. National Forests vary widely on whether you need a permit or not, especially concerning Wilderness areas, which might limit usage / group size to protect the resource. These might also include where you can camp (distance from bodies of water) whether you can have camp fires, etc... or even whether you need a permit. These regulations vary by National Forest. Generally, however, on non-Wilderness, National Forest or BLM land, you are free to travel on any established, marked road, and camp in any established dispersed camping area (ie, one already barren and obviously been used for camping). Limits on how long you are allowed to stay exist (usually 14 days). Conclusion: The US has an awesome system of public lands (quite possibly the country's most redeeming property). However, the right to roam (or the regulation against) varies widely. Check with the local Public Land's office when you arrive in an area to determine what is or is not allowed. (And why... Surprisingly, most of the rules are in place to help protect the resource from over-use, not to ruin your trip.) As for whether these rules are a "bureaucratic formality": No. Ignoring the regulations are a tickit-able misdemeanor that carries the same weight as a traffic violation, punishable by fines and jail time. In reality, most carry a modest fine, but failure to pay can result in your arrest. And, as is the case with all laws in the US - Ignorance of the law is no excuse for violating it. 

In the U.S. there are legal definitions provided by code (18 USC 921) and regulation (27 CFR 478.11), which are somewhat derived from the customary definitions. A shotgun is designed to shoot shot (i.e., multiple ball projectiles) through a smooth bore. Yes, you can buy rifled shotguns designed to fire a single projectile, but they still shoot shotgun shells, which are large caliber and produce low maximum chamber pressures. I believe the SAAMI MAP (Maximum Average Pressure) for shotshells is always under 12kpsi. And the smallest standard shotshell I'm aware of is .410. A rifle is designed to shoot a single projectile at high pressures through a rifled barrel. It is common to see MAP for rifle cartridges over 60kpsi. And it is extremely uncommon to see a man-portable rifle with a bore larger than .50 caliber*. (And perhaps even less common to find shooters willing to get behind one's trigger ;) So a decent definition could distinguish these firearms primarily by design pressure. It is true that you can find rifle ammunition loaded to lower pressures. You can even find some corner cases where a rifle is loaded to fire more than one projectile â€“ e.g., the M198 "duplex." You managed to find a .22LR "shot shell." That's just a weird product: It's a low pressure round, and its effective range is measured in feet because rifling throws shot into a ridiculously wide "pattern." I.e., you can fire shot through a rifle, but other than as a point-blank "snake" load, or just out of curiosity, you wouldn't want to. It really fouls the rifling, and it doesn't let you hit anything at a distance with any reasonable probability. *ATF exemptions exist, so that's not just because in general rifles over .50 are classified as Destructive Devices. 

One point missing from the current answers: Fixed blade is absolutely essential in any situation where seconds count in emergency life-or-death situations. For example, anything taking place in or under water where you might need to free yourself (or another) from an entrapment. In these situations, you also want one with a secure but quick-release sheath. 

I never understood the appeal of trekking poles until I started carrying 80+ lbs packs down into the bottom of the Grand Canyon for a living. Now, I wish I had started using them sooner. Perhaps my knees would be in better shape. Trekking poles, used properly, can take countless TONS of cumulative weight off your knees and lower back by shifting that weight (and impact) to your arms. They excel at ascents and descents (and their benefits are more noticeable) but can also add some benefit on relatively level walking. There are lots of guides to tell you the "proper" way to use them, but in my experience, every person uses them a little differently. But, in general: planting your right pole in front of you as you step your left leg forward while consciously engaging your arm to take some weight off your lower body as you step your right leg forward (while planting your left pole). Follow through with the stroke, and you can even push yourself forward a bit before bringing your pole back to the front. It takes some getting used to, and to incorporate it into your stride. As for other gear / techniques to help with back (and other) pain: 

Shake the bag vigorously from all directions Fluff the bag like a pillow -- slap, punch and clap it Feel for clumps of down in the bag and gently pull them apart with your hands Place the bag in a large commercial tumble dryer on air (no heat) with a couple of tennis balls tossed in 

Mixed has had limited use. A wide range just does not make sense as you would just tear up the smaller game. Even with similar sizes would get longer shot strings (smaller slow down faster) so a moving target at a distance you are guaranteed to miss with part. If you do some pattern testing you are likely to get a mixed pattern bigger than the smaller shot alone. 

Sure looks like a high gloss sealant to me. Clean the rock up and apply a high gloss concrete/masonry sealant to the other side and I bet you get a match. Or take a wire brush to they shiny side. Hard to believe it is a natural occurrence when the rock next to it has no shine. 

It is not clear how they scraped but I would try a tool like is used for scraping tile off a floor. Then sweep the chips off. Then add a small amount of hot water to the problem spots. For a squeegee I would look at a roller squeegee like is used for tennis courts. 

You asked about access the tree. Inspect it. Push on it. Look for bugs. Knock on it - if it sounds hollow that is not good. Try and break off limbs - if they break easy that is not good. Assuming you cannot find a spot in a clearing then look for protection like large rocks or fallen trees. If you have climbing gear you could tie it off. 

There is a bit to it. A book like Freedom of the Hills has excellent instructions with illustrations. If it is solid ice you cannot break through then this is not going to work. Practice on your own, with a group, and / or go to a school. Practice on a slope that has a slide out so you will stop even if not successful. Often if there is a chance of a fall you will be roped up. If you have some inexperience climbers then rope up. If you fall call out to the lead. Roped is about the same but you can get tangled up. It is best if you are tethered to the ax. The grip is three fingers around the pick and thumb around the shaft (different from a self belay grip). If you are not in the position before you slip you are going to have trouble The braking position is face down head up (hill) dig the pick on same side shoulder or slight above, shaft across your body held near the bottom near your waist with your other hand, and head look away and down. Knees spread slightly and feet up. Raise your butt to put more force on the pick. You can fall in 5 positions face down head up (hill) face down head down face up head up face up head down tumble On descent you are more likely to fall head down. Face up head up is best as you can get the axe in position. Roll toward the pick (very important). Face down head up if you are not in position then role to your back to the side of the pick, get axe in position, and role back. Face down head down then above your head to the side dig in the pick and swing into position. This takes some strength and practice. Will need the axe in position before you hit the ground. Face up head down you. Across your hips dig the pick in and spin around and rotate to face down at the proper moment. Scary. You really just need to practice. If you are not lead you need the rope outside the pick so you need determine which side they are going to pass and fall on the other side of the rope. Roped up if someone drops in a crevasse same thing so you need to have rescue grip on flat snow. 

I regularly use a machete to clear brush. I must be using the wrong technique for the tool ... or the wrong tool given my technique. In order to maximize the speed of the blade, I rotate my wrist forward before it strikes wood. This causes the pommel to dig into the lunar pad (bottom face opposite the thumb) and quickly blister it. Shown here is my starting grip: 

I have a lot of knives that are 20-30 years old, and I've never spent more than $100 on any knife. Have there been appreciable advances in the steels or treatments applied to mainstream knives over this period? I.e., are there knives available today under $100 that would perform noticeably better than anything I might have bought for that price a generation ago? I know that a lot of differences in blades amount to tradeoffs between durability, flexibility, corrosion resistance, etc. So an "advance" would be something like, "significantly better in at least one measure without sacrificing performance in any other measure." 

"Buck and ball" loads are commonly available. They're often marketed for self defense, but where legal for hunting they have the same benefits on game, namely: The "ball" (or slug) has more reach for aimed shots on further targets, but if you happen to get a closer-in target you have the "insurance" and added stopping-power of the buckshot. 

How can I determine whether a shotgun fits (or can be easily adapted to fit) me without having the chance to test fire it? (And without spending thousands of dollars for a customization?) Whether for shooting clays or birds we know that "fit" of a shotgun to a shooter can be critical to the shooter's ability to hit what he points at. When I take people clay shooting I bring several different guns. Even with first-time shooters I can see that if they're missing wildly with one gun, simply handing them another with a stock of different proportions can allow them to start making consistent hits. Can this sort of general shotgun fitment be done without access to a range? If so, how?
