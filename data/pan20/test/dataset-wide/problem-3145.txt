Nubia The region south of Ancient Egypt interacted with it in various ways, conquering and trading with each other. Nubia even contributed some pharaohs, who (along with Nubia itself, eventually) assimilated with Egypt because it was the "greater" culture. But there was a lot of Nubian influence: 

Imperial Japan built up an impressive collection of colonies on the Asian mainland due to their uncontested navy and comparatively modern army. Did Japan ever hold any colonies on the mainland before this? Throughout history, Japan has been a seafaring civilization, and such peoples have sometimes held overseas colonies: ancient Greeks in Asia minor, Vikings in Northern Europe and so on. Are there any records of permanent colonies on continental Asia settled by Japanese in the past? 

In 1860, during the Second Opium War with Qing China, combined British and French forces, under British direction, looted and burnt the Old Summer Palace. This was done in retaliation for the killing and torturing of envoys sent for negotiations. The Old Summer Palace (a.k.a. Yuan Ming Yuan) is a large palace complex situated 8km from the Forbidden Palace (the "center" of Beijing) and was used by emperors to conduct affairs. Being a "public" building complex very close to the capital city, its intentional burning fits the question's criteria, although it takes place almost 50 years later. 

This was also the conflict that saw the debut of the venerable AIM-9 Sidewinder AAM. This is probably the only example of a "serious air clash" between PRC and Taiwan. In the closing stages of the Chinese Civil War, the PLA's failure to take small islands like Kinmen exposed serious shortcomings in amphibious capability. The Korean War forced the US to place Taiwan under its protection, and after the cease fire the US turned its attention to Taiwan, sponsoring an invasion of China sparking the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. In reality both sides were woefully incapable of taking over the other - the PRC hampered by its lack of capability and Taiwan's US protection, and Taiwan by its overwhelming numerical disadvantage. The conflict soon reached a stalemate, followed by a gradual thaw in relations over the late 20th century. 

Habiru The Habiru were described in various ancient Near East sources as nomads with various occupations, including mercenaries, but also things such as rebels, raiders, outlaws, and migrant laborers. They may have been related to early Hebrews (the same, or the Habiru includes Hebrews, or they just happen to have similar names). The earliest mention dates to around 1850 BC, describing them as small bands of soldiers, apparently mercenaries serving local city-states. Another mention is on the Tikunani Prism, describing events around 1550 BC, and lists the names of 438 Habiru soldiers serving a local King. 

When you're talking about Ancient Egypt, that's a ridiculously long period of time. Also, like real roots, there are usually many cultural roots rather than a single one, and neighbouring cultures tend to cross-fertilise. That's a lot of roots! If you want to start, just look at Ancient Egypt's powerful neighbours, almost each one has influenced it in some way. So I'll try to categorise them instead of listing every single one. Upper and Lower Egypt Ancient Egypt is the product of the merger of two very ancient kingdoms: Upper and Lower Egypt. Before this there were separate towns. So the two biggest roots of Ancient Egypt are Upper and Lower Egypt. Perhaps the biggest cultural influence is in their mythology: Horus, associated with Upper Egypt, is said to have conquered Set, associated with Lower Egypt. Mesopotamia Mesopotamia, the Cradle of Civilisation and very close to Egypt, is obviously a big influence: 

If you look through lots of photos from that period, you can find plenty of examples of hair with the characteristic hat crease. Given that the pocket comb was once commonly carried by men and women, I imagine that's how most people dealt with hat hair - or not at all, as in the case of the famous hat-wearer, Abraham Lincoln, who had a reputation for very messy hair. 

Angus Maddison provides some historical GDP data on his website. From this data, at around 1000AD the per-capita GDP of Europe is about 425 1990 international dollars (this figure is about 31,000 for 2008 USA). The two stand-outs are Spain and Italy at 450, likely due to trade and contact with the Arab world. Compare this figure to the Middle-Eastern average of 621. It's not a big difference, but economic disparities of that time would have been much lower than today - peasants were more or less equally poor, but to an observer living in those times, the difference would have been easy to spot. 

According to The Art of Native American Basketry: A Living Legacy by Frank Porter, Native American basketry began between 7000 BC and 5000 BC: 

On December 13, 1937 Japan captured Nanjing; from there they could have continued up the Yangtze to attack Wuhan, then the second most populous Chinese city and de facto wartime capital. But ground action only began on June 11, 1938, almost 6 months later. Why did it take this long for Japan to begin the attack on this key strategic city? If we look at a timeline of the battle and preceding actions, we see this: 

It's hard to separate the effects of the posters from the larger effects of mass propaganda, and of using shame as a strategy in general, most notably the notorious White Feather campaign. But the latter's effect is usually seen as effective in the short term, boosting enlistment numbers. Views of the campaign subsequently turned negative, and it wasn't so prevalent during WWII. I suspect that's what the "negative effect" is referring to. The campaign is where young women were encouraged to hand out white feathers - symbols of cowardice - to healthy unenlisted men, in order to shame them into enlisting. Due to gender roles and the view of masculinity at the time, this was effective and helped increase enlistment, but the community quickly took a dim view of the campaign and the women who participated in it, especially when the recipients of the feathers were undeserving, such as discharged servicemen or those on leave, and adolescents. For more info, see The White Feather Campaign: A Struggle with Masculinity During World War I 

So he's probably referring to the siege as the last using those old arms and tactics. The Crimean War as a whole marked many turning points in military technology and tactics - the Charge of the Light Brigade being a famous example, arguably the last of its kind. The changes were brought about by advancements in firearms technology, which Moltke the Elder observed. These changes continued to be seen in the Civil War, where we saw repeating rifles. The devastating effect of newer cannons and firearms made it more effective and crucial to perform coordinated, enveloping attacks, and reduced the effectiveness of line-breaking charges. 

During the end of the Han dynasty, the capital Chang'an fell under control of warlords Li Jue and Guo Si, who fought each other soon after. The emperor Xian escaped and eventually reached the ruins of the old capital, Luoyang. According to Chinese Wikipedia (and other sources), this trip took one year: 

The LCVP or Higgins boat was designed with one primary goal: to land a large number of troops quickly. Therefore it was important that: 

The battle of Tai'erzhuang was the first major Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese war. IJA 10th and 5th divisions, aiming to take Tai'erzhuang and ultimately Xuzhou, were instead held up in Tai'erzhuang and Linyi respectively. Stuck in bloody urban combat and cut off, the 10th division gave up the small town and retreated after suffering significant casualties. There were some crucial errors/failures that the Japanese commanders made: 

This book chapter, "Childhood in History" by Pat Thane, mentions how children dressed in medieval times in brief. For most of medieval Europe, children dressed much as adults did, which is very much like today (with the exception of school uniforms). 

I too would like to hear from a domain expert. My shallow understanding is that it had nothing to do with Soviet influence, but rather the phenomenon known as Islamic revival that lead to increased social/religious conservatism in the Islamic world, from the 70's onwards. You cite the example of Iran as a counterexample to Soviet progressive influence. I argue that it was more or less a worldwide zeitgeist of social liberalisation during the first half of the 20th century, caused by modernisation, experienced by middle eastern countries like Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and so forth. But the advent of the latest episode of Islamic revival, marked by major events like the 1970s energy crisis and the return of Ayatollah Khomeini, reversed many of those effects, and introduced things like increased sharia laws, religious observance (e.g. hajj), and rejection of foreign ideologies like Socialism and Capitalism, since Islamism presented itself as an alternative to these. 

So in order to compare formations, you can divide the number of Chinese divisions by 2 or 3 to get the actual strength in numbers. 

During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, "32 Nationalist Chinese F-86s clashed with 100 Red Chinese MiGs in a series of aerial engagements". 

Most Japanese migration to Manchuria occurred after its occupation and the establishment of Manchukuo in 1931, when it was state-sponsored, and mostly poor rural colonists. But there were smaller-scale migrations before that, numbering in the tens of thousands. During the 1920s, Japan's major commercial venture in Manchuria would be the South Manchurian Railway. Mantetsu was by far the largest Japanese company, employing 35,000 Japanese nationals by 1910, and contributing over a quarter of tax revenues during the 1920s. Its most profitable business was freight transport of soybeans, grown in Manchuria for export, mostly by immigrant Han farmers. In 1931-1932 various estimates claim hundreds of thousands of Japanese nationals in Manchukuo. I would expect the typical Japanese national living in Manchuria in the 1920s to be associated with Mantetsu, its subsidiaries (steel works, plants and mills, businesses dealing with colonial resource extraction), or related to them. He would be a professional, either rich enough to pay for his own immigration or useful enough for his company to pay for it. If he's well off, his whole family may have followed although this would put him in the minority until the 1930s. 

For a relatively brief period in China's Three Kingdoms era, the three states of Wu/Shu/Wei were actively fighting each other. For most of the rest of the time, Wu and Shu were allied in their resistance against the vastly stronger Wei. 

For example, despite having a clear naval supremacy at the time, Athens could not prevent Sparta from landing an intervention force during the Sicilian Expedition. 

Wilful US ignorance of split A minority of the US's Intelligence Community were well aware of the coming split before it became obvious around 1960 and undeniable in 1969. It was widely believed for a long time that the communist bloc stood in solidarity against the West and that shared ideology could trump differences in national interests, and this conviction was hard to shake even in the face of overwhelming evidence. It certainly didn't help that this split developed so soon after the Red Scare; CIA analysts believing in the coming split were considered "heretics". In fact the only major action that the US took to undermine Sino-Soviet relations was its hardline reaction to the U2 spy plane incident which made Khrushev look weak to hardliners, including Mao, and convinced the latter to move away from the USSR. But given that the incident was counterproductive to American interests, it's highly unlikely that this was done deliberately, and the split was well under way at this point. 

There are some assumptions you've made, which are all too easy to do when judging historical events from a modern lens: 

The heir apparent to the British throne (England, then Great Britain, then United Kingdom) is usually conferred the title of Prince of Wales. According to Britannica and Wikipedia, this tradition dates back to 1301 when King Edward I invested his son the future King Edward II. However neither explain why this title was used. Prince of Wales is an unusual title; it is not hereditary, automatic, and doesn't affect succession. It is only a tradition to grant it to the heir apparent. It also has little to do with Wales, as its title holders are neither Welsh, nor born in Wales, nor speak the language. So why was this title used? Was there something special about Wales, or the title itself?

Let's be more specific about what we mean by "de-Stalinization", "de-Maoization" and what they actually entail. Just because we don't call it de-Maoization doesn't mean there weren't drastic political changes after Mao's death, analogous to Stalin's death. True, Mao's images weren't taken down nearly to the same extent as Stalin's were. I assert that this is because of Mao's status as a national founder - because such individuals are so intertwined with a nation's identity, they are somewhat above criticism, despite their numerous sins. But this topic merits a book-length treatment on its own. Instead, let's look at what Deng did do: 

The writing is in cursive and difficult to interpret, but the columns are roughly Date (1859), Location (Hobart), Name (Thomas ???) If you're good at researching this kind of thing, you might be able to pin an exact year. My best guess is somewhere in the 1850s. 

Ancient Libya Very little is known about lands west of Ancient Egypt, but they did at least contribute some pharaohs, who brought some Libyan practices to Egypt, at least for a time. Ancient Greece Even though you most often hear the cultural exchange being one-sided, Egypt to Greece, and Herodotus described the Ancient Egyptians as xenophobic, but there were large Greek settlements in Egypt, so there is probably a little bit of Greek influence. For example, there are some parallels between Homeric epics and the contemporary tales of Setna Khaemweset, although this is pretty weak evidence. Obviously Egypt was later Hellenised after Alexander's conquest, but that also marks the end of Ancient Egypt. 

Status quo ante bellum It's a Latin phrase that describes exactly what you're after - that territories reverted to what they were before the war. It's actually very common; a modern example is the Iran-Iraq war which was brutal and lasted 8 years. Usually this is a result of a treaty, and where one side holding more territory but also wants peace, and as an enticement, offers the other side a restoration of territory. 

Wikipedia claims the last point was the reason for choosing Lu, although this statement is unsupported. Or was it for another reason? Is it more common in Chinese to abbreviate using the second character? 

Soon he was the de-facto paramount leader of the country. If there is one way to describe Deng, I think he was above all a very pragmatic person, as evidenced by his many ideologically-inconsistent policies, and his famous quip "It doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice." When he has ultimate power and can enact his policies without opposition, what further need is there to demonise Mao? Now let's look at de-Stalinization; note that even Khrushchev wasn't completely consistent in his criticism of Stalin; the pre-1934 abuses like the famine or the struggles with Trotsky etc. were ignored. So when you look at why these powerful politicians do what they do, above all you need to look at what their intent was, what they stand to gain or lose. Khrushchev's aim was, as with Deng, to consolidate his power. Unlike Deng, Khrushchev can be somewhat reckless, as seen again later with the Cuban Missile gambit which spectacularly failed. Here the "secret speech", highly critical of Stalin, caused shock and disillusionment throughout the Soviet states and contributed to revolts in Poland and Hungary later. One could argue that, even though Khrushchev wasn't thorough in his criticism of Stalin, he went too far given how intertwined Stalin is to the legitimacy of the USSR. Indeed, soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the erratic Khrushchev was ousted and replaced by the more conservative Brezhnev. 

After the Nationalists consolidated power in China in 1928, their government promptly received international recognition. Therefore there was little reason to claim descent from the Beiyang regime. All except Japan, that is. Due to having poor relations with the Nationalists and harboring ambitions in China, they set up puppet regimes and adopted Beiyang symbols to boost their legitimacy. Note the similarity in flags, for example: Beiyang: Manchukuo: Mengjiang: So no, no Chinese warlord used Beiyang symbols after 1928; only Japanese puppet regimes did. 

During the 13th century, the Yuan empire made two invasion attempts at Japan, in the battles of Bun'ei and Kōan. In both cases, the samurai defenders fought the Mongols off their beachheads, and the bulk of the invaders were defeated due to storms. However, I've noticed that the descriptions of both invasions do not mention any Japanese navy or naval engagements. In both cases, the invaders quickly took the neighboring Iki and Tsushima islands, only encountering resistance once they've landed in Kyushu, where the samurai forces were gathered. Did Japan simply have no navy to speak of during this time, or was it determined that they had no hope of fighting the large Mongol navy on the seas?
