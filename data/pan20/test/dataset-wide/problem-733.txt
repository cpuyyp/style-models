you can clean the chain without release it, use chain cleaner for it, you can rotate your crank and clean the chain. You will damage the pin if you release it everytime you clean the chain... 

What's the size of ball bearing on WH-R550 hub, is it 1/4" for the front one and rear one ? Can I replace them with 1/4" ceramic bearing ? Thanks 

Should I use spacer on CS-7800 who is being installed on WH-7900 ? Or just install the cassete without 0.5mm spacer ? Cheers and thank you.. 

Try put your seatpost / saddle on the vise ( reverse the bike ) then rotate the frame for pulling out the seatpost, put WD-40 or other lubricant for before you do it.... 

Do you know how to match a color on the frame ? I want to buy a paint from a tool shop but I'm not sure if it's match with the frame color. I'm going to use the paint for a touch up. Thanks for the info. 

I have a question about hub, When should I grease my hub ? every 20000 km ? How do I know it needs new grease ? Because I can not see if the grease is dry or not...? Thanks 

What's the cone spanner size for cone nut on Shimano WH-R550 Front wheel ? Is it 17mm or 18mm ? I tried with 16, it seems, need more, 1 or 2mm bigger. Thanks 

If you like to visit very steep climb, I suggest using 50/34 for chainring and 12/27 10 speed 12,13,14,15,16,17,19,21,24,27 for your sprocket, or 11-28 includes - 11,12,13,14,15,17,19,21,24,28 27 or 28 is very usefull if you climb more than 25% grade... But if you have a strong power output 53/39 chainring with 12-25 includes - 12,13,14,15,16,17,19,21,23,25 should be sufficient... I did 20% with 39/25....so every one is unique for this sprocket/chainring selection, depends on your leg :) 

I saw at ebay, 10 speed cassette compatible with shimano, it's very light 103 grams, but the material is alloy with ceramic coated, it says, the cassette can be used up to 3000K, is it true? or may be more than 3000K, because if it's 3000K the age for me is only about 3 months or less riding. Have any of you ever used one ? Thanks 

My head is spinning with confusion on BB terminology, I'm hoping somebody can clarify things. I'm interested in building a road bike with the Dengfu FM098 frame and an Ultegra groupset that I would like to purchase from Chain Reaction Cycles. The frame is here: $URL$ And from Chain Reaction the Ultegra groupset can be purchased here with some options: $URL$ or here with pretty much every conceivable option: $URL$ So here is where the confusion begins. The Dengfu link above lists the FM098 Bottom Bracket as "BB: English BB/BB30", I'm under the impression that this means a choice of an "English BB" or a "BB30" bottom bracket, is this correct? Now considering the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset links, the one with fewer options does not list an option for BB, rather it states "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA". The Ultegra Groupset builder with the many options has 2 choices for BB after choosing the Shimano Ultegra 6800 Bottom Bracket option, "English 68mm" or "Italian 70mm" So I checked the Wikipedia page for BBs: $URL$ The table towards the bottom (see the column heading "Bottom Bracket Thread Name") seems to imply that ISO/English & BSC (British Standard Cycle) and BSA all effectively mean the same thing, and that the shell with for these is 68mm. At this point I'm under the impression that the Denfgu "BB: English BB/BB30" means a choice of an English Bottom Bracket or a BB30 Bottom Bracket. I'm also under the impression that the Chain Reaction Cycles Ultegra Groupset with "Incl. Hollowtech II Bottom Bracket SM-BBR60 BSA" would match the Dengfu frame with the English BB option, since BSA seems to mean the same thing as English, and English seems to be 68mm, is this correct? If not, would the Chain Reaction Ultegra Groupset Builder with the "English 68mm" option fit the Dengfu FM098 frame with the "English BB" option (supposing this is actually a separate option from the "BB30" on the Dengfu FM098)? Sorry if this is a beginner question but BB terminology can be quite confusing! 

I'm interested in using BSA crank parts with a certain BB30 frame and I'm a little unclear about cable routing, I'm hoping somebody here can help clarify the confusion. I'm considering purchasing a Dengfu FM286: $URL$ The concern is that I'm going to use a BSA crank parts and they only have a BB30 frame available in my size (3 month wait for BSA version in the proper size). I'm under the impression that frames with internal cable routing can allow the cables to pass the BB area in one of two ways, either through the BB opening, or underneath on the bottom of the frame in tubes, is this correct? For the typical BB30 to BSA adapters, for example: $URL$ $URL$ I'm under the impression that these could be used on a frame where the cables route in tubes underneath the frame, but could not be used in a frame where cables route through the BB opening, correct? If so, here is the further confusion on my part. I emailed Dengfu pertaining to the frame linked above, and received this response: "I show you pictures of BSA adapter and BB30 frame bottom. You can install cables internally." Here are the pics they sent: 

Let me tell you from experience what doesn't work: Putting a cell phone in a the pocket of a "waterproof" jacket. I lost a phone that way, and another one saw the light at the end of a foggy, damp tunnel before returning back to life. If you are able to, turn gadgets you are carrying off. Having electricity flow through the system just increases the possibility of problems. For extra paranoia, remove the batteries. My rule of thumb is that any important electric should be "double waterproofed". Usually this is accomplished with a plastic bag (not necessarily anything special), inside a supposedly-waterproof pannier. A small "dry bag" would be durable, waterproof choice for small electronics. For touring, I looked for and found extra thick and tough garbage bags to use as an inner liner for my panniers. These are far less likely to be punctured than garden-variety plastic bags. Again, nothing special-- just a grocery store product. In a pinch, use two plastic grocery bags, applied around the electrics in opposite directions. If the gear does manage to get wet despite your best efforts, let it dry out thoroughly before turning it back on. 

keeping your feet warm while winter bike commuting For keeping your feet warm, I recommend NEOS overshoes. They go over your normal shoes, keeping your shoes and pant legs dry and clean. Even the non-insulated options add warmth due to the layering. I like the Voyager model, which is also light and packable. Keeping your hands warm while winter bike commuting If putting your hands someplace warm doesn't work well enough, you can try a little cayenne to improve your circulation. A small amount can go in your gloves (or socks!) It has worked for me. This worked for my son: 

I regularly ride a 1971 Raleigh Twenty with a Sturmey Archer 3-speed hub. I do not maintenance the hub, and it continues to work fine, 40 years later. (Although I presume there were some years before I bought it a few years ago in which it wasn't ridden). I have also regularly ridden a Shimano Nexus 8 hub for the past 4 years, year-round in snow and rain in Indiana. I don't recall doing any maintenance on it yet, either. UPDATE: After about 5 years of regular use without maintenance the Shimano Nexus 8 hub eventually failed. Had I oiled and maintenanced it a bit, I presume it would have lasted longer. 

So I'm left with some questions: -For the adapter (1st pic), is this a BB30 to BSA adapter with pre-machined holes? It appears to be but I'm not sure -For the frame (2nd pic), does that appear to be a BB30 frame? I would suspect so since there don't appear to be BB threads but I'm not sure. -Also for the frame, are those two tubes on the bottom of the frame (they appear to be gold colored in the pic, but that's probably just the lighting, I would suspect they are actually white) where the cables route through? If so, does that mean any BB30 to BSA adapter could be pressed in and still allow the cable routing, or is it still necessary to utilize the BB hole in some way? I will contact the company further about this, but I'm also interested in the expertise of anybody in this forum that can offer information about BB30 to BSA conversion for an internally routed cable frame, and also your impressions of the images above. Please advise, thanks! 

Scrolling down further under the "Description" section the following additional information is found: 

I'm under the impression that "O.L.D." = Over-Lock-nut Distance, i.e. the width of the axle between the threads, which should correspond to the distance between the inside of the drop-outs on the frame. I'm trying to figure out what the drop-down options mean and which is the correct choice in my case. Here's my best guess as to an expanded explanation of the options in the drop-down (also using the information from the description section): "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a traditional quick release (100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 135mm QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a traditional quick release (135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "15mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (15 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 142x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 142 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes "12mm / 135x12mm for Shimano/Sram 10,11s +$10" means: front axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 100 mm wide), rear axle is a thru-axle (12 mm diameter, 135 mm wide), compatible with Shimano or Sram 10 or 11 speed cassettes, at $10 additional cost Is my understanding correct? Returning to my specific situation, I'd like to stick with traditional quick-release skewers at both the front and rear, and I used an 11 speed Shimano Ultegra rear derailleur with the FM286 build. So, considering all of the above, I'm under the impression that the correct choice in my case would be the first axle option in the drop-down, "QR / QR for Shimano/Sram 10,11s", correct? Can anybody confirm my understanding of the above? If I'm incorrect in my interpretation anywhere, please clarify, thanks!
