[1] The broken throne may hint at the story of the succession of David by Solomon, his son with Bathsheba, rather than by primogeniture of his eldest son. 

No. Shakespeare wrote a fair bit of prose as well, especially later in his career. Henry VI part 1 is entirely in verse. Tempest mixes verse and prose. Often, verse indicates the "high" plot line (the rich people) and prose indicates the "low" plot line (poor people). In Twelfth Night, Viola often (though not always) speaks in poetry to Olivia: 

Iago isn't entirely consistent in his motivations. He also blames Othello for sleeping with his wife, something he says in soliloquy, which is usually treated as truthful. Iago's primary mention of a motivation against Cassio is in a speech to Roderigo, to whom he lies on more than one occasion. Iago's motives are famously unclear. Which is to say that Othello may simply not have noticed them. People are passed over for promotion all the time without turning to complex, Rube Goldbergian revenge plots. Iago acts as Othello's friend, and Othello may simply believe that Iago is a good soldier who accepts the chain of command. Othello may even believe that Iago is motivated to show good discipline in order to receive promotion next time. That said, Othello is remarkably obtuse. Iago is aided by a series of coincidences. He had absolutely no reason to hope that Cassio might engage in an entire scene about his love for Bianca without once mentioning her name, which would have spoiled the whole plan. There are many ways for an actor and director to resolve that tension. But I would say that most of them will revolve around Othello's genuine compassion for Iago, and Iago's remarkable skill in convincing Othello that the friendship is returned. That, and simple disbelief that Iago would engage in so convoluted a plot. 

It appears to be the one in Massachusetts. The essay is frequently cited as being published in Wheaton College alumnae magazine, which is the magazine of the Wheaton College in Massachusetts. I note, however, that the library's own history page does not make any mention of a rededication in 1973. There was a renaming of a room after a key alumna in 1972. 

"There is only one catch" refers to that particular situation. The previous lines describe a character Orr, who should be grounded (prevented from flying). Which he's entitled to be, on the grounds that it would be crazy to continue flying. All he has to do is ask... but that would imply that he was sane, and thus sane enough to fly. "Catch-22" is the name of that particular catch, the self-defeating one. There are presumably others: the book presents the Army as a complicated, rule-bound, infuriating place, full of many catches. But this one's a doozy. The numbering of "catches" hints at a bureaucracy. It implies that there are more of them out there, though we're never introduced to them. They may have numbers like 21 and 23... or not. The next one could well be 43,384. (Take a look at military unit numbers and see if you can find a pattern.) They could be lettered, or named, or even just completely undesignated. But they're certainly out there. Probably. You almost certainly can't get a list of them... but the number hints that maybe you could, if you just knew how. If you knew how, of course, you wouldn't need the list. 

If it's funny to trick the man, it's even funnier to trick him with a boy. Shakespeare used the man-in-a-dress to comedic effect elsewhere, most notably Thisby. It makes a man look small and weak, and thus comic in the Aristotelian sense: 

The Folger edition identifies the Watchman lines with various characters, including First and Second Watch, and George Seacoal (whose name is mentioned but not listed in the dramatis personae). It's an editorial decision based on their analysis of the style and subject of each line. The lines are identified just as "Watch" in the First Folio. I'd say it's not so much about Shakespeare's attention to minor characters as the sloppiness of the original editing. The First Folio was assembled from a variety of not-entirely-reliable (and probably not-entirely-legible) sources. The original performances presumably had definitive answers to these questions, with the author present, but that would be lost over the next couple of decades before the Folio was prepared. (There was a Quarto edition much earlier which was likely used as a key source for the Folio.) You can take the Folger editors' word for their decisions, or make your own. Since the play identifies two watchmen by name (Seacole and Oatcake), who are different from the First Watchman (who speaks those names), you've got flexibility to determine for yourself who is who. I don't believe that a close reading would support giving all Watchman lines to be First Watchman, though I haven't done that analysis. (I note that the Folger edition takes one line labeled as Watch 2 and assigns it to Seacole, then gives a different Watch line to Second Watchman. So... yeah.) 

Silver does double duty here, both as the color of the box, and as the surface of a mirror. The box warned that “Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”. His desert is a "portrait of a blinking idiot". The box suggests that he should kiss it ("Some there be that shadows kiss"), as a narcissist kissing their own image in a mirror. And that's the only kissing he'll be getting today. There is a third image of silver a few lines down: 

Shakespeare wrote iambic pentameter because that was the most common verse meter of the time. He didn't establish it. Edmund Spenser used it in The Faerie Queene: 

Corey Olsen discusses this a bit in his lecture series at Mythgard. (I strongly recommend it: he's quite gifted at close analysis, plus it's free.) He notes that most people compare it to Jane Austen, since that's the Regency author that most people are familiar with. It does fit her style well, but that of many other Georgian authors as well. In sum, he considers it an amalgam of various common tropes, rather than a direct stylistic copy of any particular author. 

Orwell's original essay is primarily about Rudyard Kipling, and I don't believe he ever worked out a full theory of "good bad poetry". He cites other examples: 

Collectively, the stories are called the Epic Cycle. They tell the whole story of the Trojan War, from the Judgment of Paris to the death of Odysseus. It includes the Iliad and the Odyssey (though the term "Epic Cycle" is often used just to refer to non-Homeric books). Like those two, the Epic Cycle is based on older, oral stories, possibly dating back as far as the original events. Their authors are unknown, just as the tradition of Homer's authorship is doubtful. They are assumed to have been written around the same time as the Iliad and Odyssey, plus or minus a century or so. Unfortunately, most of these books are lost. We know them from other tellings of the myths. We know their stories from critical analysis of them in other books, including Aristotle. Occasionally these include fragments of a few lines, but the books are effectively gone. The stories were well known by then, and many authors told them: Ovid, Pausanias, Lucian, etc. The story of the Trojan Horse is best known from Quintus of Smyrna. Like other myths, authors felt free to tell and re-tell the stories, adding details that eventually became "canon". They may or may not have known the versions in the Epic Cycle.
