If they don't need to eat, drink or sleep what motivation do they have? Most of our technology was created to help achieve one of the three. It sounds like they should have basically no technology, no curiosity, no drive for exploration. Since none of these give them an evolutionary benefit, unlike humans who need to seek out new resources and thus are greatly aided by all three. Your creatures may be powerful but they are also stagnant, with little ability to adapt or change. So they are great warriors and absolute crap at everything else. I doubt they would even use tools. 

first lets deal with what happens without the helmet. No temprature is not a factor there is not enough time for it to matter. According to NASA studies using dogs and chimpanzees after about 15 seconds the body will begin to bloat as if the the entire body is swelling up after an injury (really your fluids are cold boiling), this continues until they look more like a human balloon,and quickly limits movement. they will also poop, vomit, and piss themselves due to the gas pressure in the bowels, this material has a tendency to freeze on the outside of the body. Primates survived for several minutes, regaining full function within hours if pressurized, but lost consciousness within 11 seconds. Now what the helmet does. Helmet with seal and air supply The helmet may be more problem than advantage, if the helmet is continuing to add pressure to the body, trying to reach equilibrium, it will keep inflating the body until something gives. before then the pressure rise in the throat will cut off circulation to the brain and you will loose consciousness ins around 15-30 seconds. (it takes 10-11 seconds without the helmet) So at least you will not be conscious when you eventually pop. Of course the only way the helmet could be sealed is if it was sealed to the neck so tightly it would actually cut off circulation on its own in which cases you have strangulation and nothing to do with space. Normal flight helmet If the helmet is like a normal flight helmet however there is no good seal, so gasses will just escape around the edges giving a best a few more seconds of consciousness (~15 seconds total) as it did with Jim LeBlanc when his suit ruptured. They will suffocate. This is actually the best option if prolonged consciousness is your goal. Source dogs Source chimps 

History and anthropology will be paramount. They would not be the first civilization to collapse, and will likely not be the last. History can show you how problems were solved without current tech, the history of technology is basically half of a "how to rebuild civilization" guide. The other half being history of culture and philosophy. Even recent (for us) history will be helpful, like how the cavendish banana went extinct becasue they were all clones and one disease wiped them out. history can introduce a very wide range of subjects very quickly. Paleontology AKA the history of life would be nice addition, they will deal with concepts of deep time, long reaching consequences, accumulation of collective action, and complex interactions which will be important. Finding out oxygen was a deadly waste produced in minute quantities by oceans full of bacteria that nearly caused the extinction of all life is good for reminding people small actions by lots of people can have huge cumulative effects. It is also a nice lesson since they nearly drove themselves to extinction. Evolutionary psychology will be nice as well, why humans do some of the weird self-destructive things we do will help understand what happened and how to avoid it, and possibly even how to change it. Keep in mind motivation will be a real issue for survivors since their wants and needs will be met, and humans can be breathtakingly lazy under these conditions. Long time scale thinking skills, debate, and exploration will help combat this. Maker and artistic skills, as strange as it sounds this will be very important. The desire to build and create thing for the sheer pleasure of it will go a long way to keeping people motivated and to keep them human and creative. This also teaches the single biggest skill set they will need, problem solving skills. It is also a good way to combat depression which will be rampant. Plus all the theoretical knowledge in the world will not help if you don't know how to put it in practice, your people need lots of practice in building and creating. 

Will they have prejudice, yes, that is inevitable, the brain literally can't handle the myriad of facets that make up other people so it has to simplify, being X means this, being Y means that, If X then A,B,C. we need to be able to group people based on characteristics in order to predict behavior. do those devision need to be along "race" or physical characteristics, No* it appears that what we divide people on is whatever is both easy and perceived as reliable. if you repeatedly tell someone X=Y people tend to believe it, esspecially if you tell them as children. We could create a culture based of sterotyping based on other characteristics. instead of Dave is black therefore also X, Y,and Z, it could be Dave is a Labor Party therefore... Or Dave is an accountant therefore... Or even Dave wears plaid therefore... most of us don't predict people's behavior by hair color becasue there is no perceived reliability to doing so. The reason we do by race in modern societies is becasue of a combination of historical baggage and the fact that it is kinda reliable for some things in modern society due to ghettoization, national history & language, and cultural identity. ( example: if you meet a large blonde man in kilt you would not expect him to speak with a jamaican accent, becasue you're brain is making predictions about his past based on his appearance and it doesn't match the generalization of Jamaican, and that would be a fairly accurate prediction based on living right now anywhere except perhaps on jamaica. We have been taught, often accidentally, to associate certain things with "race" so we do. We wouldn't if we had not been repeatedly shown these things together, if we had not been give reason to think of races as reliable means of grouping and thus prediction . For example most cultures don't predict behavior based on height or hair color even though it is easy to identify, becasue we we never taught to associate those things with anything else. The hard part is colonizing a world without bringing the cultural baggage with you, but if you can think of a way around that they no racism is not automatically going to happen, at least as long as your new world doesn't break up into individual nations. *(other than minor ones like Tim is short so Tim can't reach thing on high shelves, or Bob has the complexion of fresh snow so Bob probably doesn't spend much time outside.) 

Radio is possible at least hypothetically, the simplest types of radio, crystal radio are structurally simple and don't need power to receive and there are animals that incorporate crystals into their tissue. it's a stretch but not an impossible one. Would really mess with a human observer too it would look a lot like telepathy. MIT cas produced radio reactive biological molecules so you know it is at least possible. pulses of light are another option, basically think morse code with bioluminosity, there are plenty of deep sea organisms that can emit light in patterns. a side benefit is light can be focused much easier than sound so they might not have problems with people overhearing their conversation. Smell is possible but unlikely, it's just too slow and limited for complex conversation. Journeyman mentioned squid aka cuttlefish can use color and pattern, and can even say one thing with the left and another with the right side. I couls easily see this evolving in to full blown conversation. 

salamander-people or crabs the hardest part is getting a water breather that can also build on land. Nothing intelligent fits the bill, so what does fit the bill: walking bottom dweller or something with a staged life cycle. Crabs can come out on land for extended periods and have grasping appendages, exoskeleton is size limiting however so they should be dog sized at best. And they won't end up looking much like crabs. Some amphibian like certain salamanders start out as aquatic but gain more and more terrestrial features as they develop. You could push this to the extreme and have a organism that is aquatic but becomes semi aquatic when it reaches sexual maturity. If their prematurity part of their life cycle is long you would have a creature that builds most of its civilization under water but the older ones can venture out onto land. There are extinct scaly amphibians that fit the bill. But you have a lot of flexibility with this approach and can create your creature to suit your needs. I always liked the idea of a elongate six limbed scaly amphibians where the first two limbs function for grasping and the second set function for both grasping and locomotion. I used that as DM. 

Hot springs. The romans kinda invented the idea of the vacation so having something like a hot spring will draw wealthy travelers, even the medieval people recognized the benefits of a hot soak on aches and pains. the mountain setting is perfect for such a spring. If the site is blessed at anypoint or connected to a historical figure it will draw even more as a pilgrimage site. This is where Sir/Saint _____ rested before/after his famous ______. of course a steady flow of money will draw merchants. 

The only real issue is you want placid animals, like common livestock and not pets. After that it is entirely up to you, based on the vampires food preferences the only thing that will really change from animal to animal is volume of blood you can remove. We have had ways of immobilizing animals for centuries, and attaching things to them for decades, once infection is no longer an issue the sky is the limit. We have cows that you can open up valve the side of and stick your hand in their stomach, keeping a collar in place is not an problem. We already have ways of harvesting animal blood for hormones and antigens anyway. A placement on the body or neck will work fine. Here is a medical breakdown of methods and animal selection criteria, just to warn you it is automatic download.
