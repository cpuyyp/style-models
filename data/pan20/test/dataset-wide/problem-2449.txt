Yes, the Mettanisamsa Sutta lists eleven benefits of Metta meditation, out of which ten can be experienced in this life. The ninth one is the one related to this question: "His/her countenance is serene" Also read the Culla-kamma vibhanga sutta 

Did you not prevent it because mice are usually an annoyance and 1 less mouse makes your life better? If so, it's bad Karma. Later you may make up an excuse like "not wanting to interfere with nature". But what matters is the intention at the time. If you were wishing for the mouse to escape, it is good Karma. If you actually saved the mouse, it's more good Karma. If you were neutral based on Upekkha(contemplating on Karma and Vipaka), it's good Karma. If you were neutral based on indifference born of ignorance, it is bad Karma. 

So if someone claims that 'God' is something other than a sensation or an idea(that simply arises and ceases), if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. 

An Arahant reveres the Buddha and his teaching not because he/she has anything left to attain, but because the Buddha and the Dhamma are what led him/her to Nibbana. The faculty of faith peaks out when a being attains Arahantship. The closer you get to Nibbana, the more respect and appreciation you will have for the Buddha and his teachings. Incidentally, venerable Sariputta attained Arahantship by listening to the Dīghanakha (or Vedanāpariggaha) Sutta at the Sūkarakhata cave. 

Teach and practice the Dhamma and encourage others to practice as well, just like how the Ariya-sangha would do. 

There's no real starting point. But if you are asking the origin of earth and how it's populated, how we came here etc. you can read the Agganna sutta. We basically came from a Brahma realm called Abhassara. We were luminous beings. Not at all like monkeys. Only after a long time we changed into this monkey like form because of our behavior and what we consumed. 

Think of the brain as a proxy server connecting you to the internet(all past life memories). Just because your browser can only see the proxy server, is it wise to assume that the whole internet is contained in the proxy server? Think of the as the information stored in the cache memory of the proxy server. If somebody alters or adds new content to the cache memory, it will be shown on your browser. Then is it wise to assume that the whole internet is just electrical traces stored in the cache memory of the proxy server? The brain is simply a tool used by the mind. Mind doesn't cease to exist even if the tool breaks. 

Khandha Māra - The five aggregates of clinging Kilesa Māra - The defilements Abhisankhāra Māra - The Karmic force Maccu Māra - The death itself Devaputta Māra - The god Mara who leads a faction in the Paranimmita-Vasavatti heaven. 

That's like asking how long would it take for you to start tasting the curries that are already on your plate. Or like asking how long will it take for you to taste almonds and cashews when you are eating a mix of nuts. It's just a matter of you deciding to practice awareness on them. Cittanupassana When your mind wanders thinking about past/present/future or when your mind becomes concentrated/scattered, you can be mindful of it to practice the 3rd Satipattana Dhammanupassana If you decide to practice mindfulness on seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting etc. or the five hindrances, that's the 4th Satipattana. 

Request for a Kammatthana Kammatthanachari Bhikku studies your traits and makes a guess of a suitable Kammatthana for you. you practice the Kammatthana for a while and reports back to your Kammatthanaachaari Bhikku on your progress/difficulties. Alteration of the Kammatthana if required. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you have found the Kammatthana which is best for you. 

Until we stop, look back and see what we have collected, what we have tried to make ours, and all the sadness, sorrow and disappointment it has brought us, we are blind to the fact that happiness has always eluded us. Why oh why? Happiness has eluded us because we have failed to see the world as is. We cannot bend to world to our will. We cannot change it to suit our need. Even if we did, it will be for a limited time. When the world is not the way we want it (Anichcha) it brings us sadness, anger and disappointment. When the world works according to our will, it brings us happiness and joy. Both these ends are the effects of failing to see the world as is. To see the world as is, one needs to start seeing beyond the attachments (Lobha, Dwesha) the effects of Moha (not seeing the reality). Search for the reason why you are happy or sad. How did your mind give birth to that feeling? Before this feeling overwhelmed you, what did you feel? how did your mind translate from that state to this? You will find that a value you have given as good/bad to something. Take that value and look for the reason as to why did you value it as good or bad. Haven't you tried to change to world? bend it to your will and failed/succeeded? (most of the time we forget to look at the moments we consider as 'happy' ones). Things happen in the world around us. We do not have absolute control over them. That is how the world works. So, why are you trying to change it and feel sad when it didn't or feel happy when it does for a little while? 

Looking at whatever sorrowful or joyful things in life and being stuck over those feelings is not seeing things as they are. That is Moha, which would lead to Lobha or Dwesha. Remember: seeing things as they are is the effect (not the cause) of learning and practicing Dhamma. Which means seeing things as they are is part of the end result you are striving to achieve. It is at the destination of your journey. To reach that destination you have to make the journey. For an example, you want to visit the Himalayan peak. You have to prepare yourself for the journey and actually make the journey before you can stand on the peak and admire the view. Alternatively, you can stand anywhere and imagine that you are on the Himalayan Peak. But, no matter how much you imagine, you are not really there unless you take the trouble of actually making the journey yourself. How can I get there? Learning Buddhism is like learning physics. Yes, the physics of the mind. Buddhism teaches us how the minds works and how it behaves. What are the perils of Sankhara and Wigngnaana (the illusion), and how it enslaves us through either making us attach to things/feelings (Lobha) and/or how it makes us fight with those we deem as threats/not good for us. Things happen in the world that we live in. Sometimes they are affected by our actions, and some of them affects us. We evaluate them based on our bias, practices, perceptions and rate them as Good-for-me (Lobha), or Bad-for-me (Dwesha), or it-does-not affect me. If it's deemed as good, then we chase it, with the hope of 'making-them-mine'. Striving to obtain/achieve it. If its deemed as bad, then we take the effort to desist from it, destroy it. Both of those are attachments. The more we attach ourselves to, the burden is on ourselves. Sadly most of us do not see it. I would like to quote a beautiful simile from the movie 'Up In the Air'. The dialogue is as follows: 

Nibbana is being blown out. So once you die for a person who has attained Nibbana does not go any where. The person is extinguished. This is like when you blow out the candle the flame does not go any where. The conditions for combustion are not there hence it extinguishers. This is similar to Nirvana. Conditions for future rebirths are no longer present hence you get extinguished. 

When you get such an experience try to see the arising and passing nature of it! This experience, as with any other experience, in essential you your practice of equanimity. Whatever your experience be equanimous - this is the exercise and what you should be doing. 

Pleasant bodily feeling Pleasant mental feeling Unpleasant bodily feeling Unpleasant mental feeling Neutral feeling 

You can do this also. There is always a sensation associated with the hindrances. If you are angry you get a burning sensation. If you have sloth or torpor you feel heavy. 

You should have confidence and gratitude towards the Buddha. If this becomes a strong attachment this will hinder your progress on the path. The story of Vakkali is a good example. If you are dealing with Buddhism as a phylosophy then you are dealing with matters at a conceptual level. This is feeding into your perception than helping towards the cessation of perception. 

Well as mentioned above it is not self. If I am to rephrase this as what good is realisting not self. I-making leads to craving and future misery due to conditioning. 

You lose your ability to speak once you do not have Vitakka and Vicara. Hence this looks fishy to be from a traditional perspective. 

unchanging everlasting component which we can identify as self. Other contemporary teachers tried to identify such a part which they called Atman there is nothing to which any one can have absolute or ever lasting control over either externally or internally 

Interpreting virtue as "behavior showing high moral standards". The person with the attainments would be more virtus / morale, as monk without attainment may transgress the moral code which they live by (even any or the lay percents - some overlap with disrobing offences here also) but an attained person will have only a lesser chance of doing so depending on the level of attainment. (5 precepts being automatic from the 1st stage of sainthood. As more fetters drop more moral you become.) With regard to respect lay people should have towards either of them, the monk should come foremost, as 

Hinduism had these aspects but Buddhism is completely different. A lot of things which are at the core of Hinduism was rejected by the Buddha. He accepted what was true. Leave aside that may not be logical for the time being and pratice until you have verified facts through your experience. Experiencing the teaching will reinforce your belief. 

Discerning the in and out breathing Discerning long or short breaths Experiencing the whole body (sabbakāaya) Calming bodily formations 

As long as you do not make claim of function being non fiction then you are OK. For something to be a lie the following conditions must be fulfilled. 

Ignorance is not seeing things as they are due to clouding by our perception, views, unskilled nature scattered nature of our mind. In relation to unsatisfactory nature of existence, it is not seeing the 3 marks of existence, the 4 noble truths and dependent origination. Delusion can be the perception and view itself. 

Mahā,nidāna Sutta So basis of morality is also linked to feelings. This is what needs to be done when being mindful in day to day activities. You do not have to go through all this. Just see this is a pleasant feeling which is the basis of attachment to arise, this is a unpleasant feeling which is the basis of aversion to arise, this is a neutral feeling which is the basis for ignorance to arise. As soon as feeling arise stop the train of event so you do not mentally proliferate, does not result in clinging and craving, does not provide nutriment, does not lead to unwholesome roots, does not lead to immoral actions, does not lead to unwholesome karma, etc. So be equanimous thus not letting the aversion and craving to arise and contemplate impermanence or the 3 characteristics not letting ignorance to arise. Displacing ignorance also helps break the cycle of DO. Generally being aware and mindful is good but is not Wise Attention (Yoniso Manasikara), Clear Comprehension (Sampajañña ) and Right Mindfulness. If you are a surgeon, acrobat, bellarian, gymnast, etc. you will need a lot of attention and mindfulness. This will wear you down. Perhaps this is what is happening in your practice. What you need is the right type, i.e.:
