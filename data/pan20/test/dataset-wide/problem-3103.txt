It's often stated (perhaps correctly) that Davy Crockett perished while defending the Alamo in Texas during the revolution against the Mexicans. Many legends about this hero of the West, however, say otherwise and state that Crockett escaped from the Alamo somehow and lived out his days performing feats on the Great Plains. Of course it's almost universally accepted that Davy Crockett lost his life gloriously defending the Alamo, but I'm wondering whether there's any hard, physical, historical records of witnessing his death at the Alamo. Basically, my question is, could someone give me the most reliable HISTORICAL (like, the 1830's) records of Crockett's death at the Alamo? 

What were the reasons that the U.S. government selected Hiroshima to be the city in Japan on which the first atomic bomb was dropped, other than the obvious reason that Hiroshima was a large, important port of Japan? What I mean is, what set Hiroshima, and, later, Nagasaki, apart from other important Japanese cities, making these two cities those selected for the atom bomb? Could the reason have something to do with the city's location (near the coast in southern Japan); their industries; or some other factor, such as, perhaps, the location of important government offices there? Although I did extensive research on this subject, the only reason I found for this was that, on the morning scheduled for the bombing, Hiroshima had no cloud cover, letting the bomber Enola Gay aim the bomb carefully. However, this is a short-term reason, and I'm looking for longer-term reasons. 

Beginning in 1520, right after Martin Luther's Reformation, bloody religious wars began that kept recurring almost yearly for over a century. The Reformation's rapid spread drew battle lines accross Europe as Catholic armies were fielded to crush the Protestants into submission, engulfing the continent in intermittent war from the 1520s to the 1640s. But what was the real cause of these recurring wars? In other words, "Why not live and let live?" 

In Russia in 1917 and 1918, a number of important events, including the abdication and assassination of Czar Nicholas, and the Menshevik and Bolshevik revolutions occurred while the Old Style (Julian) calendar was in use. But within a few months of these events, the New Style (Gregorian) calendar was adopted in Soviet Russia. Do the Russians mark the anniversaries of these events by the Julian Calendar, in which they occurred, or in the Gregorian Calendar? For instance, is the abdication of the Tsar considered to have occurred on March 2 or March 15? 

If the Ch’in dynasty was so short-lived, why was China named for it? The Ch’in Dynasty, which lasted for only 39 years, was China’s shortest-lived dynasty. (Compare that to the Shang’s 750 years, Chou’s 900 years, and Han’s 400+ years.) But China was named for this seemingly minor dynasty. Why? 

In the early months of World War II, the United Stated spent several millions of dollars to fortify the West Coast against possible Japanese attack, going as far as to stretch a gigantic submarine net across the Juan de Fuca Strait and to cover the entire Boeing plant in Seattle with camouflaging wire net to make it look like a residential suburb. Yet all these numerous fears of Japanese attack never materialized. Aside from sending a couple thousand bomb-filled balloons across the Pacific (all of which fell on sparsely inhabited areas), Japan never even touched the West Coast of America. Why didn’t the Japanese attempt even a single attack on the mainland? What deterred them from striking such a direct blow on America? A submarine attack would have been easy for them, but they never sent a known submarine beyond the territorial waters of Hawaii. So what’s the story here? Or were there attacks I simply didn’t come across in all my sources about World War II? 

In the beginning of the Middle Ages, silk in Europe was known only as the expensive fabric imported from Asia. But by the end of The Middle Ages, silk had become one of Europe's major industries. How did this change occur? 

The Mongol Empire rapidly expanded to become the largest land empire in history, but then it disintegrated just as rapidly. What caused this so rapid demise of the world's largest pre-British Empire? 

Many historians, such as Massie, mention that Lenin may have abruptly become ill in 1922, and died two years later, because he was poisoned. However, nobody ever mentions why this is thought, who may have done it, or what poison was used. Could someone explain what evidence is used to support the theory of Lenin's death by poisoning? 

A vast, isolated area was needed to produce plutonium because no one knew for sure how much damage the radiation it gave off might do. Abundant power for plutonium production and water to cool the heat that built up were also needed. What seemed like an ideal location existed in a barren corner of Benton County in Central Washington. Hanford was isolated—the nearest large own was Yakima, a hundred miles away. Although the land was desert, the climate was fairly mild. The Columbia River, an abundant source of water for cooling reactors, flowed through the village. (This was why even more isolated areas, such as New Mexico, were not chosen for the plutonium reactor—no water for cooling was nearby.) Also, the Grand Coulee Dam was producing abundant power nearby. And, of course, it would be easy to build a factory town here because of the smooth land—certainly not a deciding factor in the selection of Hanford, but nevertheless gratefully acknowledged by the U.S. Army engineers who were called upon to build thousands of barracks posthaste. By the way, the actual reactor was constructed several miles north of Hanford—not right inside town, as the question implies. 

In 1816, temperatures dipped so low that in North America snow fell in the middle of August and in Europe waterways remained frozen until midsummer. What was the reason for this incredible dip in temperature? 

Fully thirteen years passed after the Declaration of Independence before George Washington became President—first under Congress, then under the Articles of Confederation. It's a famous trivia fact that John Hancock was “president of the United States” before George Washington, but surely he couldn’t have been that for thirteen years. WHO were the other chief executives (presidents of Congress) of the United States between the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and what was their legal status? 

The answer to this is more geological than historical or meteorological; the reason for 1816's incredible cold was a massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia. As long before as 1783, Ben Franklin had suggested that volcanic eruptions may cause dips in temperature due to blocking out light from the Sun, and his ideas were brilliantly confirmed by Mother Nature in 1816 when the Indonesian Mount Tambora exploded. Mount Tambora's explosion ejected over 100 cubic kilometers of ash into the atmosphere, making the sky so hazy that all over the world, stars dipped by a full magnitude. This also meant the earth received (comparatively) much less light from the Sun than before, and due to that, temperatures dipped so low than 1816 became known as the "year without a summer". The 1883 eruption of Krakatau, the 1991 explosion of Pinatubo, and even Mount Saint Helens' 1980 eruption further proved this by noticeably lowering global temperatures, albeit or short periods of time and less severely than in 1816. 

After Charlemagne defeated the Christian Basques in Pamplona, why did he retreat through Roncevaux Pass (thereby setting himself up for ambush) instead of going on to conquer more of Iberia? 

By 1824, Spain had lost all of its mainland colonies in America. When the powers of Europe proposed to use the recently created Congress System to help Spain regain control of her lost American colonies, Great Britain balked. In addition to being sympathetic to the Latin American nations’ desire for independence, Great Britain had developed a thriving trade with them and had no desire to see them return to their status as Spanish colonies. In her support of continued Latin American independence, Britain was joined by the United States. In 1823, President James Monroe issued a statement which became known as the Monroe Doctrine, warning the European powers that intervention in Latin America would be looked upon by the United States as an unfriendly act.
