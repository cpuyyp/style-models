As others have pointed out, you can't spontaneously apply a new mutation to every virus (or whatever) at once. If one population of the virus evolves into a lethal strain, the new strain needs to start infecting the human population from scratch. But suppose that the original strain, while otherwise harmless, weakens the immune system in a specific way that prevents it from being recognized as a hostile body. This is beneficial in of itself, since it allows the virus to remain in a host indefinitely, and not harmful to the host as long as no other illness exists that takes advantage of the weakness. But suppose that after this original strain has infected the entire population, a new strain mutates in such a way that it becomes lethal after some incubation period. The lethal strain still needs to spread normally, but because everyone is already infected with the original strain, their immune systems have already been modified to ignore the new strain. If it's airborn, it'll spread extraordinarily quickly, even once it turns lethal and quarantine measures are put into effect. Presumably, there would be a few places that are isolated enough to keep the disease out, but most of the world would be helpless to stop it from infecting the majority of the population. 

You operate on whatever level of abstraction is predictable. Consider a historical analogy: Alchemists realized that you could combine different substances to get certain effects, and studied what combinations produced what effects. There was a fair amount of mysticism involved, but the good ones performed experiments and recorded the data that eventually allowed the development of... Chemistry broke down the molecules into their component elements and determined what properties caused certain elements to bond with others. A critical component in molecular bonds is the number of electrons in the outer orbital, and in turn the number of electrons that can exist in each orbital and the order in which they are filled. The observed patterns also allowed the construction of periodic tables in the 18th and 19th centuries that predicted the discovery of yet-undiscovered elements that would explain gaps in the patterns. Chemists could accurately state the nuclear and electron structure of each element, but couldn't explain why they worked that way until... Quantum Mechanics gave us the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in which the orbitals are explained as being due to the inability for two electrons to exist in both the same location and same quantized energy states. This is (to first approximation) the root cause of just about everything relating to molecular bonding, which is in turn the cause of chemical reactions. The Pauli Exclusion Principle was discovered in 1925. There are records of alchemical experiments going back as far as 300 BCE. At that point in time, the underlying principles were so far beyond the science of the time that they may as well have been magic. So they instead looked at higher and higher abstraction levels until they got to something they could reason about and make predictions about. You teach at that level, and perform research at a level just a little bit lower. 

The Moon is currently drifting away from Earth. The Earth is moving away from the Sun at 15cm/year. If the Moon were to somehow come closer to the earth through outside forces, then yes. Gravitational pull, if strong enough, will always pull two objects closer within a certain distance. (But currently, that is impossible.) If the Earth and the Moon were to collide, the results would depend on how fast the Moon was moving in relation to Earth, but it would be the difference between complete destruction, and complete destruction with a large fry. Earth's gravity is 9.8 meters/second (acceleration). The Moon's is 1.6 m/s. Force is equal to mass*acceleration. If you take the time to calculate that, you get a whole lot of pain for both involved. Technically gravity pulls from both objects, so you'd be looking at the mass of both the earth and the moon being pulled by the sum of both gravities... This is more force than in all the nuclear weapons on the planet, and then some. 

You certainly have a conundrum on your hands. Ultimately, you have a ruling class (those that control power) and various factions of a lower class. Like the current reality we live in, the lower class will be more numerous than the ruling class. When you consider what a weapon is, you come up with a simple answer... equality. A weapon is a tool that allows its user (or group of users) to kill the intended target while taking the importance off of the individual's (or group's) physical strength (to varying degrees). A weapon is needed when there is either a, an initiation of force against a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous target; or b, a defense against force initiated by a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous aggressor. This covers hunting, war, defense... basically any situation which could call for a weapon. Our current method of manufacturing our currently use weapons is both time and resource intensive. Our current stockpile WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. Without contemporary manufacturing of such weapons, there wouldn't be any reliably usable versions of modern weaponry. This ruling class you have obviously controls the means of production (they control the power) so they could feasibly control knowledge as well. If you include a way of passively defending themselves (using said power source as a shield around their island) which needs a unique device to bypass (identification pendants or some kind of genetic reader), and you have a reason why they wouldn't need weapons, and therefore would want to restrict their usage. All the lower class characters would need food, so it's safe to assume bows and arrows, spears, and other primitive weapons have resurged. Basically, you don't have weapons because the upper class is more secure without them than with them. 

First off, the question is somewhat meaningless. A society where such a lack of privacy is possible will not devolve into a zero-privacy society, but rather into a society where privacy becomes a luxury good. This also means that privacy would become asymmetric: ordinary people wouldn't have privacy, but elites would keep it (as would governments). In this scenario, trust would not be enhanced, but undermined. This happens because ordinary people have no reason to trust elites (who would still have privacy), and elites would fear that ordinary people might still eke out enough privacy to stage an uprising. By the way, this type of society is by no means utopian. That is one reason I arrived at the privacy-as-a-luxury-good. Privacy is a very recent invention to begin with. Privacy only started taking hold when people were able to build large enough houses or apartments to have rooms to retreat to. In many parts of the world, privacy has effectively been outlawed. The most obvious example is North Korea, but also in the Pilgrim's New England, there were laws that prohibited anybody from living alone; for singles, widowers or widows, etc., having roommates were mandatory "to prevent sin". Today's NSA/GCHQ is actually somewhat similar: they expect complete privacy for themselves (under threat of life in prison or even a death penalty), yet insist that nobody else be allowed to have privacy (even to the point where Britain's Cameron suggested outlawing encryption). The hypothetical society in the original question would suffer the same fate. Possessing these types of drones, or the 3-d printers that produce them, would likely be unavailable to ordinary people. They would likely be illegal, and since there is no privacy, it would also be impossible for ordinary people to illegally own them. So, no, a true zero-privacy society for everybody is not going to happen. Privacy-as-a-luxury-good would be the real outcome. 

It depends on how carefully controlled this approach is. If you can trust politicians not to do this to excess, then the effects may be manageable. However, there will always be some negative effect on faith in the currency system, because everybody who uses the currency will know in advance that it will lose value over time. 

It might be useful to turn the question around. Suppose you're a perfectly normal serial killer, and the cops are on to you. You want to convince them that you're actually part of a secret murderous cult, so you can try for a lesser sentence by turning yourself in and offering to inform on a few "fellow cultists". Maybe Alice and Bob from work; they're jerks, anyway. Now, regular murderers are a lot more common than the secret murderous cultist kind, so the cops aren't likely to believe you unless you come up with some really solid "evidence" to back up your story. Maybe you could break into Alice's and Bob's computers and forge some incriminating messages between them. (You think Eve might know the password.) But you really want physical evidence if you're going to convince anyone. So a better idea would be to grab some of the bloody knives in your garage, and possibly the kidney you took out of that one guy, and plant them at Alice's and Bob's houses. It'd be great if you could actually get a recording of them with one of the victims, but that's probably not doable unless you have time to kill another one before turning yourself in. Now all of those things that the hypothetical serial killer was going to use to "prove" that he was in a cult? Don't have those things in your cult. Don't discuss anything in writing except maybe in really vague terms. Properly dispose of all the bodies. Use regular kitchen knives for your sacrifices instead of fancy ceremonial ones, and wash them properly when you're done. (That's just a good idea anyway; you don't know where that sacrifice has been.) Don't videotape your ceremonies, and for that matter, don't let anyone bring their phones or anything else that can take pictures to the ceremonies in the first place. If the would be traitor can't provide actual evidence that the cult exists, all they'll accomplish by going to the authorities will be confessing to a murder and sounding like either a crazy person or a bad liar. 

I don't think that it is fundamentally possible because any habitable planet will have geologic activity as well as climate actions. Earth as a planet will remain habitable for a very long time, but no individual spot can be guaranteed to remain habitable. Over 10 million years, you have to look at such things as an ice age steamrolling over your city regardless of how it is built. You have to look at continental plates crushing and in the process changing the shape of a formerly flat area into vertical mountain cliffs or even turning your city upside down. You have to look at the crust of the earth being stretched and possibly a new ocean forming where you built your "forever" city. Of course you can TRY to find the most geologically stable spot, but pretty much no matter where you go, over 10 million years, your town will suffer catastrophic events that even the rock itself can't withstand. 

Yes, but with a caveat. Printing money is effectively the same as taxation, but with far less control and supervision. First of all, "the government" always "prints money". Actually, in most countries, it's not the government, but some central bank that is usually semi-independent, such as the Federal Reserve in the USA, the ECB in Europe, or the Bank of England in Britain. and the money is not created through physical printing bills, but through loan transactions. This "printing money" should be balanced by money being destroyed (through loans being paid off, mostly), and economic growth. When more money is created beyond that balance, you get inflation (either systemic inflation throughout the economy, or sometimes investment bubbles such as the housing bubble of the early 21st century, or stock bubbles). Inflation simply means that each unit of currency (dollar or whatever) will be worth less. Now what you are proposing is basically that the extra money goes to finance the government, but those who already have money or income (i.e., the population) suffers the loss of value of money. In other words, the population pays for the government's operation. Which is no different from taxation, just through another means. Here are some of the problems - and benefits - of using "printing money" instead of taxes to finance the government: 

Use clothing that enables you to avoid leaving a scent for this entire operation (haz-mat suit coated in environmental fodder). Observe animal from a distance for a day, at least, noting sleeping habits, diet, temperament, etc. Find where it sleeps (as it's a warm-blooded mammal, it most likely utilize a centralized sleeping location). Test its sleeping patterns. While it is sleeping, systematically come closer at a constant pace until you disturb its rest. Mark the distance (there is no time compensation you need to do. The animal should be aware of its power's limitation, and would therefore run at the first sign of danger rather than time-jump. It would save that ability for emergencies. The 30 second ability would mean that you could have gotten closer for 30 seconds. for this situation, being further away is preferable. Either way, the point at which the animal moves should be perfect) Create an enclosure nearby which is over twice the distance from the creature's den to the mark you have made. The enclosure must be open on the side facing the current den. The opening must be large enough so as not to 'tip off' the creature. Assuming it is of animal-level intelligence, make it around two to three times the width and height of its body. The door of the enclosure must be as silent as possible, and well-oiled. Wait for it to leave its den again, then wait at least 90 seconds from that point. Examine the sleeping area, noting the materials, size, smells, etc. Take items/pieces of the sleeping area, using gloves and other means to mask scent. recreate the den in the center of your enclosure, using pieces of the old den. When the animal leaves its own den again, destroy the sleeping area after 90 seconds, taking more pieces and scattering them in a trail leading to the new den. Use food with the other pieces. Wait for the animal to follow your trail, leading to the new den, which, as it smells like its old den, and not like you, and contains easily attainable food, the animal will utilize. wait 90 seconds after the animal has fallen asleep, using the well-oiled and quiet mechanism. The enclosure's size would help avoid spooking the animal. This would make the door seem like no threat to the animal itself, circumventing the 30s power (why be concerned with what's happening 30 seconds from now if it's not a threat) allow the animal to sleep and awake naturally. Upon it stirring, use the openings in the enclosure to leave food for it. continue feeding it regularly. Begin to introduce items that contain your smell. Start these items off at the edge of the enclosure, away from the food. This will familiarize the animal with you. the outer clothing is no longer needed. Discard it. Begin to make appearances as far from the animal as possible, while still being seen. Bring and deposit food at these points. Over time this will let the animal associate you with the food. behavior allowing, continue to bring the food, but go closer and closer to the animal. Eventually, this will create a bond with the creature. From this point, follow common animal husbandry behavior until you are able to touch the animal, and then more until you are able to attach the tag secure it. Make sure to retreat each time the animal retreats. Release the animal.
