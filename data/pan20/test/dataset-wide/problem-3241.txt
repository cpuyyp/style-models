At first I thought this statement was wrong, but thinking further I couldn't find any example of two unquestionably democratic states engagint a war with eachother. I can only find examples of democracy declaring war to a dictatorship (USA invading Irak in 2003) or a dictatorship invading a democracy (for example Germany invading Czechoslovakia in 1938). Cases of two dictatorship attacking eachother are unfortunately too common so that no example is needed... The best counter-example to A.fm.'s claim I can find is Austria-Hungary declaring war to Serbia in 1914... but both of those countries were more hybrid regimes than full democraties it seems. France declaring war to Prussia in 1870 is also borderline making it, but both countries were kind of hybrid/half-democraties at this point of time. 

The German Empire at the end of the Great War immediately comes to mind. It was expanding on the eastern front, having conquered Poland, Bielarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, Lativa, Estonia (all from the Russian Empire) and Romania. Although it wasn't clear what exactly they were going to do (plain annexation or puppet states) and how they were going to share them between Germany and Austria-Hungary, it was clear the German empire was the great victor of the eastern front, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria having done only modest contributions. According to a book I read on the subject some of the higher generals were still debating whether Germany should have been expanded to the Black Sea or even to the Caspian (!) sea. On the other hand, the empire collapsed on the western front because of a complex combination of : 

For some reason I cannot find reliable source about that. Germany's population were in majority German, but there was also Frenchs in the west, Danes in the north, Lithuanians, and Poles in the east, among other minorities that would cause no problem for Germany. The problem of Frenchs fighting against France, and Lithuanians or Poles fighting against Russia where other Lithuanians and Poles also lived was an obvious problem. I am pretty sure Germany solved this by sending Poles and Lithuanians to the west front to fight France, and sent people from the west of the country toward the east to fight Russia, however I cannot find a source on this right now. Nevertheless my question is, were those people (Poles and Lithuanians on the western front, Frenchs on the eastern front) treated differently than German people (such as making them more often on the front line, and by giving them more risky missions) ? I have heard this was the case, but then again, cannot find any sources. If so, how could the German army know which soldiers were concerned, since ethnicity was not recorded in Germany, and all citizens of the German Empire were considered "German" by the government ? 

The river in the middle of Val d'Avigna is described as the border between Switzerland and Austria. An earlier map from 1853 shows the same border: On a map from 1869 the border is different: 

There is a long history of free imperial cities having extra privileges within the Holy Roman Empire. Many cities in contemporary Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy were former free imperial cities. However, most of them disappeared progressively. When Hitler took power in Germany in 1933, 3 free cities remained : Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen. Unsurprisingly, Hamburg, Bremen are still free cities to this day, which means they are federal Länder states within the Federal Republic of Germany. What is more a mystery is why Lübeck is no longer a city state. Actually, the sole reason the city state does not exist anymore and was incorporated into Schwestig Holstein is because Hitler decided it in 1937, because of his personal dislike of the city (the reason of this dislike is suspected to be because NSDAP support was low). Despite the fact it was obvious that the dissolution of the city state for such a reason is completely illegitimate, the western allies did not recreate a post war city state like they did for Hamburg and Bremen. Is there any reasons the western allies restored 2 of the 3 free cities, but not the third ? [*] Is there any political group in Lübeck that are striving in order to restore their status as an independent federal state ? (It doesn't seem to be the case but I'd just ask in case I might have missed something or used the wrong keywords in German) [*] I'm excluding Berlin as it has a completely separate history which is out of topic here. 

After Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945, many Germans from former minority communities were expelled from central europe. In addition to that, two significantly large areas with German majority were cleansed of all Germans, and repopulated with people from other places. The first place is what is today western Poland, which was repopulated with poles from the Kresy, former eastern Poland and today western Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. The second place is the Czech/formerly Austrian sudetenland, which in reality are multiple mountainous territories in Bohemia and Moravia not restricted to the Sudetes themselves that were assigned to Czechoslovakia. There was however not a very significant Czech population to settle the lands, so with whom did the Czechoslovak government repopulate those areas? I know that there was some Czechs living there before Hitler annexed the areas and were expulsed, and there was Czechs that couldn't return their homes after being freed from camps because their homes had been bombed or burned down. However were those enough to repopulate all the sudetenland ? 

In French we say "Belle Époque", but I don't know if there's an english equivalent. The term refers specifically to the period imediately predecessing the Great War, but there is no clear begining of the eara, it could be as early as 1871 (after the end of the Franco-Prussian war) or later. When using Wikipedia it seem the foreign language have to some extent adopted the French term, however I do not know how commonly they are used. 

The text is less well written, but the Tories chose a Protestant church over a despotic Catholic king; the tories explicitly reject the priest (catholicism) A third source suggests (to me) an answer: these simplistic views were held by fanatical fringes on each side. 

Appian's transcript of Mark Anthony's funeral oration, suggests that Shakespeare wrote for the stage, not for historical accuracy (although this is a record of what was said, not a transcript). 

Flat against flat dissipates force and increases the chance that the hammer will glance off armor. (remember that armor is not flat - it is curved and angled to deflect blows and minimize the transmitted force). Nubs concentrate force and reduce the chance that the hammer will merely slide off the armor. The blow is more likely to convey the force to the inhabitant of the armor. And mea culpa - this answer would be improved by sources. @T.E.D found this discussion of engineering constraints in blunt weapons that is pertinent In a comment to another post, I mentioned that years of martial arts training and acquaintances who like to hit each other in simulated historical combat have taught me that it is perfectly possible to break bones or kill an opponent without breaching armor. Even if the armor is intact, sufficient force can break the bone or cause a coup-counter-coup concussion. But that relies on maximizing the force delivered through the armor. @EvanM's answer is excellent and superior to this one. 

NOTE: I said arguably My point is that every statement of the longest bubble is going to be argued by someone - I'm skeptical of any objective authoritative answer. But OP asked for the longest bubble - I'd argue that the 30 year bubble in housing is a good candidate. Of course, OP didn't specify in which economy; if we looked at the world economy, I'd argue that the valuation of the dollar was divorced from the fundamentals of the dollar from 1945 to 2007 - which is a longer bubble. Someone else could probably argue for some other commodity - wine perhaps? Oil (where cartel politics divorce the fundamentals from the value). Of course, if you had intended to ask about a stock market bubble, you would have specified that in your question. Opinions differ. This man argues that we're in a bubble. I'm sure if I spent 5 minutes searching, I could find someone to take exactly the opposite opinion. Over in the corner, you'll see the gold bugs frothing at the mouth and chanting "fiat money is evil" and insisting that we've been in a bubble since Bretton Woods; fortunately most of them are now easily identifiable by their foil hats, and the fact that their chants have diminished to a weary mumble as reality moves further and further from their ideological purity. (Stop for a moment and ponder the fact that the supply of gold in the world is fixed while both population and productivity continue to rise at a greater than linear rate). (let me pause here and take my tranquilizers - the mention of gold bugs has a negative effect on my blood pressure). When the market corrects, there will be a host of people shouting that this was evidence of a bubble; others will insist just as forcefully that it was a correction. So here is the real question - In what context is the answer to the question useful? What difference would it make if you accepted my argument that housing was the longest bubble? Or the raving loon in the corner's assertion that fiat money is the bubble? Or bitcoin? 

Another article references the same concept (I suspect the primary sources are the same, but sometimes different secondary sources can clarify interpretations) 

Daniel Drezner in his course Foundations of Economic Prosperity suggests that human history can be portrayed as a hockey stick; almost all the progress in human history has occurred since the industrial revolution. 

Thomas Jefferson used the term "American States" (hat tip to @Called2Voyage). but this is both dated 1774 and a reference to the union, not to an individual state per se. Thomas Paine referenced the "United States of America" on 6/29/76. and in Common sense (January 1776) "A Planter" uses the term (although the Paine advocates would take particular notice of the capitalization): 

She might, on the other hand, have a stronger tie to her local lord, and therefore confidently tell him to pound sand. The aristocracy was not a single mind - they were political and happy to cut off their noses to spite their adversaries. The lord in question would know if the local lord were a friend or a foe, and would adjust his behavior based on how confident he was of support. 

So why do I say that there were detectives? When all offenses are civil, you sometimes need to know who is stealing from your building site, or dumping toxic waste in your garden, or whatever. Patrons would have asked their clients to help in such situations, and clients would have hopped to to satisfy the demands of their patrons. They weren't professional detectives, but they were seeking the answers to mysteries on behalf of their "employers". For example, Adultery was a crime - if your spouse was stepping out on you, your clients were obliged to protect your interests and might follow her to find proof. Inheritance law was big - if your siblings were carting off Dad's treasures while you were on military duties, your clients would probably track and report to you so that you could sue. I can't point to any records, but I strongly suggest that the burial societies that formed the linchpin of middle/lower class social structures probably also made sure to look out for one another and protect one another's rights & privileges. One could argue that at various points the Tribune of the Plebs was a sort of a detective - he was supposed to look out for the rights of the Plebs. But quickly the office was politicized.
