It could be wear or poor adjustment of your hub bearings. Try lifting the bike up at the front and try moving the wheel from one side to the other. There should be little or no movement. 

The chain is what causes all the wear on your drive components. It is called chain stretch but your chain does not stretch it wears at each pin or rivet and increases in length. When this wear is excessive it wears the cassette teeth, chain set teeth and the jockey wheels on your rear gear. When all this equipment is new, Keep it clean and oiled. Buy yourself a chain wear gauge and this will indicate to you when to change your chain before it causes excessive wear on your other drive components. Depending on how much you cycle you might require two new chains a year but that is cheaper than; new cassette, chain rings and jockey wheels. If you cycle for a year and clock up 1000-1500 miles you will require to replace the chain and cassette. If you don't and just replace the chain you will find the gears will jump and that is due to the wear that is on the rear cogs. Hope that helps. 

Surprised no one mentioned this: lever is not positioned well. It must not be clamped to the curved part of the bar. It should be moved closer to the handle. That will move the lever away from the handlebars, and give it and the cable more travel. Also, the cable should be replaced and the cable housing straightened at the point it enters the lever. 

The reason was the sprocket after all. Changing the freewheel resolved the issue. I had some problem finding a service which has the wrench for that old Sachs/Maillard freewheels. Replaced it with standard Shimano 6-speed, and everything works smoothly now! Thanks all for help. 

To ride a bike efficiently the ball of your foot must be over the pedal spindle and to answer your question, toe clips and straps are one way of doing this. Up to the mid-80s that was the method used by all serious cyclists. You could buy small, medium and large toe clips for any size of shoe to fix your feet in the correct position. Metal or leather shoe plates with a groove that fitted over the rear pedal plate were nailed to the soles of the leather shoes. The strap had a quick release buckel and went through the pedal and through a loop on the toe clip. When the foot engaged the pedal and the strap was pulled tight your foot was held very tight. To get your foot out you had to bend down and flick the strap buckle, lift your foot and pull it back. The modern method is clipless pedals, they serve the same purpose, fixing the ball of your foot always over the pedal spindle. The initial cost is quite expensive as you require special pedals, shoes and cleats. When the cleats are fitted to the shoes you just have to push your foot down on the pedal till it clicks and to release it you turn your foot to the left or right. The holding tension can be adjusted on the pedals to allow for easier entry and release. They are very good and I recommend you buy them. To see and feel the benefit of fixing your feet just try going up a steep hill or sprinting as hard as you can, or ask yourself why do all the Pros use them. 

Depending on your local regulations, claiming the lane might be illegal (it is here where I live, for example). So, my advice would it be to ride on the right side of the road (assuming that right is the driving side), but not getting too close to the curb because of the debris, gravel, car doors etc. When you see (and hear) someone behind you wanting to overtake you, just move some to the right (and optionally give him a sign with your hand). However, don't go to the right if you see that they can't overtake you safely, i.e. if the road is too narrow there, or if you see a car coming from the other direction. On the traffic light, claim the lane! That will prevent drivers cutting you from behind, while it doesn't bother no one (you occupy less space than a car, and they are not waiting for you, but for the light anyways). When the light opens, and you pass the intersection, return to the right part of the lane. 

In UK we drive on the left. When making a right turn on my bike I carry out the same procedure I use when driving my car. I turn my head over my right shoulder and look for a gap in the traffic, when there is a big enough gap I make a positive signal with my right arm and steer out to the left of the line in the center of the road. I apply my brake with my left hand gently to slow my speed a bit while signaling and about 50M before my turning I put both hands on my brakes. Car driver like you to be positive with your positioning and signaling on the road as they can pass me on my left without having to stop. The trafic comming towards me quite often slow down and flash their lights to let me cross. One of the biggest problems is if you are on a steep hill and want to turn right especially if you are climbing out of the saddle. You then have to turn your head and look, then position yourself correctly on the road without a signal, I find that more of a problem. 

My chain is skipping only on the smallest sprocket, and it skips with every crank turn. The chain is not stretched. Also, chainrings are almost new. Could this freewheel be the reason, it doesn't seem worn out to me (although it's old): 

(I replaced the handlebars with straight one on mine) I know that there were some weird designs back in '90s, but some reason probably exists for creating a bike with such a long stem. Doesn't it create uncomfortable riding position? 

I know that road caliper brakes use shorter (and wider?) pads than v-brakes and MTB cantilevers, but I don't exactly understand the reason behind. What would happen if I mount longer pads on road-style calipers and vice versa? 

Wobbling cassettes should be absent from, not present on, every bike. It is possible that the wobble is caused by worn splines on what might be a soft (aluminium, as opposed to steel) freehub. I myself recently blogged about such an issue at $URL$ . The wobble might instead be a result of an incorrectly seated lock-ring, or a missing spacer from behind the cassette (in which case you might find this link of interest: $URL$ 

You asked: will changing the front to e.g. 39/52 setup make a noticable difference? My answer is an unequivocal 'yes'. If you can however, consider 34 or 36-tooth inner and 50T outer, if you can find chainrings that fit your spider. TA make a large range of chainrings, however new ones will probably cost more than the monetary value of your bike. 

I got a bicycle like this one (90's trekking/city bike). When I got it, the headset seemed overtightened, when I took it apart I saw that it was somewhat damaged (looks like ridden for some time while being too loose). I noticed that the bottom bearing is needle, upper was regular ball bearing. I managed to get it together and tighten it just right, but I think it should replaced anyways. Will I be able to replace it with ordinary ball bearing based headset (I guess I won't be able to find the same ball/needle set easily)? Are head tubes for threaded headsets all the same? 

Q: You generally see the top tube on steel bikes being parallel to the ground, whereas on a lot of carbon bikes it's angled. Why is that? A: It is because most steel bikes you see are old, designed and built in an age before the sloping top-tube was conceived (for Giant bicycles by Mick Burrows in the mid-90's I believe). So aside from recent artisan-built steel, most steel bikes will have horizontal top-tubes (parallel to the ground). By contrast, most carbon bikes were made as jm2 above has stated, with saving money on mould-making a key consideration, hence the slope. Interestingly, many custom-made steel bikes are now made sloping as well, because because its seen as a more modern look. Yet perversely some of the poshest new carbon frames (eg some Legend, Parlee and BMC frames) are now made with horizontal, or near-horizontal top tubes, because their customers want a more 'traditional' look. What goes around comes around. 

I have an old 27" road bike in a long, lazy and cheapish process of restoration. I'd like to put 28" wheels on, which requires 4mm longer brake reach. The bicycle used to have fenders and the existing 27" rim is already a bit far from the fork crown (and from the caliper bolt). I had an idea to try to deepen the fork dropout in order to get the wheel closer to the crown, there seems to be enough space to do that, and still keep enough to get the axle bolt tightened. Is there any reason I shouldn't do that? 

Straighten your seat. It's pointed a bit to the right, causing your body to slightly slant to the left to compensate, moving center of the mass a bit to the left, causing whole bike to lean and turn left. 

You are almost certainly doing something wrong, so why not simply pop back to the shop and get them to show you how they use the pump that they sold you? Bending the valve stem is virtually impossible - if you are bending anything it is perhaps the valve body. Take care to ensure that after you release the thumb-lever lock (you ARE releasing it, aren't you?) that you remove the head of the pump without wiggling it, as such an action is sure to bend the valve body. 

Why is my used Ultegra 10-sp cassette wobbly to the touch on a new Ambrosio hub? All spacers present/correct and 11-sprocket well-seated before torquing 40nM lockring. I tried another (used) 10-sp 11-21 cassette on the same hub and there is no wobble for that one. Puzzled!
