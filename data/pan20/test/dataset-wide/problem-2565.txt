Can someone please elaborate for me please. I need to understands what the counter-part sign is & how to extend it. Is it a mental image you have? So a kasina ot any other mental image you form? 

I'm having trouble understanding what they mean here. What iis life-continuum? It said in brackets consciousness so it's disrupting consciousness of the jhana object? What i guess they mean is once you come out of jhana use applied thought to focus on the things that intruped that jhana then once you have "applied" applied thought move to focus on the objects with sustain thought once you can do this uninterrupted you mastered adverting? 

I have read once you have reached the bliss stage you should take your focus off the object and on the blissful sensations and hold it. Then in time you will be in Jhana. But i also read in other sources you should just stay with the object and one pointed focus will rise that way. Which is it? This confuse me. I've reached bliss i kept focusing on my earth kasina but before i could fully enter the first jhana i felt my breath fading and it scared me out of my mediation. So i don't know if focusing on my object would have allowed me to reach jhana. 

I am reading A Critical Analysis Of The Jhanas In the book we were going over wise considration and how it will help you eliminate the hindrances. But i am having trouble understand what this is referring to. Any help would be appreciated. 

The first one represents desire, grasping something whose roots are impermanent. The next ones look like Tathagatagarbha. 

I think he started by learning teachers' doctrines and practices, but (having understood them) finding them unsatisfactory. 

The analysis quoted here says that, literally, it could be either; but that, looking at various places in which it's used in context, it makes more sense if it means 'direct'. The people on that site seemed to agree that that's the best analysis. And, this article makes a similar argument to explain why 'direct' is a more fitting meaning than 'only'. 

Also, well done for going to school and so on, working hard, having friends, and starting to learn about Buddhism. I hope that works out well for you. 

Wikipedia's Buddhism in the West suggests that's one of the early references (that there's nothing earlier than the 19th century). It's word with a history of meaning in the West (see e.g. Age of Enlightenment). Bhikkhu Bodhi uses the word "enlightenment" a lot, e.g. in his book In the Buddha's Words. He uses it to translate words like sambodhi: 

I'm surprised because "enjoyment of splendid food" isn't something I would usually expect to be taught is the fruit of attentiveness; but maybe it was an appropriate doctrine for Anāthapiṇḍika (who was rich). 

I think they are connected -- at least according to Tibetan Buddhism, and perhaps according to other schools of Buddhism as well (1) -- and the connection is, as you said, misunderstanding. Wikipedia's description of the Three Poisons says ... 

I'm having trouble truly understanding nimattas. I use visualization for my jhana mediation. It's what focus my mind best and allowed me to almost enter jhana. But if i do visualize, will the nimatta still appear? How would i recognise it? And once it appear do i move off my object to it? Also i read this passage explaining what a nimtta means in the modern day. I wish to know does this do a great job explaining it. 

What is the goal for this mastery exactly? I'm guessing it's to look back at your jhana meditation and see what happen. What went wrong, what are things you can improve, what lead to jhana & lsot the jhana etc. Is this correct? I want to make sure i understand completely. 

Do they both play a role in getting rid of the hindrances or is one better then the other? How do they eliminate them? 

They say to master jhana you must master five factors. I understand the first four but mastery of reflection is kind of leaving me unsure. I think i get it. Once you come out of the jhana state, you refect on the absorption factors like you do the jhana factors you focus on each until the hindrances is gone. But what are these absotbtion factors. Do i just think about it or stsrt a second meditations on each factor and be aware of them? How do i know what these factors are and distinguish them? They also say there different absorption factor to reflect on. Can you help me understand 

Re. the first paragraph of your question, perhaps the teacher you met was talking about a so-called pratyekabuddha or paccekabuddha (it's useful to know the technical word if you want to read more about it, see also e.g. the 'external links' etc. at the end of that article). 

Other answers on this site suggest that Jainism was already established when the Buddha was teaching, for example, 

Also, Taṇhā is desire (or thirst) but not all desire is Taṇhā. Wikipedia's Contrast to wholesome desire (chanda) says, 

I wonder whether to deduce that it's OK as long there is no intent to deceive. But saying "there are toys" (in the 'Parable of the burning house') seems like an actual deception. It's beneficial/compassionate, at least. And skillful/necessary. Maybe it's not even deceptive (it's hard to tell when it's a parable or metaphor). So, yes: "portraying the truth via a careful miunderstanding" seems to have a basis in literature (Mahayana and Vajrayāna, even if not Theravada). Upāya is apparently a Mahayana concept. Havig said this I hope you won't use it as an excuse to deceive people. I think there's some justification for saying that ignorance is a cause of suffering, and that deception goes with ignorance, so I hope you won't be deceiving people. 

The first five arahants are said to have attained that after hearing the Buddha's second sutta, which was the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta: The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic. MN 26 however says, 

It helps to identify you socially as a monk (as does the uniform clothing), so that people know when they see you, "that person can be identified as a monk". At the same time it helps to alter, remove or hide your personal identity, e.g. as a person with an individual appearance such as hair color and hair style. I suppose another practical benefit is that it's also clean and cool (an opposite extreme, for some non-Buddhist sramanas, was to not touch or cut their hair at all, so that it became long and matted). So far as I know the practice pre-dates Buddhism: MN 26 says, 

I think being conscious and mindful must make you look sad. Quite the contrary. If you look sad, you might just have attached to much to what you're doing, feeling tense and tightened up. This may become obvious if you feel the tension in your forehead and tell yourself to relax. There's a strong coupling between the expressions of the body and the feelings. If you are experiencing joy in any form, it's almost impossible to look sad. As in meditation, when that little sparkle of bliss comes up, there's no reason not to look happy. Allow yourself to enjoy the work you're doing, smiling and laughing isn't a bad thing. Maybe you find reasons for happiness within the work, as you are content with well it all fits together. There's no obligation to freak out about some superficial video on the internet - there are so many real nice things your mindfulness can observe. 

If you want to build a house, it is easier done having read a book about it than without. It will guide you through the process, hint you at problems that may arise and give possible solutions. But then, there may be other solutions around, no problem with that. On the other hand, reading the book alone will not be much beneficial; without actually building your house, you will not be able to sleep under the protecting roof. As for "being not compatible" - I think this is rather unlikely, as long as you are open-minded. Of course, one has to be careful not to take laziness as incompatibility, i.e. it would be too easy to give up meditation after 30 seconds, labelling it "frustrating, my mind isn't built for that". So I take the literature as a wealth of wonderful ideas I can ponder on. 

Now i think what unwise and wise consideration is the things you focus on. Unwise Consideration maybe focusing on your past or your future asking question that have no really meaning pondering them. While wise is focusing on suffering and overcoming it. Is thia correct? 

The books and videos all describe it as, Looking at jhana and its factors in retrospective knowledge What does this mean exactly? Is it going over the events that happened during the jhana? there anything specific you suppose to do? 

As I'm learning to master the first jhana one must do two things, master the five masteries & be able to extend the sign. For the masteries, • Mastety Of Adverting  ×Turning your attention & focus on any jhana factor after! anywhere,time or place • Mastery Of Attainment   × Entering jhana concentration quickly, Anytime you wish  • Mastery of Resolving ×Staying in the absorption for as long as one wants.  • Mastery of Emerging × Emerge from The Jhanas Quickly • Mastery Of Reflection ×Looking at & learn each thing you did to enter each jhana factor. Please tell me if I'm incorrect. Now for extending the sign. I don't truly understand how to do such a thing, or even what it is. Here's a passage from the book I'm reading. 

I have been meditating for a while now and i found my way to get into jhana, well i haven't enter jhana but it was more me not fully in knowing how but now i think i understand. But one thing i keep getting stuck on is the signs. I haven't to my knowledge experienced a nimita. Maybe cause i use visualization to enter the jhanas From what i gathered first you have initial & sustain thought. Then as time goes on you developed joy. Which brings this pleasant feeling. Then you move your attention from that to the pleasant feeling to enter rapture and the first jhana. So where do any counter or learning sign come in. Is that only for certain meditations
