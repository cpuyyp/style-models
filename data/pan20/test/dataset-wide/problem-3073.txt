Gaius Gracchus and his reform law, Lex Militaris, made the state responsible for supplying the military with equipment and clothing. It also meant that merchants and craftsmen would be employed providing this equipment and thus receiving a more stable and reliable income from the sale of supplies to the government rather than individuals. Military supply contractors made money off the government even back then. In some cases, the merchants followed along with the fort/road system and established facilities to smelt iron, work lumber and so forth. The logistical advantage of the Roman road system also made it possible to move supplies over longer distances and required fewer manufacturing areas. 

Edit to add some additional ones, based on the criteria of less than 12 months between coups... In Bolivia, on October 6, 1970 Juan José Torres seized power from Alfredo Ovando Candía. In turn, on August 21, 1971, General Hugo Banzer staged a successful coup with the help of the military and, perhaps, assistance as part of Operation Condor. In Burundi in July 1966, Prince Ntare V deposed his father. On November 28th of 1966, Michel Micombero, who had earlier assisted Ntare, staged a coup, abolished the monarchy and took power himself. In Ethiopia, September 12, 1974 Aman Mikael Andom overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie I. On November 17th 1974, Andom was killed by forces loyal to the Provisional Military Administrative Council (aka Derg). In 1987, Fiji had a string of coups. In 1983, the island of Grenada had several coups, finally ending with the intervention of the US. Haiti saw several coups from 1988 onward after the departure of Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier in 1986 up until the threat of US intervention in 1994. Leadership changed hands several times and exactly who was in charge wasn't always clear. In 1994, the Rwandan Civil War resulted in several leadership changes and terrible genocide. There are certainly some others I didn't cover here so feel free to add more examples. 

I'm assuming you're referring to Colombus' first voyage, which resulted in the tentative discovery of new lands west of Europe. Colombus' own conclusion after his voyage was that he had reached islands off the coast of India, or perhaps China (Cathay), and repeatedly referred to the land masses he encountered as "las Indias", and their inhabitants as "Indios". So no, its safe to say that Colombus himself had no inkling that he had discovered a new landmass totally unknown to his European contemporaries. He did make the assumption that there was a continental landmass beyond the islands he "discovered" but he remained convinced after his first journey that that landmass was Asia. I wasn't until Colombus' third voyage that he encountered and described a previously unknown continental landmass (which turned out to be South America). But even then he still wrote in his reports that he assumed the landmass to be some part of Asia. Its important to bear in mind here that the concept of "Asia" was poorly understood and loosely applied by Europeans in the late 15th, early 16th centuries. Knowledge of the spherical nature of the earth was well known among educated Europeans during Colombus' lifetime, any many who interpreted Colombus' discoveries at the time thought that he had encountered the western tip of Asia. This is reflected in the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed only two years after Colombus' first voyage divided the earth into two hemispheres, with one half for Spain & the other for Portugal. This image depicts the geographic thinking in the decade after Colombus' first voyage. Imagine the two circles on the map forming a sphere so that the Caribbean is off the coast of Asia and you'll have an idea of how Colombus and his contemporaries thought. European exploration progressed rapidly after Columbus, however, and by 1513 Europeans had confirmation that the Americas and Asia were two distinct continents. 

As I noted above, Lindbergh's and America First's opinions were the predominate ones when it came to non-interventionism in Europe. From America First on the Charles Lindbergh site: 

Then, I encountered John Plumbe. He and his chain of Daguerreotype galleries from 1840-1847 are a good example of what I was looking for. I was looking at too late of a time period. Thanks to RI Swamp Yankee mentioning the Daguerreotype. Overall, it seems that a Daguerreotype studio gave way over time to the photography studio. As it remains today, it was a relatively inexpensive business to get into and one that has a lot of turnover. 

The tools used were primarily the standard scythe and plow which had been around for centuries. There were some improvements, such as the mouldboard plough. These tools were made by local craftsmen. The tools were generally either purchased by the landowner or they were crafted by someone in the employ (or servitude) of the landowner. Smaller landowners either made do with what they could craft themselves or that they could barter for. Agricultural knowledge was generally passed down from parent to child. Formal study in agriculture wasn't common during that time since it was seen as a common pursuit, although there was more interest in biology and animal husbandry than plants. Most landowners practiced the 3 crop rotation pattern. Which crops were grown/rotated depended on local conditions and markets. Typically, one section would have a grain, such as wheat, barley or rye, another would have a legume, such as peas or lentils, and the remainder wouldn't be planted that season. You may want to take a look at this online book, A History of Agriculture in Europe and America, for more info. There are some rather expensive college textbooks around that essentially aggregate info from manorial and other such documents. However, you can find much of this source info online for free if you search for it. 

There is another ancient Greek religious site which meets the criteria of what you're describing. The Ploutonion at Hierapolis, a temple dedicate to Pluto/Hades, was build upon the entrance to a cave which emitted naturally occurring carbon dioxide. The local hellenes who built and maintained the temple thought the cave to be an entrance to the underworld. Priests of the temple are also believed to have conducted animal sacrifices by leading bulls into the cave beneath the temple (source). Additionally there is some evidence that some of the 'Fire temples' built by Zoroastrians in Central and South Asia used naturally occurring combustible gas to maintain their "eternal flames". These fire temples with eternal flames turned into pilgrimage sites for Zoroastrians from all over Greater Persia. Examples 1, 2. I'll update this if I find more examples of religious buildings being built in response to a naturally occuring gas source. 

The prime example I can think of is Russia. In 1917, the February Revolution put a coalition government, headed by Alexander Kerensky, in charge after Tsar Nicolas abdicated the throne. The October Revolution put Lenin and the communists in charge of the government although a civil war and unsuccessful counter revolutions went on until 1921. 

Well, back in the 70's when I was in Army ROTC, I carried a M60 machine gun (23lbs), 4 bandoliers of blank ammo (about another 25-30lbs), maybe a grenade sim or 2, 2 canteens of water and C rations and other field gear. My total was probably around 90-100lbs. Later, in the USMC, I carried a M16 or a 9mm pistol, ammo and assorted field gear that probably weighed around 70lbs which was closer to average. Due to lighter materials, MRE's and such, the load is a bit lighter today but not by that much. The newer modular designs (MOLLE, ILBE, etc) in tactical wear make it easier to lighten the load when needed and more comfortably carry heavy loads in the 80-100lb range. British redcoats and the Roman soldiers actually carried around about the same in weight on average as today's infantry, roughly in the 60-70lbs range. However, they often carried less actual gear and supplies in quantity. The difference now is how efficiently gear can be carried and the weight and bulk of materials. 

Apologies if the History Stackexchange is the wrong place for this question but: In what ways could a cadet branch come into life? Why would a younger sibling in a royal or noble house start his own as a cadet branch? This information is for personal, non-historical, writing; therefore the most useful answers would be ones that simply give me the reasons why it would happen in general. For instance, the specific political reasonings behind the making of a cadet branch in a single house I fear would simply go over my head. I would like the general reasons why it could happen that could apply to any royal or noble house, real or otherwise. Many thanks. 

In regards to marrying into noble houses, if a noble man marries a noble woman from a different house, I would assume one of two things happens: 1. The woman takes the man's name and the two houses become allied to one another. 2. They make their own name and marshall the coat of arms. If this is incorrect, please do correct me by all means. But say a common man marries a woman of a noble house. Does he take their name? Does she take his name but he is of her house? Or, assuming the noble woman is the heir, does she take his name and the name of the house changes also? I would point out I am speaking in general for fantasy purposes (and yes, I know I can technically say what I want because I'm making it up, but I'd like to have strong basis in fact), so I understand that this exact situation may in fact never have actually occurred; but even so, I'm supposing there'd be a set precedent in case. EDIT: As it's fantasy it isn't strictly European but drawing from pretty much anywhere with a similar social structure. Information from any European country or elsewhere (Russia, for instance, but anywhere) would make me very grateful, especially if the area could be mentioned in the answer. Also, let me stress, this isn't like a plot point or anything, I'm just curious but as I'm thinking about it in terms of personal fantasy fiction it doesn't have to have a real-world example of it happening to satisfy me. I realise it's an unlikely thing to happen but the point is it is possible. 

To my knowledge (though please correct me if I'm wrong) there is no extant historical account of the first Norse settlers in Iceland encountering any previously settled peoples. Quite the opposite actually. However, mitochondrial DNA analysis of samples taken from skeletal remnants of the medieval Icelandic population tells a very different story. The researchers for this study took DNA samples from 68 medieval Icelandic settlers, and compared the DNA sequences to control samples taken from present day individuals of Celtic and Icelandic descent. The researchers found that the medieval samples more closely matched samples taken from Celtic regions of Scotland than they did samples taken from modern Iceland. The study explicates the divergence between medieval and modern Icelandic genotypes by theorizing that genetic drift is the primary causal factor, rather than gene flow from additional scandinavian settlers. While this study has been interpreted by popular press in Ireland to demonstrate that: 

First of all, perhaps my terminology is dodgy here, but by nobleman I mean A member of a noble family, of noble birth and by lord I mean a ruler -- that is, the Duke of Somewhere would be a lord; his second son (no land, no title) would be a nobleman. Probably not right, but for the purpose of this question I'll stick with that. Also, by Middle-ages I (perhaps incorrectly) refer to Europe, roughly 11th-16th Centuries. Could a nobleman join the clergy (and become a priest or whatever -- my knowledge on church titles isn't massive)? If so, would he still be a nobleman? I mean, he'd be of noble birth (in most cases) but would he be considered a nobleman still after joining the church? Perhaps further, could a lord join the clergy? And if so would he have to relinquish his title and lands? I hear of, for instance, the second son of a king joining the clergy while his older brother becomes king: it's one of those things that one hears, but I cannot actually find any evidence of it -- and again, even if it's true, would he still be considered a nobleman? 

In reality this study just demonstrates that early Icelandic populations are genetically more similar to modern day Celtic peoples of Britain than they are to modern day Icelandic people and, with the lack of historical records demonstrating a definitive living Celtic presence on Iceland at the time of the Norse settlement, any historical inferences from the genetic data would be merely speculative. Is it possible that there were Celtic peoples in Iceland at the time of the Norse arrival and this accounts for the medieval genotype? Yes. Is there historical proof of this? Unfortunately no. 

This is a uniform patch worn by the Allied French Occupational forces in Austria immediately following the end of WW2. The French zone of occupation in Austria was referred to by French high command as "le Tyrol du nord et le Vorarlberg", and corresponds with modern day Austrian states of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. C.F.O.A. stands for Corps françaises d'occupation en Autriche.
