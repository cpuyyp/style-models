Dependent arising is called 'the king of reasoning' because it leads to a correct understanding of emptiness and avoids the two extremes. According to Prasangika, they are three types of dependent-arising. It is a tenet unique to Prasangika. 

As a conclusion, I would advise you to emphasize the taking of refuge, generating motivation, intending to protect your mind from laxity and excitement from the beginning… emphasize the application of introspection as well… and emphasize the training in tightening/relaxing the apprehension. 

Arise simultaneously Have the same object [of engagement] Take the same aspect [of blue] Arise in dependence upon the mental sense power And so forth. 

It is said that lama Je Tsonkhapa could have achieved enlightenment with an actual consort, but he would have to disrobe (or to ensue a defeat). Instead, he chose to achieve enlightenment in the intermediate state. So, there are these two ways of actualizing the completion stage and upholding the secret and wisdom initiations. One them would be a defeat. Other practices, such as the consumption of infinitesimally small dosage of alcohol, is not considered as a transgression of the pratimoksha. During Lama Chöpa Tsok, for instance, we dip our finger into alcohol and lick it. There is no practice where you consume more alcohol than that. In addition, we say that if you refuse to do it while you actually took a highest yoga tantra initiation, it is breaking your tantric commitments. 

Warning: To not make it too long, I avoided quotes. In addition, this is merely a summary. Just like with Theravada, there are interpretations. Since I present things in a traditional way, please do not take it personal when I seem to despise so-called Hinayana tenets or practices. 

Thích Nhất Hạnh is a Vietnamese Zen master in the lineage of Huineng. The Caodong Chan school in China and the Soto Zen school in Japan also proceed from Huineng. In Understanding Our Mind (Chapter 13, Indra’s Net), Thích Nhất Hạnh refers to the Avatamsaka Sutra: 

Once mindfulness is established (i.e. you are holding your object) and free from laxity, you will apprehend your object in such a manner that your mind will become clear with regard to it. Conversely Gross laxity causes a lack of clarity. Tsongkhapa writes: 

There are three lineages of pratimoksha vows and none of them prohibits the eating of meat. Anyway, the transmission of the pratimoksha was lost in Japan, as attests the fact that the "monk" is married and lives with his wife. He surely has the bodhisattva vows, however. There are also a number of lineages of bodhisattva vows. Some prohibit the eating of meat and some do not. For instance, in the Brahma Net Sutra, it says: 

Mental factors that you cultivate, a bit like a sportsman. For instance, mindfulness, alertness and concentration. Experiences of yours (that are also mental factors, in fact) that indicate something about the quality of your mind. For instance, Prasrabhi indicate the achievement of śamatha. Each dhyāna has its branches as well. In this respect, each branch indicate something about the quality of one's mind. For instance, if you abide in neither-pleasure-nor-pain, it shows you abide in the fourth dhyāna. The objects you pay attention to. This is because the purpose of meditation is to get to open one's eyes so as to see things the way they are. Another way of saying is that the purpose is to directly realize the sixteen aspects of the four noble truths. 

The meaning is that a non-virtue conjoined with the wisdom of emptiness and bodhicitta is a similitude of non-virtue. It looks like a non-virtuous actions but it is not. One has to keep in mind that such do not occur prior to the Mahayana path of seeing. A non-virtue in the continuum of anyone but a bodhisattva on any of the ten grounds is a non-virtue regardless of one's intention. See the topic: How does upaya (skillful means) feature in Tibetan Buddhism? 

Abiding nirvana. It is the nirvana of hearers and solitary realizers. We refer to it, in a somehow derogatory fashion, as "individual liberation". Non-abiding nirvana. It is the final true cessation, the nirvana that bodhisattvas attain when they achieve full perfect enlightenment - the path of no more learning. 

In Mahayana abhidharma, we speak of the two mental factors that I would think are quiet similar to the "moral conscience" that you allude to. These two might be the same as 'shame' and 'conscience' in MA45. The two are: 

It is difficult for me to conceive, and to admit, that Cittamatrin refute external existence altogether. It would mean they refute that one is born from a mother and a father, and so forth. Moreover, I doubt Tibetan scholars who claim that 'Cittamatrin refute external existence' because they have an agenda. Tibetan scholars often simplify (if not even caricature) their opponent's positions (in this case, Cittamatrin). So, not sticking to Tibetan literature only, my idea was to seek whether Cittamatrin actually refute external existence by reading works written by proponents of the Cittamatra school. Let us consider Suzuki, in Studies in the Lankavatara (p. 114). He writes: 

4. Killing that is karma that you have neither done nor accumulated is whatever is not included in the above three. Tsongkhapa does not give example. 

If you lack enthusiasm on the outset, you will be very prone to generate laxity. Thus, taking refuge in the beginning of the meditation session is useful. The purpose of doing is to generate a virtuous motivation, enthusiasm, dwelling on the reasons for practicing, give yourself a sense of direction so that you are not lost and that your practice really makes sense. That is usually uplifting. While setting motivation, it is customary to intend the application of the antidote (i.e. "Aware that laxity and excitement might arise during my meditation session, I will apply mindfulness to oppose excitement, and introspection to oppose both of them. I will tighten my mind to the object when I will notice it is lax. And so forth"). Tsongkhapa writes: 

Svabhāva stands for inherent existence. From an early Madhyamika viewpoint, there are two types of dependent-arising: 

According to Lama Je Tsongkhapa, actions done in a dream are actions done but not accumulated. On the other hand, setting the intention to kill someone and not doing it is accumulated but not done. A karma that is done and not accumulated, or accumulated but not done, is a "karma whose result you not definitely but only possibly experience" according to Tsongkhapa. In addition, purifying an action that is done and accumulated, by way of the four opponent powers, transforms it into an action that is done and not accumulated. In the Lam Rim Chen Mo, volume 1, Je Tsongkhapa says: 

The bodhisattva vows that I have (in Tibetan Buddhism) do not prohibit the eating of meat. Neither does it advise to restrain from eating meat. Most Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese have the bodhisattva vows from a lineage rooted in the Brahma Net Sutra, and therefore are encouraged to restrain from eating meat. Even then, practitioners do not adhere that strictly to the bodhisattva vows. 

Based on the Vipassana retreat I attended (and translated), when it comes to place one's mindfulness one one's mind(s), the trick is to start with identifying the function of the mind: seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. The mind is that which is clear and knowing. Its function is to know (realize) objects and it is easier to identify this aspect than it is to identify its clarity factor (which is its nature and makes it able to take the subjective aspect of what it apprehends, in the same way a mirror takes the aspect of whatever it reflects). I suggest you start by identifying the functions of your mind: seeing, hearing, and so forth. You can also read Analayo Bhikkhu on the topic. 

We say that a Hinayana arhat still has limitations, obstacles that prevent him from achieving the welfare of others as well as his own. On the other hand, a [fully enlightened] buddha abandoned all obstacles and thus is able to achieve the welfare of others, and achieved his own. This is because there are two obscurations that a buddha has abandoned: 

Tripitaka is taught to and learned by monks in the monasteries and laypeople are encouraged to learn. From a Tibetan viewpoint, the texts H.H. quoted are included within one of the three baskets. Shantideva's Bodhisattvacharyavatara is included in the Sutra Pitaka (although it is not a sutra), Asanga's Mahāyāna Sūtrālamkāra kārikā is included in the Abhidharma Pitaka, Kamalashila's Stages of Meditation belongs to the Abhidharma Pitaka, Nagarjuna's Karika belongs to the Abhidharma Pitaka as well, and so forth. In the ninth chapter of the Bodhisattva Deeds, Shantideva explains that anything that is included within one of the three baskets was the speech – or at least the intention – of Lord Buddha. His Holiness the Dalaï-Lama highlighted this principle. In Illuminating the Path to Enlightenment, he writes: 

So, to answer your question: one needs to cultivate the union of calm abiding and special insight on emptiness (the wisdom side) conjointly to bodhicitta (part of the method side). The first time a bodhisattva realizes emptiness directly, he enters the 1st bhumi. 

According to Mahayana, a person can become a buddha after reaching nirvana. We hold that all sentient beings will, sooner or later, become buddhas - be it after they reached nirvana or not. As to the hearers and solitary realizers, we say that while they dwell in abiding nirvana, the buddhas manifest to them and encourage them to enter the Mahayana path, so that they will in turn become buddha - thereby achieving their own benefits completely, and the benefits of others. This is the presentation of the Abhisamaya-Alamkara: 

Self, in the sense of the person, do exist conventionally. Self, in the sense of inherent existence, is utterly non-existent. To put it another way: the person is an object apprehended by a valid cognizer while inherent existence is perceived by a cognizer that is not valid... a cognizer that is a wrong consciousness. The wrong consciousness apprehending inherent existence is called ignorance. This ignorance is the first of the 12 links of dependent-arising and it is the root of samsara. The ignorance that is the conception of self of the person apprehends the self (in the sense of the person) as possessing a self (in the sense of being inherently existent). From a Prasangika viewpoint, the eye-consciousness in the continuum of an ordinary being apprehending a person is (1) valid with regard to the entity of the thing (i.e. apprehending a person as a person) but (2) is wrong with regard to the mode of existence of the thing (i.e. apprehending the person to exist inherently). 

All in all, you can assert that non-emptiness is empty, because it amounts to associate a non-existent (i.e. non-emptiness) with a negative predicate (the lack of something). 

If you eat when you are not hungry, there is no such relief, no such pleasant feeling, no such experience of "happiness in the aspect of a pleasant feeling", and it is experienced as suffering of suffering (a quiet gross form of suffering). You are not mislead to conceive of the object as being in the nature of happiness. 

There is here a 119 pages transcript of a teaching given by Khenrinpoche Geshe Chonyi, in which he answers that exact same question. Search for 'what is merit' and you will find the answer, page 26. Although Khenrinpoche's answer is not extremely precise (it that it might not stand debate) there are greatly illuminating points: 

In Buddhanath, there are a few Shedra (i.e. "places of teachings") open to Westerners. The question is always: do they teach in English? In India, there is the Institute of Buddhist Studies and Dialectics. I am sorry I cannot help you much with this. But do not think that you have to live in one of these countries to be a monk in a Tibetan tradition. There are places in the West. 

In Tibetan Buddhism, the Salam texts are texts that describe grounds and path. This chart is very useful. You also find explanations of grounds and paths scattered between Lam Rim texts, Lojong texts (such as Shantideva's Bodhisattvacharyavatara, Asanga's Bodhisattvabhumi, etc) as well as in Tenet texts and Abhidharma texts. To put things simply: 

According to Tibetan system of tenets, the Vaibhāṣikas so-called 'Hinayana school of tenets' defines an ultimte truth as: 

Tighten your mode of apprehending the object and sustain it Attend to a cause for the mind to move outward again, something joyful and virtuous. Attend to a sign of light, such as sunshine, and clear away the laxity. Not meditate on a disenchanting object, because disillusionment is a cause for the mind to withdraw inward. Remember that enthusiasm[...] will counteract laxity. 

This citation means that both persons and phenomena are empty of true existence. Thus, it is not true that "Mahayana Agamas do not discuss the nature of other non-sentient things". In his Commentary on Aryadeva’s Four Hundred, Chandrakirti says: 

Are there Bodhisattva practices in Theravada? (such as the cultivation of Bodhicitta and the six perfections presented in Mahayana traditions) Since we find occurrences in the Pali Canon, why do we often hear that the notion of bodhisattva is a late notion? 

I answer, since you tagged Tibetan Buddhism. However, personal practice is a serious matter and I believe you should ask a qualified teacher. 

We all experienced a situation where it is so easy to advise friends when they face difficulties. But when it comes to us, we become clueless, are left in the dark, we loose perspective. This is a forgetfulness that accompanies all afflictions. Whenever we are subject to an affliction, be it anger, sadness, lust, etc. we are subject to this type of forgetfulness. Indeed, the three higher trainings (Sila, Samadhi, Panna) will help see things clearly so as to take proper decisions (decision that do not come from fear, frustration, and so forth). But sometimes, when our delusion is too strong, our mind becomes like a suction cup grasping at the object. Taking a step back is extremely difficult. In such circumstances, I find that training in patience is the most important. In fact, it is about abandoning the eight worldly concerns, especially attachment to pleasure and aversion to pain. We are so afraid of pain that, as soon as our mind doesn't go where we want it to go, or doesn't dwell with what we want it to dwell, we try to change its course forcefully. We have the tendency to want to get rid of pain right away and that is not skilled. Ethical discipline and concentration do not come about as long as the mind is not flexible and willing, and this comes by practicing patience. So many times do we not see what is right under our nose just because we want to be some place safer. Practicing patience allows you to take a step back and it makes the mind more open and adaptable. A mind that is too rigid and forgetful does not take the context into account and therefore is not proper for taking informed decisions. 

For these reason, I concur with Andrei: try on a tourist visa. And I suggest you also give a try to the Himachal Pradesh in India. In Nepal, if you don't speak Tibetan, I believe you can study in English at the following places. I'm not entirely sure, though. 

Any being who has achieved the final true cessation is free from wandering in samsara in that he will not come back to take contaminated aggregates. Some say the body (even of an Arhat) transforms and becomes uncontaminated (and thus not samsara itself) from the time of achieving Arhatship but there is a lot of debate about this point. The Vaïbashika and Sautrantika schools further say that at the time of parinirvana, the continuum of a hearer or solitary realizer Arhat is severed (and thus no longer abides in any abode in samsara as a place), but Mahayana tenets refute such a position. 'A continuum being samsara' and 'a continuum being nirvana' are mutually exclusive. If it is one, it is not the other. In the same way, 'a room in which John is present' and 'a room in which John is absent' are mutually exclusive. Nirvana and samsara are are identical in that they are empty of inherent existence, as you and I are identical in that we are human beings. But they are not the same and one phenomena, in the same way you and I are not the same person. Samsara and nirvana do exist conventionally. This is another issue that is called 'the yoga of the equality of samsara and nirvana', sometimes phrased 'samsara is nirvana'. 

Verse 64 mentions the secret and wisdom initiations. These two initiations are taken only in the context of highest yoga tantra. Therefore, the three lower tantras are not concerned here. From the point of view of highest yoga tantra, there are two ways of achieving enlightenment:
