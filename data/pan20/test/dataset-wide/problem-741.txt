You can cut the skewer, but be sure to leave enough thread on there to keep the nut on when the QR is opened enough to take it off your bike (without having to remove the nut). Don't forget to file the sharp cut edge smooth afterwards. 

Perhaps try for a used fork. For a decent new 29er fork you're looking at Â£250+ (I estimate thats around $300) (such as rockshox reba) - or go rigid. It's sureley better than a cheap fork. 

My free hub body has cracked and im looking to replace it. I have discovered it uses a 14mm hex key to remove. I cannot find a freehub body for sale that matches m785. Will a "m760-m765" body fit my "m785" hub? 

This sort of setup is especially useful for off road/trail riding as weight is kept to a minimum and storing your heaviest items stored at the bottom of your frame bag will keep your centre of gravity low and improve handling. Something not so important in touring 

The only bad thing about the app builder is the app itself is sluggish over time (something wrong with my browser?), but it's no a big deal, since you can always save a route and refresh the page. Also, If I plan a long route, I've found strava heatmap is pretty useful , although popular routes don't always have the least elevation: $URL$ 

I've known something like this: $URL$ but I don't know this will work for casual bikes. I also agree with @reiheit, internal geared hub is much more nicer idea. An example of this is bike rental system in Taipei ($URL$ I've been in Taipei for a while, and these bikes were awesome. They had 5 speeds (If my memory is correct.). Moreover, Internally geared hub is less prone to failures, and I think the bikes require less maintenance. 

Since brake cables don't rust, I think the problem is that the cable housing gets dirty with mud or any other substances. The grit inside your housing will increase the friction so the brakes become hard to pull. A way to solve this is to prevent dirt gets inside your housing by investing in good fenders. Moreover, they will help to make the bike cleaner after a ride. Additionally, I used to lubricate the brake cables, but I found this is unnecessary ($URL$ 

I have two bikes, a hybrid commuter with skinny tyres, full mud guards & rim brakes, then I have a 29er hardtail MTB with hydraulic disc brakes and off road tyres. Which would be best, for commuting (with a minimum modification cost) in the snow? (this is likeley to be a small-medium amount of snow, perhaps having been compressed by other vehicles/walkers) 

In addition to the good answers already; Lean forward and kick your leg over the back wheel so that both feet are on one side of the bike and your standing on one pedal, then hit the ground running whilst continuing to hold the bars. Takes a little practice. Maybe it cant be done at very high speeds. 

I would reccomend against this. It only takes 10 seconds to hop on a bike and make off. Although some suggestions come to mind 

There are a lot of things you could do that would make it difficult to make a speedy getaway. Anything that would hinder you would also hinder a thief. 

You are asking about converting inner tubes to tubeless. As far as I know, tubeless system isn't 100% puncture proof, if you get a nail on the road, it's impossible to fix right away and you need to call a taxi. For me, inner tubes are still the best options for bike commuting. I can think of several ways: 

Find a comfortable saddle. Go to your LBS and ask their opinions. A lot of people suggest leather saddles, like Brooks or Selle Anatomica. A good saddle is expensive, but it is a worth upgrade and you will be surprised how big the difference is between a cheap saddle and a good one. If you are on a tight budget, a padded short is a cheaper option. Do you use a bike rack and panniers? for a long ride especially on hot weather, a set of pannier is better than a backpack. I think your current tires are already pretty good but it might be worth a try to have wider and fatter tires for more comfortable rides. I assume your current tires are 32mm wide, so upgrade to 35mm tires. 

I can appreciate that some materials are lighter than others and some have more flex than others, but overall, how do different frame materials affect handling of the bike? Assuming the same geometry and design. What are the main handling characteristics of each of the below common frame materials? 

Manufacturers will use machines to build the wheels, however on top end bikes the manufacturer will build the wheels by hand (a skilled wheel builder's work is considered better than that of a machine). Your LBS will unlikeley have a machine to build wheels and this will be done by hand. So in summary. New bike - wheel was most likeley build by machine. Repairs - wheel was almsot certainley built by hand. As @arne said. You can search youtube for "cycle wheel building machine" 

You can go as tall as you like. Have you seen those tall bikes that people must climb up a ladder to use? However practicality is another thing. As the comments have said - enough room to stand-over is a good start. Try getting a bike-fit, adjusting certain geometry (saddle hight, stem etc) may help in your circumstances. 

I have a 46cm gravel bike with 170mm crank arms (it's a Surly Cross Check, it's approximately equivalent to a 50cm road bike ). Although it isn't a MTB, it's still a 29er (700c = 29er with narrower tires). Indeed, toe overlaps are issues for me, although they are more like annoyance. Toe overlaps mostly happen when I stop at a red light, or sudden strong braking (almost completely stop) with a sharp turn. However, when I ride the bike in trails with twisty turns, at a reasonable speed, toe overlaps have never occurred. I think toe overlaps don't affect the riding performance. At first, it's quite annoying but it's not the end of the world. After a while, I'm used to it and I don't plan to modify my bike. edit: Recently I've been trying a lot of things on my bike, here's what I can tell from my experience: 

Purchase a bike pump with psi gause, so you can know precisely how much pressure the tubes have. Checking the pressure by hand isn't always the best method since I found it is hard to distinguish 30psi or 60psi on my tires. Get wider tires, for example go with 700x28mm or 700x32mm since wider tires can handle rough condition better. Some tires have kevlar protection, you can use those, but I doubt you need to purchase new tires 

I have a modern bike (ridgeback meteor '13) and It currently has a 21 speed shimano chainset. I find that going down hills (which I do a lot) and on flats I need a higher gear. Can I do anything to get a higher gear ratio (such as a bigger large chainring) or am I already at the top? Spec: 48/38/28 Chainrings 12-32 (7 Speed) Cassette: 

Bikepacking tends to be more lightweight and generally doesn't involve panniers or racks. Just look at the rigs used by tour divide riders ($URL$ If you think you need pannniers, then perhaps you are talking about touring rather than bikepacking. Bikepacking luggage will typically require one or more of the following: 

In short, you can't. I find turning my head to the side a bit reduces the noise a bit in one ear, but you can't do this all the time. A rear view cycle mirror may help you. 

One for every removeable or adjustable part on your bike (including tyres). With the exception of those you will be unable to repair/fix on the trail, such has hubs and bottom brackets. They need not all be combined with one tool though (sometimes individual tools can be lighter) 

according to the pdf document, the crankset is compatible with truvativ LE square taper BB which has JIS interface. The UN55 also have JIS. So the crankarms and the BB should be compatible, right? When I built the bike in April, I was noob so I put too much grease on the spindle. I think this was the reason why the crankarms fell off easily. That's why I didn't grease the spindle yesterday. 

Technically, it's highly possible, since you can export your routes to .gpx files and manipulate the timestamps. A .gpx file is actually an xml file which is similar to html files with tags. Each tag tells you the current longitude, latitude, and the current time stamp. You actually can edit the .gpx file with a text editor, i.e. notepad and edit the file by yourself. However, you need to know the exact long-lat where you want to "pause". 

Drop bars are possible, but you need to measure the effective top tube of your frame and the "reach" of a new drop bar you want to purchase. You didn't tell what hybrid bike you have but I assume the effective top tube on your bike is longer than ones on road bikes. Another consideration is that drop bars have additional reach forward (70-80mm). There's high a possibility that you'll need a shorter stem (< 100 mm), however, the handling might be funny (Although I've never tried this). Additionally, I assume you want to be faster. have you considered to purchase slicker/narrower tires? This solution might be less hassle and way cheaper. Being in aero position is nice but tire selection is much bigger factor to get faster, IMO. 

Depending on design, try ensuring all bolts are tightened evenly (so if the top two are done up all the way and the bottom two are not, undo them all and redo them evenly) 

I had a similar problem on my bike. The manufacturer had made the rims too deep and it was causing the tube to conform to the odd extra "U" shape when pumped up. It took a while to figure out why I was going through so many tubes. Check with your manufacturer / retailer. I got mine replaced free of charge. Perhaps your rims have an abnormality near the valve hole. 

Most components will have an instruction sheet detailing the reccomended torque. This is typically measured in Nm (newton meters). Torque wrenches can also be purchased that show you how much torque you apply. Some components even have the reccomended torque value on the component itself. Checking other components will give you an indication of the difference in required torque in relation to your BB. 

Currently, I'm little bit worried about the compatibility of my crankset and the bottom bracket. The crankset is Truvativ Isoflow, the BB is BB-UN55 (Square taper). Yesterday, after the bike hit +1400 km mark, I scheduled maintenance for the crankset. I disassemble the crank arms and the BB, cleaned them, apply grease (I use Phill Wood), and reassemble. However, when I removed the crank arms, I didn't need a crank puller at all. This made me worried that the crank arms might be loose. So what I might want is tigthen the crank bolts. However, on the drive side, the right crank arm already hit "the limit" (see an image below) so it wouldn't go any further in. To the best of my knowledge and according to this specification document, the BB should be compatible with the crankset. Its spindle width is 113mm to achieve 48.5mm chainline (The bike is a single speed), see a table on the bottomleft of the pdf document. Another solution I found on the web is not applying grease on the spindle and the crankarm holes to increase friction. This is what I did. So think the crankarms are tighter right now. So far I have no problem, no creaking noise, and I doubt the crank arms will be fall off anytime soon. However, I'm not sure whether I'll have problems in the future. edit 1: I put some more information: 

One tip I have picked up to avoid cars passing so close is to ride further away from the kerb (but not so far you're hogging the road and then drivers get annoyed). This seems to have some pycological effect on drivers to give you more room. I can't explain it, but found it to work in most cases. I have also seen bikes with mirrors fitted and some sort of plastic distance keeper (a pole that sticks out with a reflector on, I would imagine this needs to break if a car hits it.) 

You will find (usually an allen/hex key) bolt on the brake pad itself. Loosen that, align your brake pads then re-tigthen. You may also need to adjust again on the bars to get it to fit. You will also find it easier when loose and aligning them, to pull the brakes right up to the rim and tighten the bolts. Everything you need to know you will find here: $URL$
