What you say next depends on the reason for you leaving. If you're just moving on to a better job then something like: 

I've recently found myself in a very similar situation. I work in the UK and we don't have any such laws introducing, but due to a project being significantly misrepresented by a client and then under quoted by us for 9 months I was working long hours almost constantly. It led to high levels of stress and lower productivity per hour, but was necessary to complete the work. Luckily things have now quietened down and I'm working more sensible hours again, 9 - 5 with the occasional overtime. As I work for a small company I report directly to the owners of the company. One thing I found very helpful was to keep a log of exactly what I was doing in my overtime, that way my employers knew what I was doing during my working time, and what was extra. So when things returned to normal hours with less overtime they already knew what to expect in terms of output from me. As you've already done the overtime for a long period of time this is difficult to do retrospectively so what I recommend you do instead is keep a log for a few days of what you are doing during your normal office hours. It doesn't need to be an exact minute to minute log, but a general overview of how you break your day down. You can then show your manager this as a general representative of what they can expect from you during normal office hours. Explain that you've been working a lot longer, in some cases almost twice as long as the normal day over a significant period of time, which is why you've been able to produce so much more output. If you have a reasonable manager then they will be impressed with your contribution and the overtime you've put in, but will tell you to stop putting in so much as you'll burn out, which from your post it seems you are. No one can keep up that level of work for ever. If they don't then you can explain that you can't keep up that level of work and you can point to the new laws coming in that you won't be able to produce that level of work any more. Your manager is then aware of how much you have been doing and what to expect of you from now on. In summary: 

When handing it in make sure to be polite and professional. If done right your manager will probably have no idea that this is coming and may react in an unexpected fashion. No matter what happens, remain calm. If it was me, and everything was cordial between myself and my manager, then I would be saying something along the lines of this when handing in the letter: 

Keep a log for a couple of days showing a break down of your daily output. Only include work for normal office hours. Have a meeting with your manager and explain to him the situation that you've been working such long hours over the last few months. Show him your log and explain this is what you normally do during office hours, anything extra over the last months has been overtime. Explain that you cannot keep putting in so many hours, both due to the new laws coming in and your own health / other reasons. Tell him you're worried about the impact the reduced work coming from you may look like to him. 

It isn't your place to do anything about this. Your manager will manage his time according to his boss and himself. If it's not affecting you then you shouldn't say anything. If it is affecting you, for example he hasn't made a decision on which way a project should go, politely ask him for a decision and state that your work is being held up by the lack of a decision. If his queries are impacting on your work then you should point out to him how it is impacting and the right tools / libraries to use to avoid impacting on you in the future, focus on the way for him to stop impacting your work and you might just find he realises he's a bit out of touch and stops on his own. However if he wants to run those queries rather than delegate then that's his right as the Manager. If it's such a big problem then find another job (and mention why you're leaving in your exit interview), or find a way to become a manager on the same level as him (if that's possible) and then you can talk to him as a colleague rather than your boss. 

Look at what your the Job you are applying for requires and then try to apply the above technique to as many points as possible. Show them that whilst you lack professional experience, you have transferable skills. Everyone has transferable skills to some degree. It's recognising these and expounding your virtues to your future employer 

Whether you realise it or not, you have experience. Perhaps not commercial and professional experience but you will have life experiences that you can relate to professional experiences. One way to show you are aware of what is required to work in a team environment (often something employers look for in graduates) is to apply real world experiences of where you worked in a team. Did you have a job before where you worked with others? Have you ever played a team sport in high school / university? Have you taken part in team building exercises, perhaps at summer camps? Relating any / all of these to working within a team in a professional environment will impress. An example of how to put this to a potential employer is: 

In my opinion I wouldn't recommend you write the email but just concentrate on doing the best possible job on the coding assignment. Why? I shall explain below. I recently interviewed and hired a new developer for my team, and you can tell when someone is nervous. In my experience as both interviewer and interviewee, the interviewers will take nerves into account. Almost everyone I interviewed showed nerves to some degree. They've already told you a second round of interviews will be necessary if you do well on the coding assignment, so don't worry about what has happened as you can't change that; worry about what you can change and that's how well you do in the next bit. 

Don't use a sign. No matter how you word it it's going to give a negative impression of you and will come across as passive aggressive. How senior are the people who meet there? Is it colleagues, your immediate managers colleagues or more senior staff? If it's senior staff then the best thing you can do is put up with it or ask your line manager if you can move desk. If it's staff members more or less on the same level as you then speak to your line manager about the practice and how it disrupts you. They may well suggest you move, or they may have a word with people and ask them not to stand there. Alternatively you could ask if any of your colleagues minds switching desks with you. Unless you have assigned desks I doubt any manager will mind if you swap desks with someone. 

Those two can help you cover most situations. If you'd like help with any specific situation leave a comment. 

I guess the real answer to this is how important to this is you and how far are you willing to go over it? Any answer depends on the answer to those two questions. As you've previously tried to address this but been rebuffed then it goes to show that you may have to make a firm stand to get anywhere with this, and in doing so put some backs up. Be prepared for the consequences of that. That being said you've mentioned company policy is on your side. It's important to come across as professional and seeking to resolve and issue, and not being petty or greedy. You will need a delicate touch to see this through, though at times you may feel that you're being anything but delicate. Firstly I would recommend speaking with your manager about the issues you're having surrounding the extra responsibilities being asked of you. Explain how you feel in a polite, professional and detached manner. Back up your statements with facts, such as the company policy and your employment contract. From there you can either ask for your job title to be expanded to encompass the additional work you're being asked to do with suitable remuneration or have the work passed on to the suitable parties. Be prepared to be flexible on this issue. Everyone, regardless of company policy, is expected to help pull their weight in the office. That's my experience anyway. It may be that no-one is officially responsible for the work that is being done and your manager is trying to simply get the necessary work done with the resources he's been given. You can't be expected to do more than you're contracted to, but if you stick to that attitude you won't get far in any job. It's those who go above and beyond who are favourably looked upon in the next reviews. When the time comes for bonuses and promotions, how hard you've worked compared to your colleagues often determines who gets what. If you're standing your ground and only working what your contract says you need to do then well done, you'll have made your point, but it will be your colleagues who have gone above and beyond who will be getting the bonuses and promotions. 

Honesty is the best policy when it comes to your CV. Always list every job you've worked, never list more than you've done. Most employers will forgive someone for not getting it right with their first job. The fact that you're fresh out of school will help you there as you don't have the life experience in the working world that helps you identify the warning signs that a job isn't a good fit for you. Other things that can help are if you're applying for jobs that are in the same field. It shows you're committed to your chosen career, you just don't like working where you are at the moment. Know why you're leaving; do you not like it because of the work? What specific thing(s) is it that you don't like about your current job? Then prepare to answer the question of why you're leaving so soon in interview. Whatever you do, don't bash your current employer. No one likes to hear someone gripe about how bad they have it, or how unfair something is. Be professional and keep it short and relevant. If you'd like an example of what to say please let us know specifically what it is that you don't like about your current place. 

In your situation I'd have asked for time to ask references permission before filling them out on site. I'm sure they would have been fine with that. However now you've already given the list, I'd start calling people and asking them if they mind, as if I hadn't already given the list. Most people will say yes, and with a little luck all of your references will say yes. Then if they're contacted they never need know that you gave their name before they said yes. If they say no then you're in a bit of a situation. You should apologise and explain what happened, that you had to give references before you had a chance to ask them. At worst if called they may decline to be a reference. 

Simply be honest with your boss. He should respect that. Just say to him that whilst you're fine chatting with him when you happen to bump into him you don't feel comfortable in mixing your personal and professional lives. Anyone who is reasonable will accept that and simply move on. There's no need for it to be a big deal. Just make sure to be polite when you are talking with him and keep it focused on the fact that you want to keep the relationships separate. 

I would handle this as a one off if you're OK with it being a one off. Don't try and assume that your manager will make a habit of it and head off something that might not be. You'll just end up making an awkward situation. Simply be the helpful employee willing to accept this one off meeting. If it happens again then you can head it off, but only if it happens again, and it needn't be awkward or difficult. Your manager can't expect you to be available for work commitments outside of work hours, so don't make yourself available. Just say you have other commitments; you don't even have to specify what these are, you just aren't available that evening. If you keep making yourself unavailable in the evenings your manager will very quickly get the message. 

I don't see why not. Your paid by XYZ, you do work for XYZ and if you ever needed a reference it would be provided by XYZ. As long as if anyone ever asked if you were full time employed or not, you specified that you were a self-employed contractor, currently working under contract for XYZ then there's no harm. You're not deliberately misrepresenting yourself because as you mention, there are no options on Facebook, LinkedIn or other social media to say that you are a contractor rather than a full time employee. I think the only exception to this would be if XYZ saw that you had put your employment status as working for XYZ on your social media and asked you to change this. Why they would though I can't imagine.
