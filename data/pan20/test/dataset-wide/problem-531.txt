Shimano 9 speed has a different pull ratio to 10 speed. So this wouldn't be possible. If your Tiagra is the newer 4700 series - the cabling is routed under the tape - which gives a cleaner line but I found on my Shimano 5700 105 (vs the older 5600 external routing) gave a stiffer shift. I have found on servicing my cables with lubed and sealed Jagwire - the shifting has improved greatly though. 

I've done my motorcycle test and know all about defensive riding techniques - and you apply it no matter what bike you are riding. I ride both rim and disc brake bicycles on my winter training and on my commuter bike. On the winter bike I have swapped out the pads to a softer compound for better braking performance (but not so good for longevity). Even with this change - I often find wanting for more power on descents or rapid & predictable braking in wet conditions. My commuter bike has discs (Avid BB5) - and the braking in the wet is significantly better - I also feel safer in that I know I can stop reliably in any conditions. The downside is the weight - it doesn't sound like much but it doesn't translate into a performance ride. Which is why I have to maintain a winter training bike for club and group rides and a commuter for solo rides to work. And remember - your brakes are only as good as the rubber contact patch under your wheels. So decent tyres and a half-decent width - I'd say 25mm minimum or better still 28mm if you have the clearance. 

Garmin 510 uses ANT+ to communicate to the add-on devices. I would remove and re-pair the devices first to see if they are actually seeing each other first. The speed and cadence sensor should pair as a single device and not speed and cadence separately. 

1) Check the rear quick release is on tight. A lose rear quick release can cause clicking issues / noises from the bottom bracket. 2) Check the tightness of the chainring bolts. Make sure they are tight. Some alloy chainring bolts will cause clicks as the chainset is placed under strain on hard efforts. 3) Your bottom bracket is worn or loose? Check the fitting is flush and tight. Check if the bearings still feel smooth when turning the chainset. A press-fit BB should be dry-fit. A threaded BB should be greased. 

You are 78% of the way there already. Air is 78% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, 2% other gases. Therefore, the difference gained in using pure nitrogen is going to be minimal. And accurately gauging air pressure will be tricky. 

You mention the brake is brand new. Have you "bedded" the pads in? Bedding involves riding down a hill and feathering the brake lightly. The other possibility is pad / disc contamination. In particular oil. Discs can be cleaned with appropriate solvent. Pads can be cleaned by baking (faced down) on grease proof paper or gently heating over a flame to burn off the residue. 

I also have a windows phone but not on the latest version 10 OS - so cannot install or comment on the Garmin Connect app. The closest app to Strava is something called Striver. It saves GPX to the phone and for seamless integration and upload to Strava - you have to pay a small fee for the app. If I am out for a quick ride of 1hr to 1.5hrs my phone is fine to record the ride but I tuck the phone in my jersey pocket with the screen locked - so the power drain is not too bad. The problems I have seen with other riders who have tried using their phone as a GPS device has been battery power. Longer rides completely drain their phones - which is not ideal in case of emergency. Battery drainage will also be exasperated with bluetooth usage for cadence & heart-rate measurement too. Other considerations 

Not mentioned is rim width - which is just as critical as the issue of wider tyres. A wider tyre on a narrow rim provides comfort and grip but not a lower rolling resistance. I think this was measured in a recent issue of Cyclist magazine (UK). Manufacturers are now producing rims which are in the range or 21-23mm external width. With a wide rim ie 23mm you could run a 23mm tyre and still benefit from lower rolling resistance. 

I like Morten's answer. It covers a lot of ground. A power meter these days - is the de facto tool to train with. They have dropped a lot in price over recent years - but still expensive - if you are just starting out. And like any tool has to be used in the correct way (training). You can still get away with using a heart rate monitor - and they are useful for longer efforts but for shorter efforts and overall data quality / accuracy - a power meter is an investment. Incidentally, I don't own or train with a power meter. The most important factor you need to decide is how much time you can dedicate to training on a consistent basis - week to week. Once you know this - you can formulate a training plan to suit. If you are short of time - say 4 -5 hours a week - then your plan will probably bias towards intervals. If you have 8 - 9 hours a week - then your plan can shift towards longer rides to build an endurance base with less bias on intervals. But whatever, consistency would be the key. Also set realistic goals. 80km on a 0.2% gradient at 35km/h - does this look realistic? It's a theoretical 4.2W/kg over 2hrs!! $URL$ 

20 miles in 50mins each way? I make that an avg of 24mph going as you describe "fairly easy pace" on a hybrid bike. That's impressive. It's almost not worth buying a car. But on a serious note - if you are "not really fit" - I would suggest your times or distance are wrong. It takes a good few weeks (3 to 4) to get used to that kind of distance with that kind of regularity. Persevere with it and your legs will build some serious strength. You'll also burn off any excess weight. Recommend clip-in pedals and decent cycling shoes. Pack for all-weather - ie. a decent packable rain jacket, waterproof shoe covers. Decent lights. CO2 cannister for punctures - you might want to "slime" your tubes for added puncture resistance. Keep at it.
