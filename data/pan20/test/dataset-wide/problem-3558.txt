It's very possible for you to drop the ~12 kg's that you need to in order to reach your ideal weight. However, fat loss is best and most effectively accomplished when an increase in exercise is combined with a decrease in calories. While you exercise once or maybe twice a day, you will be eating more often, so it's important to be conscious of what you are eating. Since there isn't any info about what you eat, I'll leave the diet part alone for now, and address your other questions. The exercise and calorie burn you get from running outside is the same as running inside the gym on a treadmill. However, because most cardio machines keep track of calories burned, it could make the case that it would be a more efficient way of losing the amount of calories you need to in order to reach your goal weight. So unless you have a way of counting calories burned while out on a run, the gym machines would make it easier to know when you've reached a goal amount of total calories burned for that session. Not sure how many calories is enough to lose for one session? Lets go over an example to give you an idea of what you do could do to try and accomplish your weight loss goal. There are around 7,500 calories in one kilogram, and to get to your goal weight you want to lose 12 kilograms. If through exercise and diet, you can eliminate 200 - 500 calories a day, it will take in between 1 - 1.5 months to burn 2 kilograms. If you can maintain that calorie burn for 6 - 9 months, you will reach your goal in under a year which is awesome! As for exercises to help you lose weight, the exercises that work the most body parts will burn the most calories. If you have access to a gym, lifting weights would certainly aid helping you lose weight, but if your not into weights, there are lots of body weight exercises you can do to keep yourself in shape and looking good. Examples include: mountain climbers, push ups, burpees, planks, lunges, leg raises, and tons more you can check out here: $URL$ While you exercise, you want to keep your heart rate elevated to maximize calorie burn, so aim for at least 15 repetitions each time you complete an exercise. To take it to another level, create whats called a giant set, and complete several exercises back to back to back. Walking is a good way to lose fat, but its not a very intense exercise, so the calorie loss won't be as big, as when you are completing other, more exhausting exercises. Fat loss can be a very rewarding goal to fulfill, and you'll get as much out of it, as you put into it. However, it's not exactly an easy goal to fulfill, so if it takes a while before you find a routine that works for you and your hectic life, don't stress, just know that with hard work and dedication, you can look anyway you want to look. 

1) The physical structure of your personal bones pushes you to use the inner or outer hamstrings more than the other. 2) Faulty motor recruitment due to an inability to feel your hamstring muscles working. To improve motor recruitment, vary the (isolation) exercises you use to target the hamstrings. Hamstring exercises can be divided into 4 categories depending on the angle in which the muscle is working. - The first are exercises that bring the feet toward the butt (ex: lying and standing leg curls) - The second are exercises that lift the torso (ex: dead lifts and good mornings) - The third are exercises that contract the upper part of the hamstring and stretch the lower part (ex: sliding lunges) - The fourth are exercises that stretch the upper part and contract the lower part (ex: seated leg curls) The book also mentions that by changing the position of your feet, you can try and change the recruitment of your hamstrings. By turning your feetoutward, it will involve the biceps femoris more, and inward will work the semi muscles. It also recommends to warm up your hamstrings before doing compound exercises for the legs (such as squats) as working cold hamstrings can cause pain in the knees and back during the exercises. I also wanted to note that by doing more squats, you will only compound the problem at hand. Your only repeating something that isn't working for you and expecting it to create different results, which no offense, but according to Einstein, would be considered crazy. Now a final summary of everything: Compound exercises target and work more muscles than isolation exercises, and allow more weight to be used per exercise, making them essential for a muscle building program. However, because they recruit multiple joints and muscle groups, the possibility of a one muscle group taking over and doing more of the work is very, very real. By including isolation exercises, you can bring up lagging muscle groups so that when you return to the essential compound lifts, the muscle imbalance is gone, which results in more weight lifted. Additionally, isolation exercises are less exhausting which means you'll be less tired after doing them, compared to compounds. Finally, they can also help you learn to develop a feel for working that muscle, meaning you'll be able to recruit it later on. Hopefully now you can see there is no "harm" in including isolation exercises in your own training program. If I was unclear at all, please let me know.

Myfitness Pal is a smartphone app and website that allows you to count calories in and out via exercise. Its not something to be used as an EXACT number of calories in and out, but it will give you an idea of how the things and amounts of things you have been eating, contribute to how you now look and feel. I left a link to the homepage of Myfitness pal below. Pay attention to how you look in the mirror. Its very easy to be biased in a situation like this, but try to honestly take inventory of how you look compared to how you have looked before. To avoid making this subjective, look for objective sings that your making weight loss progress, for example, are you more vascular? does your skin seem/look tighter? 

The stimulus that the leg press provides is difficult to replicate for the same reason that it has become a hassle for you, it allows for a lot of weight to be used. As mentioned by Berin, the weight you use for the leg press will greatly differ from the weight used on most other leg exercises. This makes it a hard exercise to replicate in terms of muscle stimulus, however there are many other great exercises to build the same muscles that the leg press builds, the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves. Here are 3 of those exercises, along with video demonstrations of them, several research-based tips for getting the most out of them, and alternative ways you could continue to include the leg press in your routine, should you find that you simply need it in your life. Lunges - As shown by study 1, forward lunges have been found to strengthen and build the quadriceps, hamstrings, and even part of your calf. Done with either a barbell on your back, or holding dumbbells at your side, the lunge can be a great substitute for the leg press. To get a closer look at the exercise performed in action, check out this link $URL$ Study 1: $URL$ Squats - Most lifters will agree that the barbell back squat is a contender for the title of Most Physically Brutal and Exhausting Exercise Ever. Berin already mentioned squats so I won't talk it about them much more, I'll just leave you with another example video of the exercise being performed: $URL$ , And I'll mention that when squatting, avoid throwing in the BOSU ball, or any other unstable surface that forces you to balance on top of it. While it makes sense to believe that squatting on an uneven surface would make the exercise even more challenging, rewarding, and even "exciting", it has unsurprisingly been shown (in study 2) to greatly reduce the amount of weight able to be lifted, which is a large contributor to muscle and strength growth. This makes squatting on an uneven surface more suitable for a rehabilitation program, than a strength training program. To mix it up, you could substitute front squats with back squats, as both offer different advantages and stimulus. Study 2: $URL$ Goblet Squat The weight used to perform the goblet squat will be marginal compared to what you use on your leg press, however the goblet squat has the benefits of reinforcing proper squatting form, and is especially helpful if you deal with any ankle, or wrist flexibility problems. And of course, here's the video demonstration. $URL$ 

Enemy is a strong word, and carbohydrates can be a great fuel source for athletes and those engaged in any training program. However, as the saying goes, Too much of a good thing... When you take a bite of something that contains carbohydrates, the carbs will eventually convert to blood glucose (blood sugar). A high level of blood sugar can be toxic, so the body, not wanting to die, tells the pancreas to release a hormone called insulin to direct the sugar in the blood to hungry cells, where it is stored as glycogen. A problem results however, when too many carbs are eaten because cells can only hold so much glycogen. After a while they start flipping insulin the bird, telling it that they don't want any more blood sugar directed to them. Insulin is persistent however, and refuses to take no for an answer, so it continues to try harder and harder (releases more and more insulin) to get the blood sugar into the cells. Once cells are fully and begin ignoring insulin, they are whats called insulin resistant and this not only is a hindrance to fat loss goals, but can eventually lead to diabetes. Additionally, when insulin is released, you are not as efficient at burning fat. The solution, is to mix in lower carbohydrate days with normal, and higher ones. By keeping the carb intake a variable, your system wont constantly be flooded with insulin and you'll become more of what's called insulin sensitive, which means your cells are welcoming insulin and you are running efficiently. Resistance training has also been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, so including that could help increase your fat loss efforts in multiple ways, as well. 

For advice on recovery, I felt a physical therapist is really the person you should be asking, so I found a youtube video of one, talking about how to treat the exact problem it seems like you have now. I want to also add that by switching to an underhand grip or supinated grip to perform your back exercises, you put the biceps in a stronger position, which means you won't be recruiting your brachioradialis as much. Wishing you a speedy recovery! 

As time goes on and you continue evaluating yourself, continue to tweak your calorie levels according to how you look, and how you want to look. Note - Calorie counting isn't a necessary part of losing weight, but it is an extremely useful one. If you can keep track of your diet mentally then feel free to not count a single calorie. However, keeping track of food choices and quantities can without a doubt help you learn more about how your diet and body composition work together. 

To start, if you notice that you feel pain rather than a burn or soreness in your hamstrings, it may have to do with your squat stance, rather than lagging hamstrings. However, the hamstrings are more often underdeveloped compared to their quad counterparts found in front of them for most trainee's, so a muscle imbalance isn't out of the question. And while explaining proper squat form doesn't organically relate to the rest of your questions, I am just mentioning this because while the squat can be absolutely draining and downright brutal, it shouldn't feel painful. To understand how and if isolation exercises should be implemented into your training program, I'll go over the advantages and disadvantageous of them compared to compound exercises. But first, what is an isolation exercise? Isolation Exercises include all exercises or movements that affect only one joint. For example, the movement of the bicep curl involves only the elbow joint as the forearm move over the arm, making it an effective isolation exercises for the biceps. Now, as for why and why not you'd want to include them in your own training. Why Not 

Your biceps like to provide assistance when performing exercises for the back, however if you use a pronated grip (or overhand grip)to do your back exercises it puts the biceps in a weaker position to help out. This forces the brachioradialis muscle, to pick up the slack and aid in assisting the bigger muscle group working. The brachioradialis muscle is located on the upper, outer part of your forearm, and based on the grip you said you used, and your exercise selection, and pain felt afterwards, it sounds like you could potentially have suffered a strain in it. You mentioned you just got back into doing pullups, so your brach muscles probably aren't used to this type of exercise stimulus. That said, in the short term doing more pull ups or other "such activities" wouldn't help the problem, it will just increase the strain on the muscles. Long term, doing more and more pullups will strengthen those muscles, but just make sure you don't push too hard and cause any injuries. Other ways to strengthen the brachioradialis:
