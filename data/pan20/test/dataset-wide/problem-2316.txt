I'm reminded of a drill that Steven Jeffrey (a relatively famous route-setter) would take new setters through. This can also be a good mental exercise to run through when setting. He would have them initially set a ~V8 route and critique it. Then, having committed to that particular movement and set of bolt holes, they would have to turn their problem into a V3 by only changing out holds and not the location of the holds. If this proved impossible, then it means that the original v8 contained a shut-down move that was height dependent and therefore was a bad problem for the gym. 

If the establishment is unwilling to alter their practices, I would strongly urge you to contact the manufacturers of the ropes. Having worked specialty outdoor retail, this would be the sort of thing that a reputable manufacturer would drop a dealer for. 

Going straight to the source, here's a Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Mace brand pepper spray (note that bear spray is high concentration, high volume pepper spray). Here's a snip of the relevant section: The particular first aid recommendations are: 

While watching the Ladies' Olympic Snowboarding Halfpipe in Pyeongchang, I noticed what appeared to be straps around the lower leg of each competitor. For example, here's a couple pictures of American champion Chloe Kim with said straps indicated: 

This dimension is know as the binding stack height (as well as binding stand height) and can be both beneficial and detrimental: 

Personally, I'll deal with purifying my water (and bringing hand sanitizer!) in order to not deal with diarrhea while backpacking. 

Belayer lowers climber to next highest anchor. This may require the climber to "tram" along the rope on steeply overhanging routes. Climber securely connects to anchor. On a project route, you would likely have a couple carabiners left at the intermediate anchor for just this purpose. Belayer disconnects from the rope. !Make sure the climber is safe first! Climber pulls the rope, either by: 1) Pulling from the climber end, taking the belayer end all the way through the top anchor, which then hopefully falls to the ground for the belayer. 2) The climber unties, pulls the the belayer side of the rope such that the climber end goes up to the top anchor and back down to the climber at the intermediate anchor. This method is generally easier. Regardless of how the rope was pulled, the climber threads the intermediate anchor, the belayer puts them back on, and the belayer lowers the climber. Repeat if necessary. 

This piece of advice is commonly given to new routesetters, and should generally be taken as a reminder of best practices rather than scientific dogma. For example, 

You can repeat this exercise for almost any famous climbing area with feared projects and find similar distributions of route difficulty. Those closest I've been able to find to an exception is Rifle, CO. Even at this famed paradise for 5.13 climbers, there still 56 5.10s and 25 routes 5.9 and under: 

Some people have even been known to just clip into the quickdraw and not bother with the extra hijinx of connecting the the belayer side with a locker. Regardless of whether this step is done or not, there will be a least a couple moments where the climber is hanging off a single bolt and a single carabiner. This breaks one of the cardinal rules (never trust your life to a single piece of gear), but new bolts in sound rock and quickdraws are usually pretty strong and... If you can't see why this is extremely dangerous for yourself, don't ever try it. Option Free Solo Belayer While not directly applicable to the routes mentioned, the following can often be quite useful. This would generally apply to a route where just an extra 5-10m of rope are necessary to get the climber down from hanging in free space and the route starts with easy terrain (say 10m of 4th/easy 5th before the route steepens). 

Ay-yi-yi! This is a very broad question, a true answer to which would probably require a PhD in hydrodynamics or years of relevant engineering expertise. Note that the interplay between these design characteristics can be very complex and depend greatly on the exact conditions (flat water / waves / moving water / rapids / ..., skill of paddler, travel speed, ...). Furthermore, there are many, many, many other design characteristics that could be considered (freeboard / keel / bow shape / hydro-planing / ergonomics / ...), as well as considering that the hull shape varies over the length of the boat. All that being said, here's a very rough guideline. Reverse Engineering Much can be learned by comparing images of modern boats and considering the intended design. In comparing the general hull shapes, let's try to reverse engineer the design. 

Now that we have a handful of actual boat shapes, let's look at each of this hull characteristics in turn. Assume that we are tweaking each of these parameters in isolation (i.e., all else being equal), along with many other disclaimers. Plan: A longer, narrower plan will generally result in less hydrodynamic drag (particularly dependent on the bow shape). It will also generally track straighter, but at the cost of reduced lateral stability and more difficulty turning. In comparison, a short wide plan would easier to turn and more stable, but give more drag and be slower. Cross Section: A flat bottom will provide the most lateral stability (and usable interior space), but will have a harder time tracking straight. It will also "skid" or "pivot" turns, unless actively tilted on edge. A rounded bottom will be easier to tip from side to side, which can be beneficial in a kayak. It will behave somewhere in between a flat bottom and a hard chine, depending on how rounded it is. The "vee or hard chine" cross section will generally track straight, as it has somewhat of a keel effect. This shape also has a secondary balance point when the boat is tipped on its side, allowing it to "carve" turns (this is how you turn a sea kayak, for example). On the flip side, this shape is difficult to turn in place. Rocker For rocker, we need to consider how much of the boat is in contact with the water (freeboard vs. beam, etc.). A more pronounced rocker will 

In addition to Felix's excellent answer of what should be done it practice, it is well worth knowing how to pass a knot in the rope (whether while rappelling or hauling). This will generally be more time consuming than just having an extra length of rope for which to affect the rescue and it should be noted that the knots that were tied to add friction on the lip of the crevasse during the fall will also add friction during the haul back out, perhaps becoming completely jammed up on the lip. As this is a standard self-rescue technique, I'll give a brief overview of how this might look for a typical 3:1 z-drag setup. The additional gear requirements are minimal, needing only an extra sling/prusik and two carabiners. Always obtain professional instruction 

Keep in mind that all of these distributions were simply the number of routes by grade in the database, not the total number of ascents per grade. If we looked at a plot of number of ticks vs grade, we would expect all of these distributions to shift dramatically to the left. 

All images from screencaps of the NBC Olympics stream, available at $URL$ I am having trouble determining what exactly these are. My thoughts are: 

For variation on this approach, see the following technical bulletin from Petzl: Crevasse Hauling on a Rope with Knots. While illustrated with a Micro-traxion and a tibloc, the same procedure works with prusiks as well. It proceeds much in the same manner for steps 1 and 2, but then uses an extra sling to connect the hauling prusik to the anchor (shown in green): 

For a sofshell/fleece hybrid jacket example, here's the Outdoor Research Centrifuge jacket (image from outdoorresearch.com): As an additional suggestion, why not use similar jackets that you already have from the biking world? No need to buy the same gear twice! 

If you only have a couple extra items, say approach shoes and a headlamp, just have everyone clip them to their harnesses. Have the follower climb with a small pack. A small lightweight pack or stripping down a climbing pack (remove top lid / framesheet / waistbelt) will work; clipping the waistbelt around the rear of the backpack can do wonders for making climbing and accessing harness gear loops easier. Consider keeping a few items clipped to the leader's harness to share the load. This works if you need, say, a couple liters of water, a few bars, headlamps, and a thin jacket each. Have a small leader's pack and larger follower's pack, perhaps by having a water bottle, headlamp, and jacket in each pack, with extra layers and shoes in the followers pack. Resort to hauling a pack or haulbag. A method of last resort as this ups the complexity and time taken, but can be necessary if the climbing is truly difficult. One special circumstance would be a route that is generally reasonable to climb with a pack, but features a crux off-width/chimney pitch. Rather than struggling to climb this one pitch with packs, consider hauling a pack through this section. It will definitely be more enjoyable and might even be faster. 

Pull on the hauling system to release tension on the braking mechanism (whether micro-traxion or prusik), and then allow the rope to slide back through the system until the weight of the climber is taken up by the green sling. With this newly introduced slack, untie the knot (or pass it by extending the pulley at the anchor), then haul again until the green sling is slack and can be removed. 

The one shortcoming I find reading through many of the other answers is that they seem to skip over a major source of pollutants in backcountry streams: human waste. While you might not be downstream of a cattle feedlot, there's a chance that a human (or other animal) took a dump just upstream from you. Doubly so if you've been hiking along an established trail. For example, here's a USGS study. While not particularly far into the backcountry, both of these creeks would objectively appear to be pristine, swift moving mountain streams. Pay particular attention to the bit about "fecal coliforms" and keep in mind that there are more people in the backcountry than there were 20 years ago... 

Discussing the why's and when's of this technique is beyond the scope of an answer. Seriously, being near a cornice is a great way to get killed. The takeaway is that you can "safely" drop cornices that would be too large to just stomp with a ski, and do it much more quickly and with less gear than carrying a dedicated cord/cable. That being said, the primary benefit of being able to attach a snow saw to a ski pole or probe is to make cutting the back of a column easier in a snow pit (RB and ECT in particular), particularly if there are stiff layers / crusts in your snow profile. 

The first answer that comes to mind: presumably your climbing partner didn't drop their belay device at the same time? It would be astronomically rare for both belay/rappel devices to be dropped at the same time. As such, lower the first climber (something you've already practiced almost every time you've been out climbing). The second climber then rappels as normal, taking extra care not to chuck their device as well. This may seem like a total smart-alec response, but make sure you haven't exhausted all the easy alternatives in an emergency before you go mucking about with "I think I saw how to do this on the internet once." When was the last time you actually practiced rappelling with a carabiner brake or Dulfersitz? That being said, every climber should absolutely practice self-rescue techniques (including the Munter Hitch and others). 

Occasionally, on overhanging routes where the ground slopes away from the base of the route, the climber doesn't need to untie, but rather just walk uphill back to the base of the route as the belayer downclimbs / gets lowered as a counter-weight. Research & Development Option One product scheduled to hit the market in 2018 is the Beal Escaper, additional video and commentary. The device connects to the anchor and then one end of your rope is tied to it. After doing a full length, single strand rappel, simply do ten hard tugs and everything comes falling down to you. Shades of Samwise Gamgee and his elven rope. Seems simultaneously fascinating and terrifying. The main utility would seem to be multipitch routes, where an entire second rope (an extra 5-10lbs) has to be carried up the route just to use as a tag line for rappelling off. In the context of the original question, this would still require the climber to a) get lowered and secure into an intermediate anchor; b) pull the rope through after being taken off bely; c) either tag up or carry along a belay device and the Beal Escaper. As this isn't scheduled to hit the market until the end of 2018, it hasn't undergone "real world" testing. On a first pass, it seems absolutely terrifying and prone to many "what if?" scenarios. On the other hand, Beal is a well respected brand and they would have to have tested it extensively before even thinking of selling such a product commercially... Canyoneering-World Options Moving well outside the realm of the question, you can look to the canyoneering world for inspiration on how to do long rappels with a minimal amount of gear. For that community, they aspire to "ghosting": traveling down a canyon leaving absolutely no gear behind (not even a sling around a tree or, heaven forbid, a bolted anchor). They make the sketchy anchors used while alpine climbing seem OSHA approved in comparison. For examples, there are things like the Imlay Canyon Gear Fiddlestick (video) for retrieving a rope with only a tiny pull cord after a full length rappel, or the SandTrap which is effectively a tarp that you fill with sand, rappel off of, and then use a pull cord on one corner to dump all the sand out of and send everything down to you. Again, great ways to make rappelling even more dangerous and not applicable to the tame world of sport climbing. 

Route Information If possible, try to avoid carrying an entire guidebook up the route with you. Some options include taking a picture of the route description with a digital camera, photocopying the relevant pages, studying the route beforehand and committing the description and topo to memory, and even ripping the relevant pages out. This will also depend on the nature of the route, e.g., line of bolts vs trad route with intricate route finding. So how do I carry all this crap? Well, it depends on how much crap you're taking with you! From least amount of extra gear to most, the options would be 

An Alternate Viewpoint In some sense, indoor gyms should take their cues from outdoor climbing. While the insane mega-projects stand out more sharply in our memory, the typical route at the typical climbing destination isn't truly that hard. Mountain Project offers a breakdown by grade (not even total number of ticks at each grade) for each climbing area in its database. For example, you may have heard of the Dawn Wall in Yosemite. However, most routes in Yosemite are not 5.14d: 

There are two main schools of thought: the "fast and light" / "light is right" / "rope, rack, shirt on your back" camp and the "be prepared" / "safety first" crowd. When taken to extremes, blindly following either ethos can lead to trouble. Like most everything in the mountains, it comes down to experience on similar routes, judgement, acceptable risk tolerances and even willingness to suffer. However, these are some of the things I consider when racking up at the base of the climb: The Descent Will you rappel straight back down the route when finished, or is there a long walk-off descent? If rappelling, then there is usually little need to take your approach shoes up the route with you. If there is a walk-off, then you will most likely need to take your shoes up the route with you (note that some walk-offs are not necessarily unreasonable to do barefoot, provided they are relatively short and have reasonably non-jagged / non-pokey terrain). Shoes are usually dealt with by simply clipping them off a rear gear loop on your harness---note that having lightweight, low top approach shoes or trail runners instead of high top hiking boots will make this much less annoying. How long will the route take? Neither routes nor climbing parties are created equal. Leading at your limit might take upwards of an hour for a single pitch, while a strong climber might lead the exact same pitch in fifteen minutes. More than almost any factor, the amount of time you spend off the ground and away from your pack will dictate what you take with on the route. For an extreme example, Alex Honnold soloed Freerider in under 4 hours, while a more average party would probably take a portaledge. Be realistic in your estimates, and don't forget to account for time spent at belays getting racked up for the next pitch. One rule of thumb would be to figure between sixty and ninety minutes to lead and follow a pitch for a party climbing a route that is within their abilities (but not trivially easy) with good rope management and organization at belays. Tack on some extra time if climbing with a party of three. Are you climbing with a longer rope / willing to simul-climb short sections in order to link pitches? Are you comfortable running it out over easier terrain, or do you like to sew pitches up, frequently placing gear? Does the route have complicated route-finding and require building gear anchors at hanging belays, or is there a line of bolts leading to a bolted anchor on a ledge? Is the route a straightforward jug haul/hand crack, or is it delicate slab climbing? Don't forget to account for descent time! Doubly so if the descent is intricate. If it starts getting dark or weather starts building, do you have the margin to accelerate your pace and quickly fire the rest of the route, or is the climbing difficult and already at your limit? How committing is the route? Is the route easy to retreat off? If it gets towards dusk, can you just pull the plug and rap back down to the ground off of fixed anchors? Or is the only feasible way off the route to top it out and take a walk off descent? How long until dark? One of the absolute easiest pieces of gear to take up a multipitch route is a small headlamp. A bad situation can become truly epic, if not fatal, in the dark. Rappelling into the darkness towards an unknown anchor is a nightmare and the type of mistake you generally don't repeat. A headlamp is easily carried by either clipping or girth hitching it to a gear loop. Some truly small headlamps (e.g., the Petzl e-LITE) can even stash neatly in a pants pocket or the zippered pocket found on some chalk bags. What's the climbing like? The nature of the route can make a large impact on how much extraneous gear you're willing to take up a route---off-widths and chimneys are annoying with a mess of extra gear clipped off your harness and downright frustrating with a backpack. While this can be somewhat mitigated by intelligent racking or clipping a backpack off a sling to trail behind you, it is an annoyance that is best avoided if at all possible. In contrast, a 5.7 hand crack or ridge scramble might be almost as easy with a pack on. What's the weather like? Even though it is currently a sunny day, always keep in mind that the weather could (probably?) change. Red Rocks, Nevada, is infamous for winds that come whipping down the canyons in the evening and the Rocky Mountains commonly generate afternoon thunderstorms on days that start with clear skies. Will you have a clear view of approaching weather? Would you be able to retreat if you see darkening skies? If the weather did turn, would it just mean being a little bit cold and wet, or would it be an emergency without extra layers? Consider slightly overdressing, e.g., wearing technical fabrics, pants instead of shorts, and perhaps even an unzipped thin jacket. While it might be overkill if the weather stays nice, it can make the difference if there is inclement weather. Some wind / rain jackets can stuff into a pocket and have a carabiner loop for clipping it to your harness; you can also find a small stuff sack for the same purpose. Alternatively, you can tie a jacket around your waist---make sure to tie a good knot and "twist" the jacket up to avoid having a large flap of fabric in your way. Food and Water Try to tank up on water and eat a snack before starting a route in order to minimize on the amount you need to take with. Snacks can easily be stashed in pockets, while a water bottle is usually clipped of a rear gear loop (soft-sided water bottles are quite nice for this). Make sure that you're clipping into something structural on a water bottle---that strip of plastic on a classic Nalgene bottle is just a leash to keep you from dropping the lid. Consider whether you will be climbing in the shade or sun and how hot and dry of a day it is (remember that these can change over the course of the day!). Consider sharing a water bottle if you won't need that much water on the route. On the topic of food and water, give some forethought to the other end as well. Try to take care of business before starting up the route (always follow Leave No Trace principles!). On some popular routes, this is such an issue that you can almost route find by sniffing your way to the next belay ledge... Rope Bag No. If you're climbing with a pack, you can just dump the rope in there. Otherwise, learn how to backpack coil a rope. Other Equipment
