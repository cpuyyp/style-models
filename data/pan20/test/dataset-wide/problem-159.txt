Say an individual was born with uncontrollable intermittent ESP. Rather than something fairly innocuous like seeing ghosts, his ESP sees things from beyond. He'll randomly pick up stimulus from a surreal, unpleasant, parallel universe that will interfere with his perception of his own reality. This is perceived like augmented reality rather than whole sensory substitution, with the alien sensations overlaid onto the real ones. He is unable to take care of himself because of the interference in normal perceptions: he might become disoriented by vertigo due to a second gravitational pull or distracted by sudden shrieks and walk into traffic, or fail to attend hygiene when the bathroom fills with foul-smelling slime. Although the symptoms are dramatically different and effectively untreatable (how do you close an imaginary third eye?), would doctors diagnose such a condition as a form of schizophrenia? He probably needs a caretaker and a seeing eye dog if he isn't simply confined in an institution. EDIT: I can provide more detailed explanation of symptoms if that makes it easier to model. The visual symptoms include objects that obscure his line of vision. Learning to navigate blindfolded doesn't help because all of the senses are affected, such as gravity and touch. A loud, continuous noise would render him unable to hear anything else until it stops. Repulsive odors would cause nausea and possibly vomiting. 

Using latin as the source language a la Linnaean taxonomy, what would be a logical terminology for unambiguously distinguishing between these body types? EDIT: The answers I've been getting have been really great. I was inspired to do some more research and discovered some Latin, Greek and "New Latin" vocabulary as an alternative to linguistically correct terms. 

There are several limitations on the size of arthropods, partly related to the square-cube law and partly related to mechanics. All of these limitations have solutions, but the result may not qualify as true arthropods. A general overview may be read in this article. Known records According to this article (quote by wikipedia): 

Computers were originally built and programmed by developers who wrote in the ISO Latin alphabet and as a result all modern computers are biased towards human-readable input in the ISO Latin alphabet. If the originally programmers instead wrote in Devanagari, Hangul, Hanzi, or another writing system which is represented in Unicode through clumsy pre-composed characters, how would they have devised human-readable programming languages and command line inputs biased in favor of their own writing system? 

An interstellar civilization has superluminal travel which allows for travel between two points, effectively without traversing the space in between so they don't crash into anything between them and their target. Navigation presents a problem: the visible stars only give a snapshot of their positions years previous and they have moved since then, so the current position of the target must be calculated. The dangers of incorrect calculations include getting lost or, less commonly, arriving inside a solid object. Getting lost isn't immediately deadly but costs precious time and fuel to detour, assuming you have the instruments necessary to navigate on your own. What logistical concerns are involved in the civilization calculating a constantly updating map of the exact position of every star, planet, moon, and other navigational hazard in the galaxy? (This question is inspired by propulsion in the Battlestar Galactica remake, which uses concepts like "jump drives" and "red lines." I did find an analysis, but wasn't sure whether this applies to FTL in general.) 

We already do (w/ caveats) According to gravity calculations, matter with negative mass exerts a repulsive force on matter with positive mass. Conversely, matter with positive mass exerts an attractive force on matter with negative mass (Source). Matter with negative mass has applications for manipulating space, building flying cars, allowing FTL travel and so forth (Source). This kind of exotic matter has been put forward as a candidate for "dark matter" (Source), which is invisible to all known forms of radiation and detected only by its gravitational effect on other matter. That is, we see it because its gravity bends light around it in lieu of bouncing off it in a manner incongruous with the gravity of the matter we can see. Caveat: dark matter (and "dark energy") is a hypothesis to explain this odd behavior of gravity and has not been confirmed to exist, hence "dark." Alternative explanations such as "dark fluid" don't include it and simply redefine how gravity works at larger scales (Source). 

A hypothetical species is divided into males and females that exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism. The males are further divided into multiple morphs (e.g. α-male, β-male, γ-male, etc). This polymorphism is extreme enough that a viewer unfamiliar with this species could mistake all these morphs for different species. If the species were to possess human-like intelligence, they might treat these morphs as separate genders (e.g. aqir, qntal, guqin, etc). What selection pressures would favor such polymorphism? EDIT: Reproduction is a simple matter of a male inseminating a female. At some point selection pressure caused the males to diverge into multiple morphs. Differences between the morphs are as extreme as those between dog breeds. The details are deliberately vague so that this question could be applied to plants, fish, mammals, etc. EDIT: I do not mean to imply that morphs are necessarily hereditary or limited to a specific number. 

A hypothetical organism is tetraploid and isogametous. To reproduce, four haploid gametes must meet and fuse into a tetraploid zygote. Any four individuals are sexually compatible, barring self-incompatibility or mating types. What selection pressures would favor this method of reproduction over the fusion of a pair of ovum and sperm? EDIT: near as I can tell, this would be a defense against recessive traits, frequent population bottlenecks and frequent mutations. The downside would be a slower overall rate of evolution, I think. 

Zombies are generally biologically impossible. It is not possible to reanimate dead tissue or function without energy input. How could a zombie plague work within the confines of real biology or technology? (Alien-zombies and cyborg-zombies are allowed.) 

A hyperparasite is "a parasite whose host is itself a parasite" and is the closest analogy to an apex predator in the ecology of parasites. Human sociability, intelligence and status as apex predators allowed us to develop civilization. What conditions would pressure a hyperparasite (or hyperparasitoid) to develop social structure, swarm intelligence and eventually civilization? EDIT: This is not about parasitic aliens that invade Earth to take over humans a la The Puppet Masters, Stargate SG-1, Star Trek, Animorphs, and so forth. Those sorts of parasites would themselves be the hosts of the hyperparasites. 

So aliens find Earth to be suitable for colonization and disregard humanity's claim. Not because they are racist, but because they are so different biologically and psychologically that humans simply don't fit their definition of people. Animals, certainly, but not sapient beings deserving of the right to self-determination. Is this plausible? Just how alien would the aliens need to be? 

Most fantasy worlds work according to real physics with magic haphazardly tacked on. I want to build a world where physics works according to magic or, perhaps more accurately, how people in ancient cultures believed physics worked. This magical world resembles a very, very poorly researched pastiche of various historical periods and cultures on Earth. The world is an artificial construct created by deities and is maintained by a vast bureaucracy of spirits and arbitrary whims rather than inviolate laws of physics. Gravity is the result of the flying spaghetti monster holding everything down with his noodly appendages, disease is the result of disease spirits rather than pathogens, weather and natural disasters are the work of spirits, etc. Obsolete scientific theories like spontaneous generation, miasma theory of disease, orgone energy, four humors and so forth are also true. There's no distinction between magic and mundane science, and sufficiently talented or skilled individuals are capable of ignoring these rules (e.g. so skilled at healing you may raise the dead, so skilled at swordplay you can cut mountains in half, etc). However, this runs into problems if you examine things too closely. For example, how does nutrition and nutrient deficiency work? If people are dying of rickets and scurvy despite cellular biology not existing and no way for the primitive cultures to understand why, what is the cause and why are these afflictions cured same way they are in the real world (i.e. sunlight exposure, eating onions)? Are scurvy spirits repelled by onions? Or should I just take the Game of Thrones approach and give everyone better dental, height and overall health than in the real world because it isn't the real world, biology doesn't actually exist, and most of my readers wouldn't actually care about the extreme departures from reality? It does seem awfully inconvenient for major characters to die of simple infections because that would be realistic even though it would drag the narrative to a screeching halt. 

I am operating within the bounds of a fantasy setting which operates under different physics which from our perspective appear like stereotypical magic or alternative medicine. For example, pathogens are evil spirits disrupting the humors and gravity is the earth goddess' love. "Antimagic" is a concept originally invented by D&D in the 70s whereby a wizard could project a field that cancels out everything arbitrarily defined as "magical". Since then it has appeared everywhere in fantasy fiction. How could antimagic be explained in a setting where physics is magic? I can't imagine any analogue in physics other than something destructive like antimatter or black holes. 

In speculative fiction shows like Charmed and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, characters witness firsthand the existence of heaven, perform successful seances and resurrect the dead. Despite this, however, they still act as though death is a horrible tragedy even though characters who have died outright state they are happier being dead than alive. In real life, we only treat death as a tragedy and a mystery because there is no empirical evidence of an afterlife and our minds are incapable of comprehending the sensation of nonexistence. Why do characters act as though death is some tragic mystery even after experiencing all these events that make it very clear that death is a wonderful thing that should be celebrated? EDIT: This has massive implications for our societies. If the afterlife was verified to exist and was qualitatively better than the world of the living, then people would celebrate at funerals rather than mourn. Seances would become as a commonplace as telephone calls and every Halloween families would invite their dead ancestors over for dinner. Religions the world over would redefine themselves to accept this new reality just like most of them accepted modern science aside from a lunatic fringe. 

This question is based on the premise of the X-Men franchise, where superheroes that pass the potential for powers through heredity are used as a metaphor for persecuted minorities. I find this metaphor is self-contradictory because in real life the differences because skin-tone is cosmetic whereas super-villains potentially constitute an existential threat to the human race. While I can understand trying to exterminate/brainwash/cure/rehabilitate super-villains, the vast majority of super powered individuals have human emotions and conscience. While they might cause accidental harm due to inexperience, they could potentially profit from their super powers. Forget military applications, someone with ice powers could open a year-round ski resort in the Bahamas! Even seemingly useless superpowers could be exploited with enough creativity. To say nothing of how useful are mundane powers that make you equal to Einstein or an Olympic athlete. Are muggles more likely to try exterminating all super people or more likely to exploit them? 

So this hypothetical setting is the standard pastiche of European history with dragons and orcs and elves. The author wants to include people of color as a normal, widespread and accepted part of this heavily multicultural setting just as much as dwarves and halflings and talking skeletons. How could their presence be explained in such a way that the audience may continue to suspend disbelief? (Young Earth Creationism is true in-setting: all human races in-setting were created in their present forms by the in-setting gods 6000 years previous to the frame of reference and cannot evolve. The setting is not composed of matter and doesn't obey physics, so melanin, vitamin D, photons, DNA, etc don't exist.) EDIT: Skin tone thus has no correlation to latitude in-setting. No humans in-setting have skin tones that don't exist in the real world. 

Conclusion Giant arthropods cannot exist without high amounts of atmospheric oxygen. Even then their exoskeletons cannot compete with endoskeletons. Overcoming these limitations would require the evolution of a new clade of pseudo-arthropods with a variety of unique strategies. 

the animal-like gynophyte is fertilized by contact with the pollen of the plant-like androphyte the gynophyte gestates animal-like carposporophytes which consume their mother many carpophytes are produced by a single gynophyte and their motility allows them cover more distance the carposporophytes asexually gestate plant-like tetrasporophytes which eventually consume their parent and root in nearby soil the tetraphytes will asexually clone themselves to cover more ground the megatetraphyte asexually spawns motile gynophytes which may travel further away the microtetraphyte grows multiple androphytes which are completely dependent on their parent a la angiosperms 

It wouldn't without redefining murder Religions of evil never existed in reality: they were imagined to justify the persecution of foreigners. A god of murder only makes sense if the "murder" is morally or socially justified (not necessarily at the same time). For example: vigilante justice, mercy killing and warfare. Vigilantism Murdering tyrants and criminals that escape justice is technically murder even if motivated by a good cause. To be fair, it doesn't actually make you morally superior to the ones you kill unless you receive the community's approval. The entire point of capital punishment is that it is socially approved murder. Mercy killing Mercy killing, assisted suicide and so forth is morally tricky. Unless you have oracular powers that allow you to determine whether killing someone now will spare them a lifetime of suffering, it is morally reprehensible to take the lives of innocents. Furthermore, this opens the door for situations where killing an innocent person destined for a long and happy life will result in less suffering for more people overall due to the vagaries of fate. In which case the moral option is to murder the god of fate and replace them with a less sadistic and arbitrary god. Warfare Warfare is socially approved mass murder. Regardless of how it is justified, killing is still killing.
