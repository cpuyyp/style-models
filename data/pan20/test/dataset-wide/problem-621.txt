Bending the dropout more sounds like a bad idea. It should be parallel to the other dropout, and have the correct OLD spacing for your hub. I've had to file off the backside of the derailleur hanger on a couple different bikes, but that bolt is anti-rotation and isn't doing much to hold the derailleur on. So it can be thinned down successfully. Its not hardened steel so a normal file should do the job fine. Your other option is to adjust any spacers you have on your wheel to re-center it, and possibly adjust every spoke nipple to move the rim over a bit and keep it centered. 7 speed casssettes are totally available from a decent LBS, or you can order them from wiggle or CRC online. There's not a huge amount of choice, but 12-28 is not uncommon. 

Sounds like your chain is not suitable for the master link, or the master link is not closing right. There's no need to use a master link if you prefer to use the more traditional pins. If you only ever take a chain off to change it, the advantages of a master link are not relevant. Its possible to use sliding lockjaw pliers to push a pin in, but you run the risk of twisting it and making a poor seat. Buy a chain tool if you're serious about riding a bike, or ask around other riders who may have one already. If you can provide more info on your master link (like a clear photo) then it may be obvious to the rest of us what is happening. 

I have a trailer like the others pictured here. However it also has a removable handlebar across the back and a third wheel at the front, and the drawbar can fold underneath, turning it into an odd-looking three-wheel pushchair/pram. Don't need to lock it outside the supermarket if you're pushing it around inside the supermarket. Only downside is its a fraction wider than a normal shopping trolley/cart so other people tend to clip it. 

A group riding together and cooperating will ride to a set speed, so you'll be surging if you exceed that speed for long. A simple wheel-magnet speedo and bike computer helps show this on your bars without being big or expensive. An ad-hoc group will ride with varying speeds depending on who's in the front and whether they are trying to make a break away or if they're just sick of waiting for the rest of the group to cycle through the paceline. Some riders need short pulls and some can cope with long pulls at the front. Separately some people need short rests out of the wind, and some people require quite long periods behind someone else to regain their pace. The best groups work together for the end goal which is a good training ride. In racing, your team is your group and the other teams are NOT your friends so they're working for themselves. A race peloton is therefore an adhoc group of teams who are not working together. 

Yes, it will come off okay. There is no need to remove the chain or FD to access any format of BB. You can either drop the chain off the Right side of the big chainring with your hands and let it hang from the FD to the lower wheel, or you can shift to the smallest chainring/granny and then lift the chain so it rests around the BB housing. The FD has to clear the large chainring in its normal positions regardless of gear choice, so won't collide. Either way will work fine, but you will get dirty. Just try it, you're overthinking possible problems. 

Google is your friend. Based on a report from the South Yorkshire Police , they received a report of a stolen BMX with "mbi-2325" as the "serial number" in 2010. Seems to be a mistake in that was a frame model and the serial number is one of the other values. However this same police report lists it as 

By comparison a top folder like a brompton has a 5 year warranty on the frame, and only on material and manufacturing faults. This will not cover accident damage or wear and tear. 

I've managed to strip the threads on my front deraileruer mechanism. Its off the bike now - can I ride it as-is until I locate a new front mechanism? The chain does stay on the front chainring where it is placed manually, while stopped. (I'd not do this while pedalling, I like counting all the way to 10 on my fingers!) If the chain falls off the outside it will get caught on the pedal or right crankarm, and if it falls off the left its on the chain. ...now to find a three-position front derailer with top swing and bottom pull and a braze-on mount. 

I don't care what colour people ride. At least they're riding! Black seems to appeal to thieves a bit more, so I'd not choose a dark bike by preference. Also, dark bikes don't help you stand out in the dark. As a safety choice I'd always choose a lighter-coloured frame. Same goes for clothing - this recent trend of dark cycling kit seems a step backwards. Reflectorised stuff helps, but it still depends on a light shining toward you at the same time someone's eyes are looking at you. Personally I have 1 blue and 2 red frame for everyday bikes, and one more blue frame in the rebuild queue. 

In a word - tolerances. The fastener tends to be oversize and the tool tends to be under the nominal size. $URL$ is a good run down, but the upshot is that the larger the difference between the fitting and the tool, the more force is focused on a smaller area, being the corners. A nominal 5mm hex hole should use a 5mm tool, but if it was exactly the same internal and external size, then your tool would be hard to fit and harder to remove. This assumes your tool is the correct size for the job. Using a 3/16" tool in a 5mm fastener is a recipe for disaster. If you don't own the right tool, buy the right tool, whether it be a workshop P handle driver or a quality multitool for on-bike. 

Your specs link shows a 11-36T cassette with a double chainring with 39T and 26T. So your "fast" gear is 39:11. Assumning 29" wheels with 2.3" tyres, 1 revolution of the crank carries you 

When pedalling normally, it feels "okay" but when exerting some force on a climb I can feel the pedals bend under the load. It gets much worse when out of the saddle. If I were to estimate, it might be a 10 degree deflection of the pedal body from the pedal axle center line. To minimise the effect, I've made a conscious effort to put the ball of the foot on the silver metal part, which feels much more solid than the rest of the pedal. So my main question: Is this normal for folding pedals or should I be exploring for folding pedals that are more solid? Or do I simply fit normal pedals? This may interfere with the folding function on the left crank, and will leave the right one poking out more as a shin-collector. On the plus side, clipless. 

Also consider some help from an ebike motor. It may not be fully to your preference, but the small push on the steepest bits will help save your knees and your heart. This may go against the "purity" ethos that some cyclists value, but at the end of the day its all about riding. There are retrofit wheel kits for existing bikes, or a bolt-on mid drive, or a much more subtle bottom bracket booster like that woman used in the CX competition (apparently by mistake) A higher end solution would be to get an electric road bike where the motor is integrated into the frame at the bottom bracket, and batteries are stored in the downtube rather than bolted onto your water bottle mounts or out the back on a parcel rack. But that's much more cost. 

I'd suggest you try tightening the Non Drive Side cup and see if there are any improvements. You don't even need to remove the crank for this. The right tool will just slip on, or you can get away with a big spanner and some plumber's sliding jaw grips. If this helps the problem even a little, a proper clean and regrease will help a lot more. 

YES smoother tyres are better than knobblies for road usage. Knobblies means your tyre's carcass is a little higher off the road, and if your knobs land on the corners of the bumps, then there's a lot more rubber between the compressed air and the edge. Downside is knobbly tyres (tires) tend to be less thick between the bumps. So if you hit the obstacle between tyre knobs, then there's less thickness. Generally you want smoother tyres for on-road. Commuter or touring type tyres tend to have more thickness, at the cost of more weight. Racing tyres tend to be made thinner, for weight. Also your cornering on smoother tyres feels better, because knobs tend to squirm sideways under load. But the biggest thing is your technique. 

Another solution might be to cut a ring of aluminium, and pop-rivet it around the hole. Roughen the plastic, and use some epoxy between them, then apply pop rivets so the flattest side is against the lock. You might want to use a peening hammer to flatten and round-off the side where your fingers are. Also watch out for making it too thick. Contact the supplier and see if a replacement is available - looks like a good holder, just lacking in the design department. Maybe a later model has more meat in that area. 

Depends on your budget. I'd try serving the freehub properly by opening it and cleaning it, or quick and nasty by flooding it with petrol for a day then dry it, and then squirt lube in. Either way if it doesn't work, you're up for a new freehub. Your chain is new which is great, probably a good time to inspect the cassette for wear too. Do update the question and tell us what you ended up doing.... this helps future searchers. 

If you face some decent climbs in your route, then groups tend to fall apart as everyone climbs at their own pace. For training and bunch rides, stop at the top and let everyone get there, then rest till the last arrival is ready to carry on. Otherwise the first arrivals are rested while the last people are shattered and the group breaks up or is held back. Same goes for downhill - strava segments work on segment time, not first-down time :) 

This answer is based on wanting faster gearing, higher ratios. To go faster you need to have smaller/lower tooth count cogs on the rear cassette, or a larger chainring. Or both. There is a physical limit of about 13 teeth for a freewheel and 11 teeth for a cassette. There are BMX bikes and folding bikes that can go as low as 9 and rarely 8 teeth, but they require special wheel hubs. SO if you're already on an 11 tooth small cof on your cassette, the only option is to upsize the front chainring. Your main problem is clearance for a larger chainring. Firstly it has to clear the right-side chainstay. If that doesn't fit then you're out of luck. Start with a cardboard template to see how much lager a chainring you could fit. Then check clearance in all other directions - your breakover clearance (how close you are to the ground) will decrease. Your front wheel will probably clear things, because it has to clear the pedal when in the forward position. Upwards should be fine, but depending on your frame check all possible. If your existing chainring is rivetted onto the crank spider then you're stuck, and will have to buy a new crankset. Otherwise you'll need to find the BCD of your existing chainring. Take it off and print this PDF at 100% then compare. You will get an answer like 64, 88, 94, 96, 102, 104, 120. If it doesn't match, check your printout was 100% scale. Then buy the biggest chainring that will fit, that has the same BCD as your existing crank-spider. Finally you'll need to add more links to your chain, so just buy one or two new ones. 

I opened an alfine shifter wrongly to change the inner cable recently. The indicator mechanism is an incredibly lightweight and flimsy series of plastic levers and a cam. The details will probably vary, but to fix it I had to take off the top cover (2 screws) and then used a length of sewing cotton looped around a lever to hold it back, while I reassembled the top cover... the fingers were too fat to do it. 

From your one photo, we can tell is its a road bike, probably painted black. I think its been converted to single speed because there's a clearly visible downtube boss, with no lever in it. So its fair to assume there's no decals or labels either TL;DR you're completely out of luck. Be mad at whoever painted it and removed the head tube and covered all markings. You might be lucky and peel the paint off showing some kind of lettering, but that's unlikely to work. 

Bike chains come in two sizes. There's 1/8" chain for single speeds (bikes without a derailler) and 3/16" which is for geared bikes with a rear derailleur. In addition you can get master links for 6/7/8 speed, or 9 speed or 10 speed or 11 speed. So count the number of cogs in your rear cassette and go from there. Master kinks are cheap. Buy a couple, put a spare on each bike you ride.
