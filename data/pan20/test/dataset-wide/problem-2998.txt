I am new to the Philosophy Stack Exchange, though I have been a member of the History Stack Exchange for 3 months. I recently posted 2 answers on the Christianity Stack Exchange regarding the questionable relationship between Deism and Christianity. Admittedly, I know very little about Huxley's Agnosticism-(I believe it is Thomas Huxley who was the Agnostic. Aldous wrote the famous Distopia "Brave New World"). However, I write this post as someone who is familiar with Agnosticism. For an Agnostic, the topic of God is inherently unknowable and truly mysterious. The Agnostic's position is predicated on the notion that such a Grand Entity cannot be proved nor disproved. The nature of proof is exclusively geared towards the physical, the materialistic and the tangible; even the intangibility of something, such as Gravity or Time, is still within the realm of the physical and the materialistic. How exactly one can try to prove or for that matter disprove God's existence, are questions that have been asked for time immemorial into the present-day; and yet, we always return "back to square one".......... unresolved and unanswered. If, however, one chooses to believe in God(s), then he or she certainly has the ability to do so; a belief does not always necessitate proof or affirmation. You can believe that you are going to win the million dollar lottery, though you do not know that you are going to win the lottery-(unless you choose to validate the role of Prophecy and Presaging). The difficulty that Agnosticism has with so-called Prophets and Clairvoyants, are their spectacular forecasts which in most cases have and continue to yield disappointing results. However, for Theists and "People of Faith", Prophecy provides an opening into the future and in turn, recognizes the magical and miraculous power that a small number of individuals have been and are still able to wield. If one was to compare an Agnostic with a Theist, both would initially agree with the plausible premise that the existence of God cannot be known and is truly a mystery. However, The Agnostic typically stops at the word, "mystery", whereas the Theist typically continues onward and goes a step further by saying, "Yes it is a mystery, though I still believe in God's existence anyway"-(and a few Theists go a step further by undertaking the erroneous tasking of trying to prove God's existence). If an Agnostic were to continue onward, like the Theist, with regard to believing in-(or even claiming to know about) God's existence, then an Agnostic....... ceases to be an Agnostic and may as well call himself or herself, a Theist. Now an Agnostic could hope that there is a benign or graceful God; it is certainly not wrong-(either intellectually or morally) to express one's hope for a Gracious Grand Being, as well as a Heavenly Hereafter. Again, I return to my lottery analogy; one can hope that he or she wins the million dollar lottery, but to say I believe or that I know I am going to win the lottery, is just plain foolish. And although the lottery is certainly not God, the rather plain spoken and seemingly simplistic comparison may have some profundity which underscores an Epistemological problem that has mystified humankind since our earliest known origins......and I suspect, will continue to mystify us. Agnosticism may not be the perfect answer........though it does offer a level of intellectual honesty that few seem to welcome. 

The modern concept of "particle" is that it has no properties except when "measured". The quantum fields that are used to calculate observational/experimental results cannot be thought of as "existing entities" in anything like a classical sense. (They vanish everywhere but at points of interactions so it makes no sense to think of them as something existing in space time just before the interaction which then vanishes when the "particle" or property is localized or somehow detected. We aren't really detecting "particles" but that is the terminology used out of habit. The concept of "matter" also is obsolete since any self respecting matter would never act like a quantum field. The word "substance" is , I suppose less restrictive, but one would have to have some observational account of it to see how it might fit into our theories. 

I would think that Whitehead would be what you want. From Wikipedia... Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.[18] Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy. The notion of "process" is just another word for change. In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" are problematic. These "classical" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions, but are not the world's basic building blocks.[86] What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events.[87] After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience. These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a "society" of events.[88] By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness").[76][89] 

the objective counterparts would form a world having the same structure as the phenomenal world This is just saying that if you make a true statement "about the world" it is necessarily given more or less directly in terms of our perceptions.Since the statement is true there must be something "out there" (responsible for our perceptions) that has the kind of structure given in the statement. So we have the structure indicated by our statement and some external arrangement of 'stuff' acting in the manner described by the statement. In short, every proposition having a communicable significance must be true of both worlds or of neither. So whatever we say in a statement must apply to the world of experience and the objective world and if true in the world of experience is also true for whatever 'stuff' it is describing. 

I think that your question may be related to the more general "being assured that you'll live in full happiness, why would you refuse to enter into a system where you abandon critical mind which is bind to worrisome, and so decrease your happiness potential?". Formulated this way, I think it become even more clear that anyone pretending that he can guaranty you a completely safe sandbox is either : 

Structuralism is a theory that emphasis on functional relations between elements of a system, with abstractions that drop the content of the system and its evolution. The structuralism school counts, amongst others : 

The question may gain distinguishing what kind of validity you are seeking for. On the one hand, you may be "simply" interested in using the state of the art mathematical tools to ensure that your engineering project as a consistent specification and that the thing that you built map exactly that. If that's what you are interested for, proof assistant may be an interesting entry point. On the other hand you may be interested with more ontological concerns, like knowing if mathematical objects reveals eternal underlying truths or if their are just mere mental representations resulting from an ugly patchwork of cognitive biases. If that's what you are looking for, you may look up for realism, idealism, solipsism as entry points. 

To answer such a question, you have to define a criteria on which you order and a way to finitely determine a rank in this order for each being you want to order. You can of course chose criteria that fit your initial expected result, for example here "I know I am going to die (don't) make me inferior/superior to all the other living creatures". What you may ask then is "is there some non-subjective/objective ordering I could use?". To my mind, the best you may expect is an univocal consensus, which in actual problems may seems next to impossible. 

You will probably want to document on constructionism. (Please try to put a question in your title and to use the description to specify your request.) 

Yes, law of identity is an axiom, something that is asked to be considered true without proof. Generally, the only argument provided to support such a statement is its "self-evidence". But not all philosophies agree that identities exists. Probably the most famous saying expressing an other point of view is "No man ever steps in the same river twice", attributed to Heraclitus. 

Don't you think you also tend to build continue representation of obviously discrete objects? Think how films are working: 27 pictures per seconds and there you think it's a continuous movement. Your mind even don't bother to inform your conciseness it's an illusion. Both discrete and continue approach are used in our everyday representations of the world, as well as in abstract theories. 

There is no way to detect a particle in two locations at once, that's the whole idea. Saying that it is in two places at once is not an empirically meaningful statement. Neither is saying that the cat is alive and dead at the same time. Quantum mechanics definitely does not claim that the cat is alive and dead at the same time or that particles are in two places at once. A better statement would be that the particle doesn't actually have any location until detection. Also that the cat has no properties at all until such properties are empirically determined. That was the problem with the EPR proposal, assuming "elements of reality" in-between interactions/measurements. The conceptual construct of "dead" or "alive" is a 100% non probabilistic state (at least as conceived by an individual within his frame of reference). This 100% certainty can be seen as an 'objective reality' for the individual with that information.. This is not well put. Saying that a probabilistic statement is non-probabilistic because we are certain of the probabilities is really just a word game. Being certain that we don't know something is at best "subjective reality". 

It all depends on what you mean by 'meaningless'. Start with what you mean by 'meaning'. We say words have meanings because of their associations in conventional usage. I doubt that you mean this kind of meaning. Other things have meaning to those who know about causal relationships between the stimulus (the thing said to have meaning, say a certain pattern of a footprint)and some other points of interest (It's from a deer, made only in the last hour, and the deer went 'that a way'). The same pattern might have no such meaning to a city dweller who has no experience in such a thing. Both instances of meaning are related whereby some information/experience is said to have meaning because it can tell us more than just a random pattern. I rather doubt that this is the notion of meaning that you are concerned with as well. I think that you mean 'emotional meaning'. This refers to aspects of situations that you personally care about. It is not entirely unrelated to the earlier examples but seems much closer to your concern. People will say that their lives are meaningless when they are emotionally disconnected from their activities. They are doing things that they don't care much about. Emotional meaning is all about YOU. Figure out what you want to do/ what you think that you should do, at least try to start sorting it out. Given some time, if you think it through, try different things you'll find your own direction, a direction (or directions) that you sincerely care about pursuing. Then as you make progress and suffer failures your life will be full of meaning. I didn't intend the above as a self help talk although if it sounds like one that's incidental but fine by me."Life" is a word, if you want it to have more meaning than that you are just alienated from your own activities and confusing meaning of a word with personal purpose. I make this as a philosophical point. I believe it's called a category mistake. 

You don't only act based on what you think about people, but also on what you think would happen if you acted in one manner or an other. You may think that no one is perfect, that to err is human, but that with encouragements, people have better chances to achieve goals. So I would say you can sincerely trust someone and still have some doubts on the result of their actions. From doubt to anxiety, there is only a little step, whether you consider that a mistrust step is up to you. You can even even wonder, aren't you mistrusting yourself? That is, your ability to live placidly whatever uncertain events may happen? 

Now, even in the last case, the problem is that even if it's true, as a human being you can't access absolute certitude that the entity which promise you the safe sandbox is really what he pretend to be. Believe it would be an act of faith completely drived by your hope it's true, ignoring your awareness that it may be false. And this awareness is provided precisely by your critical mind, the safeguard that you should abandon to check whether it was true or not. And once you abandon this safeguard, there's no guaranty you can have it back. So I would say that this category of problem rely on the false assumption that you may be in a situation of perfect certitude that you'll live the promised situation. To me it sounds exactly like "if you accord to someone that everything he may say is true, then for you everything he will say will be true". The reasoning may be valid, but to my mind premises are seriously doubtful. 

Assuming you have ten fingers and that you begin to count at zero, using only fingers as an atomic information storage, you may count up to 210-1=1023. Now you may use your fingers as "non-atomic" information storage. For example there's a technique which use the three visible division of each finger and use the thumb to mark one of the other digit of the same hand. This way you can easily count to 12 on one hand. There are also other techniques which enable to count bigger number on one hand. Moreover in your example, the user must remember in his mind how many times he used each hand. So it's not a pure finger coding technique but a mix with mind memory. 

First let's recall that, whatever what is time, we are all time traveler, but humans, as far as I know, only travel in one way. Now if you give yourself the hypothesis of backward time travel, that is going into a context where your perceptions would give you the expected inputs of a world matching your representation of a past world, then there would be two theory I'm aware of. The first one stands that this world and the future from which you came from are binded, so you would not be able to make anything that would change the future in a way preventing you from going back. In other words, the world as integrated consistency rules that would prevent anything like you killing your ancestor before you was born. The second one stands that this world and the future from which you came from are evolving independently and what you will change here won't change the world you came from. In other words you can think this more like a travel into a parallel world that happen to be the same as the one you came from with a time-shift : how would you make the difference? Even if you would "return to the future", how would you make the difference between actually going to the changed future and going to a parallel world where things seems like your point of depart with differences expected from your actions "in the past"? Those said, assuming you have no bidirectionnal time machine nor parallel world exploration device, you will probably make a better use of your ability to plan by trying to avoid future disasters. Of course you don't know the future, but the point of studying past disasters is to avoid their repetition in your lifetime: a very hard challenge, but probably still far easier than trying to avoid all past tragedies of mankind.
