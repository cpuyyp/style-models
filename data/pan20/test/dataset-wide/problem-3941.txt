That 1 implies 2 is trivial. Suppose conversely that 1 fails. Then there exists a nontrivial group $G$ satisfying the law $w$. Being nontrivial, $G$ has a nontrivial cyclic subgroup, and the latter has a quotient of prime order. Since satisfying a law passes to subgroups and quotients, we deduce that this group of prime order satisfies the law $w$, showing the failure of 2. If 3 fails, then $w\in [F,F]F^p$ for some prime $p$ and hence $w$ holds in the cyclic group of order $p$, showing failure of 2. Conversely, assume 3. A primitive element of a free abelian group can be mapped by an automorphism to the first basis vector, and hence by an homomorphism to the generator of the infinite cyclic subgroup, and hence after composition to any element of any group. Let now $G$ be any nontrivial group; then we have an homomorphism $F\to G$ mapping $w$ to a nontrivial element, so $G$ fails to satisfy $w$. Thus $w$ characterizes the trivial group among all groups. 

Here's a recipe to produce f.p. groups with solvable word problem at least as hard as the membership problem in any set $A$ of positive integers. Consider the group $$\Gamma_A=\langle t,x\mid [t^nxt^{-n},x]=1, \forall n\in A\rangle.$$ Then for $n>0$, $[t^nxt^{-n},x]=1$ in $\Gamma_A$ iff $n\in A$. In particular, ($\#$) any algorithm for the word problem in $\Gamma_A$ with complexity $f(n)$ (supremum of halting time for inputs in the $n$-ball) solves the membership problem in $A$ with halting time $\le f(4n+4)$. The group $\Gamma_A$ has solvable word problem iff $A$ is recursive. So for finitely generated group we are already done with no prerequisites (of course this boils down to the question of complexity of the membership problem in recursive subsets integers, but this is no longer group theory). Now an adaptation of Higman's embedding theorem by Clapham (C. R. J. Clapham. An embedding theorem for finitely generated groups‚Äù, Proc. London. Math. Soc. (3), 17, 1967, 419-430.) yields that every f.g. group with solvable word problem embeds into a finitely presented group with solvable word problem. If we embed $\Gamma_A$ into such a finitely presented group $\Lambda$ and require that $t,x$ are among a generating subset, then ($\#$) above also holds in $\Lambda$. The case of residually finite finitely presented groups is considerably harder and is addressed by the Kharlampovich-Myasnikov-Sapir paper referenced in Andreas Thom's answer. 

There's no topologically mixing self-homeomorphism of the circle. Indeed, pick 3 points, so that the complement of these 3 points consists of 3 intervals $A,B,C$. If $g$ is a self-homeomorphism such that $g(A)$ meets all of $A,B,C$, then it has to contain entirely one of $A,B,C$. Therefore it is not possible that all the intersections $g(A)\cap A$, $g(A)\cap B$, $g(A)\cap C$, $g(B)\cap A$, $g(B)\cap B$, $g(B)\cap C$ be simultaneously nonempty. (If $f$ were a topologically mixing self-homeomorphism, $f^n$ for large $n$ would have to satisfy this property.) On $S^2$ it's completely another question. 

No. Consider the group $H$ of $2\times 2$ matrices of the form $d_t=\begin{pmatrix}t & 0 \\ 0 & t^{-1}\end{pmatrix}$ or $c_t=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & u^{-1} \\ u & 0\end{pmatrix}$ with $t\in k^*$. Let $G$ be the group of $4\times 4$ matrices of the form either $D_{t,u}=\begin{pmatrix}d_t & 0 \\ 0 & d_u\end{pmatrix}$ or $C_{t,u}=\begin{pmatrix}c_t & 0 \\ 0 & c_u\end{pmatrix}$, $t,u\in k^*$. Its identity component contains a matrix with no double eigenvalue (any $D_{t,u}$ with $t,u,t^{-1},u^{-1}$ pairwise distinct. On the other hand, the other component consists of the $C_{t,u}$, which have the spectrum $(1,-1,1,-1)$. 

The map $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\mapsto\langle\cdot,[\cdot,\cdot]\rangle$ is usually called Koszul homomorphism. Indeed Koszul showed that for a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero it is an isomorphism. For an arbitrary Lie algebra (say over a field of characteristic zero), it always maps into the space of closed 3-forms $Z^3(\mathfrak{g})$, and thus defines by composition a natural homomorphism from the space $\mathrm{Sym}^2(\mathfrak{g})^\mathfrak{g}$ of invariant symmetric bilinear forms to the 3-cohomology space $H^3(\mathfrak{g})$ (let's call it "reduced Koszul homomorphism"), and there is an exact sequence in which the reduced Koszul homomorphism fits, see Neeb-Wagemann's appendix. In particular, if $H^1(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}^*)=H^2(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}^*)=0$ then the reduced Koszul homomorphism is an isomorphism (I don't have in mind any example for which this holds other than the semisimple ones). It is not an isomorphism in general (neither injective nor surjective), for instance for an abelian Lie algebra it is the zero map; Magnin actually checked (see here) that the Koszul homomorphism is zero for every nilpotent Lie algebra up to dimension 7. Magnin also checks that the Koszul homomorphism itself is zero in many cases (this means that the invariant symmetric bilinear forms are only the obvious ones: those symmetric bilinear forms whose kernel contains $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$). This concerns specifically this natural map; in general I don't think there is much to say: to say that the vector spaces $\mathrm{Sym}^2(\mathfrak{g})^\mathfrak{g}$ and $H^3(\mathfrak{g})$ are isomorphic just means that they have the same dimension. 

$G$ is locally free (i.e., all its finitely generated subgroups are free) $G$ is a filtering inductive limit of free groups with injective connecting homomorphisms $G$ is a filtering inductive limit of free groups. 

Idea of the proof. Categorically usually describes $G\times H$ by showing that it represents $K\mapsto\mathrm{Hom}(K,G)\times \mathrm{Hom}(K,H)$. But one needs here to describe it on the left, i.e. to describe $\mathrm{Hom}(G\times H,K)$, which can be described as the set of pairs $(u,v)$ in $\mathrm{Hom}(H,K)\times\mathrm{Hom}(G,K)$ whose images centralize each other. Next, one observe that for $U\in D$, both $\mathrm{Hom}(L(G\times H),U)$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,U)$ can be described as the set of pairs in $\mathrm{Hom}(H,K)\times\mathrm{Hom}(G,K)$ whose images centralize each other; more precisely, we have a canonical homomorphism $\pi:L(G\times H)\to LG\times LH$ inducing a bijection $\mathrm{Hom}(LG\times LH,U)$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(L(G\times H),U)$ for all $U\in D$ (given by $f\mapsto f\circ \pi$). One would like to conclude from Yoneda's lemma; however we cannot because $LG\times LH$ might not be in $D$. Nevertheless, we can argue as in the proof of Yoneda's lemma, picking $U=L(G\times H)$ and consider a preimage of the identity map of $L(G\times H)$. This yields $f$ such that $f\circ\pi$ is the identity of $L(G\times H)$ and thus $\pi$ is injective. So to conclude we need to show that $\pi$ is surjective and this is actually the beginning of the proof below, since it uses very little. 

Here's an example where they are not isomorphic, with $n=1$. Let $k$ be the order of the image of $\varphi$, which is also the image of $\sigma\phi$ (since $\mathbf{C}^*$ has a single subgroup of each given order). Then $\varphi$ can be viewed, after some fixed identification, as the fibre product $H\times_{(\mathbf{Z}/k\mathbf{Z})^n,\varphi}\mathbf{Z}^n$. An element $\sigma$ is just the choice of some element in $\ell\in (\mathbf{Z}/k\mathbf{Z})^*$, and this changes $\varphi$ to $\varphi^\ell:h\mapsto\varphi(h)^\ell$, . Now consider the semidirect product $H=(\mathbf{Z}/5\mathbf{Z})\ltimes_4 (\mathbf{Z}/11\mathbf{Z})$, here the notation means that the generator of order 5 acts by multiplication by 4 on the right (which is indeed of order 5 modulo 11), and $\varphi$ the canonical projection to $\mathbf{Z}/5\mathbf{Z}$, and $\sigma_c$ the automorphism of $\mathbf{Z}/5\mathbf{Z}$ given by multiplication by $c\in(\mathbf{Z}/5\mathbf{Z})^*$. Then $E(\sigma_c\varphi)=\mathbf{Z}\ltimes_{4^{c^{-1}}}(\mathbf{Z}/11\mathbf{Z})$, where the generator of $\mathbf{Z}$ acts by multiplication by $4^{c^{-1}}$ (beware that $c^{-1}$ is modulo 5 but $4^{c^{-1}}$ is modulo 11). Then $E(\sigma_1\varphi)=E(\varphi)$ and $E(\sigma_2\varphi)$ are not isomorphic ($4^{2^{-1}}$ is then equal to $-2$). The argument if that these groups both have a unique normal subgroup of order 11, and a unique homomorphism $f$ onto $\mathbf{Z}$ up to sign, and that elements of $f^{-1}(\{-1,1\})$ act on the normal subgroup by multiplication by $\pm 4$ in $E(\varphi)$, by multiplication by $\pm 2$ in $E(\sigma_2\varphi)$, and the automorphisms of $\mathbf{Z}/11\mathbf{Z}$ of multiplication by $\pm 2$ and by $\pm 4$ are not conjugate. In your original language, $\varphi$ is the homomorphism to $\mathbf{C}^*$ mapping the generator of order 5 to $\omega_5=\exp(2i\pi/5)$ and mapping the generator of order 11 to 1, and $\sigma$ is any field automorphism of $\mathbf{C}$ mapping $\omega_5$ to $\omega_5^2$. 

Now assume that $q\neq p$. If $A$ is uncountable and splits as a direct sum of two submodules, one of the two is uncountable and we are done. Assume otherwise ($A$ is "indecomposable"). Again denote by $x_n$ the generators of $C_{q^\infty}$ with $x_0=1$ and $x_{n+1}^q=x_n$. Then $x_n$ is an operator on $A$ vanished by some polynomial (namely $X^{q^n}-1$) with simple roots, hence for each $n$, we have a decomposition $A=\bigoplus_{P\in\mathcal{P}_n}A_P$, where $\mathcal{P}_n$ is the set of monic irreducible divisors of $X^{q^n}-1$ and $A_P=\mathrm{Ker}(P(x_n))$. Since $A$ is indecomposable, there exists a unique $P\in\mathcal{P}_n$ such that $A_P\neq 0$; denote it by $P_n$. So $P_n$ is irreducible and $P_n(x_n)=0$. Thus the subring $R_n$ of $\mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{F}_p}(A)$ generated by $x_n$ is a (finite) field. We have $R_n\subset R_{n+1}$ for all $n$ and hence $K=\bigcup R_n$ is a field as well; it is at most countable. On the other hand, the image of $C_{q^\infty}$ in $\mathrm{End}_{\mathbf{F}_p}(A)$ is contained in $K$. Hence any decomposition of $A$ as a $K$-module is $C_{q^\infty}$-invariant. In particular, we deduce that if $A$ is uncountable, then it is decomposable (as a direct sum of uncountably many countable submodules), contradiction. 

No. Call the minimal cardinal of a subset $S$ such that $H\cup S$ generates $G$, the (generating) corank of $H$ in $G$. I claim that 

Here's a simple example. Fix a domain $k$. Consider the (associative unital) ring $R=k\langle x,y\rangle/\langle\!xy=0\rangle\!\rangle$. Let $t$ be its endomorphism $x\mapsto 0$, $y\mapsto y$. 0) A basis of $R$ is given by the $y^nx^m$, $n,m\ge 0$. 1) I claim that $R$ right central reflexive, and even satisfies $aRb=0$ implies $bRt(a)=0$. Indeed, suppose $aRb=0$ with $a,b$ nonzero. Write $a=P(y)+Q(y)x$ and $b=\sum_{i\ge 0}R_i(y)x^i$. Since $ayb=0$, we have $0=(P+Qx)y(\sum_{i\ge 0}R_ix^i)=\sum_iP(y)yR_i(y)$. Projecting (with respect to the basis) to $k[y]x^i$, we deduce that $P(y)yR_i(y)=0$ for all $i$. Since $b\neq 0$, there exists $i$ such that $R_i\neq 0$ and we deduce $P(y)=0$, so $a=Q(y)x$. Thus $t(a)=0$, so $bRt(a)=0$. 2) $(*)$ fails with $(a,b)=(1,x)$: indeed $1Rt(x)=0$, but $xR1=xR$ contains $x$ and is not central as $0=xy\neq yx$. 

(05/05/2015) If $T$ is a permutation of any set $X$ with a (finite) odd number of 2-cycles, then $T$ is not a square in the group of permutations of $X$ (because if $T=U^2$ then $T$ commutes with $U$ --this assumption in the question is thus redundant--, hence $U$ preserves the union $J$ of 2-cycles of $T$ and acts on $J$ so that $U^2$ has no fixed point, hence only with 4-cycles, so if $J$ is finite then its cardinal is a multiple of 4). This applies to the 2-sided shift in 2 letters, which has a single orbit of cardinal 2 (this follows the argument in the comment). Hence $T$ is not even a square in the full group of permutations of the Cantor set $\{0,1\}^\mathbf{Z}$. More generally one can wonder whether we can write $T=U^p$ for any given prime $p$; then the argument works if the union of $p$-cycles has cardinal not divisible by $p$ or equivalently if we do not have $2^{p-1}\neq 1\mod p^2$. This seems to hold for most primes... a computer search shows that the first two primes $p$ such that $2^{p-1}\equiv 1\mod p^2$ are... 1093 and 3511. I looked up Sloane's Encyclopedia about this sequence, who knows it: Wieferich primes; Sloane's sequence A001220, see also Wikipedia; these are the only two known such primes, and there is no other smaller than $10^{17}$¬†! Thus shows that $T$ is not a cube, etc, but for these Wieferich primes I do not know what's going on. Edit (12/06/2015): it is easy to check that if conversely $p$ is a Wieferich prime, then $T$ is a $p$-power in the full group of permutations of $\{0,1\}^\mathbf{Z}$. Indeed it amounts to checking that for every multiple $n$ of $p$ (including $\infty$), the number of $n$-cycles is divisible by $p$ (allowing $\infty$). This is trivial for $\infty$ (infinitely many $\infty$-cycles). Otherwise this is done by induction on $n/p$. Write $n=p^km$ with $m$ coprime to $p$. The number of $n$-periodic elements is $2^n$; those $m$-periodic is $s=2^m$. So the number of $n$-periodic elements whose period is divisible by $p$ is $2^n-2^m=2^m(2^{m(p^k-1)}-1)$. Write $m(p^k-1)=(p-1)\ell$. Then $2^{m(p^k-1)}-1=2^{\ell (p-1)}-1$ is divisible by $2^{p-1}-1$, which is divisible by $p^2$. So the number of $n$-periodic elements with period divisible by $p$ is divisible by $p^2$. Since by induction the number of $n'$-periodic elements is divisible by $p^2$ for every proper divisor of $n$ divisible by $p$, we deduce that the number of elements of period $n$ is also divisible by $p^2$. So $T$ really has a 1093rd power in the full group of permutations, and 1093 is the smallest number greater than one with this property! But it's unclear [now answered negatively below] if we can find this permutation in the group of self-homeomorphisms, or even in the group of topological group automorphisms of $(\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z})^\mathbf{Z}$. 

Here's a classical construction. Fix a sequence $(s_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}$ of nonzero real numbers in $[-\pi,\pi]$. On $\mathbf{C}^\mathbf{N}$, define a linear automorphism by $T((x_n))=(e^{is_n}x_n)$. Note that the unique fixed point of $T$ is 0. Endow $\mathbf{C}^\mathbf{N}$ with the $\ell^2$-"norm", allowing infinite values. Then $T$ preserves this norm. In particular, it permutes the cosets of $\ell^2$, the subspace of elements in $\mathbf{C}^\mathbf{N}$ with finite norm, and the restriction of $T$ to any of this coset is an isometry. Now assume that $(s_n)$ is in $\ell^2$. Since $e^{is_n}=1+is_n+o(s_n)$, we deduce that $T(1)-1\in\ell^2$. Thus $T$ maps the coset $V=1+\ell^2$ into itself, and thus induces a (surjective) self-isometry of $V$. Define a length function on $\mathbf{Z}$ by $f(n)=\|T^n(1)-1\|$. (Length function is the axioms that you call norm, except that nonzero elements are allowed to have zero length). Since no power of $T$ fixes 1, we see that this length is indeed nonzero outside zero. Since $T$ has no fixed point and $V$ is isometric to a Hilbert space, $T$ has unbounded orbits (by Jung's center lemma); in particular, the above length function is unbounded. To ensure that the length is non-discrete, we need stronger hypotheses on $(s_n)$. Say, $s_n=2\pi/(\max(2,n)!$. Then it is easy to check that $T^{n!}(1)$ tends to 1, and hence the length $f(n!)$ tends to 0. If one wishes a more explicit argument argument avoiding the center lemma, one can replace the constant sequence 1 by the sequence c=(n), and keep the same choice of $(s_n)$, so $\|T(c)-c\|<\infty$, and define $f'(n)=\|T^nc-c\|$. Then the $n$-th coordinate of $T^{n!/2}c$ is $-n$. So for $n\ge 2$, $f'(n!/2)=\|T^{n!/2}c-c\|\ge 2n$, and hence $f'$ is unbounded. The argument showing that the length of $n!$ tends to zero is essentially the same computation.
