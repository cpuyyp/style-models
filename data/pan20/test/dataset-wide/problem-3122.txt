The Quango (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation) was active from 1969 to 1980. This period represented the largest jump forward in metrication since the process began. 

What would have been the result if the members of the Quango were elected officials, answerable to their constituents? Compare to the Metrication Process for the same time frame in the US. 

The USMB in the US reported that they were unable to bring about change because they lacked the Congressional mandate necessary to bring about national conversion. Translation: They did not have enough power to force the people to incur the costs of switching. It is clear that in both of these cases that the cost to switching to metric system was quite high, and individuals are unwilling to foot the costs unless it is by force. Indeed, it seems that they had a considerable economic advantage to staying with their existing systems. 

These Quangos are non-governmental organizations to which the government gives power and funding. Because these Quangos are non-governmental and somewhat autonomous, they can exert power against the will of the people and the people have very little recourse. These Quangos appear to be a failed experiment in autocracy, as the UK is in the process of defunding and eliminating many of them. There have also been accusations that the appointments to them are based more upon political patronage than qualifications, and they are very expensive for the services they provide. In his recollection of his time serving as head of the Metrication Quango, Jim Humble, appears to validate the 'metrication by force' hypothesis 

The answer is quite simple. Freedom. In the United States individuals are free to choose whichever system they want to use, and the government does not yet have enough power to force them to use a different system. So the milk bottler that has been bottling his milk in gallons, half gallons, quarts, pints and half pints will continue to do so, because that is what he is tooled for, and that is also what his customers demand and understand. He has a considerable economic advantage to continue using the same units. We have a constitution that is supposed to limit the power of the government, and so far that has prevented a switch of units by fiat. In order to understand this answer, it is instructive to look at the metrication process in Britain. All it takes is a little research into this Britain's history with the metric system to see that this question is kind of based upon a false premise. I have found news articles lamenting the fact that Britain uses a mixture of imperial and metric units (Will British people ever think in metric? $URL$ I recall a time I was visiting one of my English friends from college. I sat down by him on the bed and my weight created a depression, pulling him toward me. He jumped up and exclaimed: "Good Lord, you must weigh 16 stone!". He was spot on by the way, that is almost exactly my weight. Ok, so now back to the history. Below is an excerpt from wikipedia on the Metrication of the U.K. ($URL$ 

Lucifer was not the name of the king in Isaiah 14. As your linked Wikipedia article mentions, it's debated which king of Babylon is referenced in the passage. It names Nebuchadnezzar, Nabonidus, and several Assyrian kings as possibilities. So where does "Lucifer" come from? So where did "Lucifer" come from? Let's look at Isaiah 14:12 in a literal English translation of the Hebrew: 

I thought for sure I learned this in school, but I can't find any reference to it online. The basic idea I remember is that for one reason or another the Ayatollah and his followers believed furniture to be evil, or at least un-Islamic, and convinced his countrymen to burn all the furniture they owned. I searched Google trying to find explanations of the phenomenon (wanting to know the basis of the belief) and found not even a reference to it having happened. Did it happen? Did something similar happen (just chairs and not tables, for instance)? Is my recollection mistaken? 

What was the average height (from the foundation) of each of the two temples? How tall was the highest point (from the foundation) of each of the two temples? How high above sea level was each of the two temples? 

In the original Hebrew, "shining one" is הֵילֵל. When the Bible was translated into Latin, that was rendered "Lucifer." For some reason, the translators of the KJV carried that translation over as though it were a proper noun, when it simply means "shining one" or "morning star" literally, a possible reference to Venus. So why have Christians applied the verse to Satan if it was about the king of Babylon? No one disputes that it is about the king of Babylon -- who is not named Lucifer -- but some believe that God's rebuke to the king of Babylon is identifying him allegorically with Satan. Not that he is Satan, but that as an evil one, he can be identified with Satan. They point out two New Testament verses (in Luke 10 and Revelation 12) speak of Satan "falling" from heaven. They also point out that verses 13 and 14 sound similar to the devil's words in Genesis 3: "You shall be as God." Not all Christians believe Isaiah 14 refers to the devil in any capacity. John Calvin and Martin Luther both spoke out against that interpretation. So to sum up: 

The critical factor all these answers leave out: The Black Death. The Plague of Justinian swept through the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires a few generations before Islam. On the Byzantine side, the reduction in manpower available for warfare was near 90%. The damage to the economies of both empires made it unlikely they'd rebuild the population losses quickly enough, and, as @user64617 pointed out, the two were frequently at war with each other anyway. As to where I get the "90% reduction" figure: Before the Plague, Justinian had sent Belisarius to conquer Italy. Belisarius frequently requested more troops, as cities came over to the Empire's side and he needed to garrison them. He'd request 10,000 -- and get 1,000. After the Plague, Belisarius was again sent to Italy, to fix some problems other generals had created and, if possible, continue the conquest. Again, he'd request 10,000 additional troops -- but this time, all he'd get would be 100. The political events between the two phases did not involve Justinian -- he was sick with the plague -- and his personal attitude towards Belisarius, and his intent to rebuild the Empire, had not changed. (This doesn't mean 90% of the population died; it means enough people died that 90% of those who would have been available for the armies instead were needed for farming, shipping, trades, etc.) Sources: Belisarius, the Last Roman General by Ian Hughes; Justinian's Flea by William Rosen. 

Keep in mind that "heavy military ships" were rare -- most galleys were triremes or smaller designs -- biremes, penteconters, liburna. Their construction was well within the capabilities of small ports, and manning them took 50 or so crew -- also within the capabilities of small ports and pirate bands. They only had to be faster than merchant ships, and just about any lightly-loaded galley with a fresh crew could manage that. And the differences between civilian and military ships were narrow, at times. The Greek penteconter was BOTH. 

Yes, they had dedicated engineers for siege engines and works. Simple fortifications were handled by the legionnaires, but more complicated efforts had specialists. No, not every army had them. A specific example is Julian's army intended to attack Ctesiphon. In interest in speed, and because he did not believe Ctesiphon had walls, Julian did not take any engineers. Between the lack of any way to break the walls, and with the bulk of the Persian army marching their way, Julian was forced to abandon his attempt to sack Ctesiphon and attempt to get his army back to Roman territory.
