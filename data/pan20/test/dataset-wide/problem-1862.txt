As a general rule, I would strongly recommend against taking a nap in or around work, for several reasons. First, there's the potential to sleep through the afternoon. But more importantly, it would likely send a signal to your bosses that says "I don't take this position seriously enough to prepare myself for each day by getting enough sleep the night before". Maybe your position (or company) is different. A lot of companies now are pushing people to spend more time at work, and may provide places to take a quick power-nap so they can come back refreshed. But since you've been unable to find such a place, I wouldn't be doing this. One last thing - as an intern, you want to be giving the best possible impression to the company, because they may hire you themselves when you graduate, or else they'll serve as a reference for any other company you apply to. I don't feel that napping will give a positive boost to that impression. 

To keep it simple, I would probably just make a blank Excel spreadsheet for each person to fill out and send back; it would just have Monday-Friday along the top and each of your projects and other tasks along the sides. Simplify tasks as much as possible - just have one line for "other" to keep track of things like breaks, email, documentation; track vacation/sick days as one line as well. Let everyone know your expectations ("Keep track of things to the nearest hour/half-hour; I won't complain as long as you're tracking 40 hours a week", etc.). The point to make with everyone is that this is to help out with accounting, and it should take up no more than 5-10 minutes each day. Stress that you're not trying to catch anyone with this (you're not going to call someone in if their "other" category is 2 hours one day), but that you need the data to be as accurate as they can make it. 

Yes, you're within your rights to care or complain. Being treated differently based on your gender is illegal in the United States. From the EEOC website: 

Since you're relatively new, I would start by involving your team; assign items to the senior members of the group to come up with the categorization of important/not-important and urgent/not-urgent. Tell them not to take much time on each item, and to include their reasons why they decided that way (stress that it's not so that you can overrule them, but so that you can learn what's important and urgent). For those items that come back as not-important/not-urgent, assign them to a backlog and come back to them as you have time. Your questions #1, #2 and #4 are fairly generic, so here's my generic advice: 

I see one other option - you could try reaching out to Bob and telling him you don't think you'd be a good recommendation for him, as his performance wasn't at a level you were aiming for. (Presumably he knows this already.) I could see three outcomes: 1) This might nudge him to go back to the new company and get you off the hook somehow, perhaps by offering them a different coworker or manager from the ex-company to request a letter from. (The company might still request one from you, though, if they wonder why Bob doesn't want them to hear from you.) 2) He tells you "I understand, but I would like you to write one anyway". Then you're back where you started, but you would at least have the assurance that Bob won't be blindsided by a neutral-to-negative letter. 3) He gets upset that you won't write him a more positive letter. In that case, though, you can remind him of the performance issues he had while working for you, and tell him that due to those, he will either get a neutral-to-negative letter, or none at all. He can then choose from #1 or #2 above. 

However... None of these apply to you - you're essentially feeling "buyer's remorse" at having accepted a position that turns out not to be as great a deal as you originally thought. From the company's perspective, nothing has changed from last week to this week, so a discussion about "can I get an increase in pay" will seem to come from nowhere, and it's likely the company will both turn you down and gain a negative reputation of you as a result. 

The best solution I've seen so far is to explain what you've done in the past. Show that you've got a proven track record of success and overcoming adverse situations. Usually this is done by explaining problems you've faced in previous positions and how you worked through them. You're not trying to show that you did everything yourself; you're trying to show how you utilized the resources you had on hand (including other coworkers) to come to the solution. 

Get a lunchbox with an actual lock on it. Put it front and center in the fridge. Get others to do the same. Alternately, if you've got a laptop and a table in the lunchroom, work in there one day. Your presence should dissuade anyone from taking a lunch that isn't theirs. You can probably play it off as "there was a discussion near my desk and I wanted to find a quiet place to work". 

I don't think it's a good idea. If you're the one applying for a job, it's incumbent upon the company you're applying to to get back to you if they want to continue. In addition, telling them "I'll write/call back on <date>" has no affect if: a) they haven't started looking at applications by then, or b) the appropriate person isn't available to respond on that date. Ideally, they'd write you back right away to tell you "we won't have anything to tell you by that date; we'll contact you when we're ready", but even that requires them to parse every incoming cover letter immediately just to determine whether such a response is needed. You will have plenty of time to show punctuality and commitment throughout the interviewing process, but this just seems like a gimmick. 

Finally, as you pointed out, when you decide to switch jobs, you will usually have to explain why you're leaving a "cushy" job (not to mention possibly having to modify your standard of living to handle a smaller paycheck). 

These are usually the sorts of things I would ask during a phone or in-person interview. Your questions indicate that you've come from environments where pressure was high, or the business faced hard times - use those to explain your questions. For example, for #2: "My current company has fallen upon some hard times recently (hence my job search). What are your projections for your market? It looks fairly solid / potentially weak to me as an outsider. How would a downturn in the market affect the company, or my role?" (My second job was at a company that provided software tools to realtors - right around the burst of the housing bubble. I asked a question very similar to this.) #4: "Due to financial strain, my current company has had to lay off some workers and increase the workload for the rest of us. What is your company's position on work/life balance? I understand that late hours are occasionally necessary - have you found it to be more common at certain times of year, or around certain events?" #1: "What sorts of tools do you use? Is there a process for getting new tools or additional training? How do you handle the customer acquisition process?" As far as #3, I would expect them to be giving you the standard benefits spiel around the time of your interview anyway, so that you'd be able to factor that into your decision. 

It depends. I've seen job application forms that include a section that states something like "list all previous employment", and includes fine print like "any omission can result in loss of a job offer or termination of employment". In such a situation, if you left off those two positions, and they discovered the truth, you could technically lose your job as a result. Is it likely? Again, it depends. Many companies run an employment or background check prior to offering you the position. If you were paid via a standard 1099 or W-2, they may be able to discover it fairly easily. If you were paid under the table, it might be harder (though still not impossible). You'll have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of listing a position that's criminally connected versus intentionally submitting an incomplete job history. 

(The link comes from Jeff, who had an entire post talking about the benefits of multiple large monitors.) For #2, when it came time to upgrade PCs at my first job, one of my coworkers was given several test PCs and asked to gauge which of them were fast enough. He opened the largest code solutions we had in SourceSafe and measured how long it took to compile them on each machine. He was able to use that data to push for the department to upgrade to the best of the test PCs he'd been given, because it was able to compile in less than half of the time of the slower PCs, as well as being able to keep more files and projects open without interminable delays. For #3, you could try bringing in your own mouse & keyboard and show a similar productivity increase (albeit smaller); alternately, if your mouse/keyboard need replacement, you could simply ask for a small upgrade to the mouse/keyboard of your choice. A mouse & keyboard are relatively cheap compared to the costs of PCs or chairs. For #6, here's what Joel Spolsky had to say: 

It's possible the micromanaging is all a result of being behind and having a time crunch. If the team begins to deliver consistent results and hits some deadlines on time, the pressure may lessen. It's also possible that, under the new manager, this will be the new normal. Only time will tell. One last thing to keep in mind is that, while you don't want to quit, it's possible that the company could let you go. So starting a job search might be a good use of your free time anyway. (I have several colleagues who have remarked "I'm never not on the market; it's just a matter of how good the market has to be before I'd leave a given job".) 

Your best bet (if you're certain you want to stay with this company) is to wait until you have a firm offer in hand from the other company, then go to your company and ask them to match (or at the very least, to give you a written agreement to put you on a path to a similar salary in short order). What do I do then? Once you've gotten the final offer from the other company, sit down and compare what they're offering to what your current company gets you. Don't forget to take other things into account - are they farther away? Will you be expected to work longer hours? Are the benefits better/worse/the same? In the end, you may decide it's not worth switching jobs, and you turn the new company down; you may decide that it's so much better than your current position that you don't offer to let your company match; or you may decide that it's possible that your company could "sweeten the deal" enough to get you to stay. Decide at exactly what point that would be - 85% of the salary? 110%? Improved benefits? Know all of that before you go talk to your company, because you may not get a lot of time to decide once you're talking to them. Why wait for the final offer? A £10k+ raise is nothing to sneeze at, and it's entirely possible that your company will realize that they can't match your requested salary, or they don't want to increase your salary any faster than you're already planned for, and they'll let you go immediately. If at that point the other company hits a snag with your application and goes with someone else, you'll be out in the cold. On the other hand... Why offer to let them match? Your company seems to be telling you they have no intention of paying your "market rate" (which is defined by what other companies are willing to pay you). If everything else is similar at the other company (benefits, company outlook, company culture, etc.), the other company should have a leg up because you're starting there at a much higher rate - a rate which, at your current company, you might not get to for years. But I really like this company! Fair enough. Only you can decide whether the increased pay at the new company outweighs whatever benefits, including intangible ones, you have at your current job. Best of luck! 

Quick aside - does your current boss have any reason to say anything like what he's saying? Have you left work 5 minutes early? Were you late for any meetings? Have you missed a deadline, even if it's just by an hour? Anything concrete he can point to, no matter how small, is potential evidence he could bring up. Be sure that you're dotting your i's and crossing your t's the rest of your time under this boss. If there is something, then you need to address that, with both your current boss and your new one. To your current boss, 

3) If the job otherwise changes significantly (such as a 40-hours-per-week job becoming a 60-hours-per-week job, or changing from a day shift to a night shift) 

You'll likely get one of three responses: 1) "Nope. We're stuck with the new cubicles." (Possibly in the form of "I already asked the higher-ups, and gave them those reasons, and the request was denied.") 2) "Oh, I didn't realize it would affect A, B, and C. I'll work on getting the cubicles expanded." 3) "Oh, I didn't realize it would affect A, B, and C. I'll go back to the higher-ups and see if that's enough to get the old cubicles back." (Followed by either answer 1 or 2 when he hears back.) An additional note - it's possible that, if this is a topic that's been discussed quite a lot, and the general consensus is "it's not going to change", then bringing it up with your managers again could give them a slightly negative view of you ("does he understand when to let things go?"). Depending on your relationship with them, you may want to factor that in when deciding whether to speak with them. Should I stay or should I go? As far as whether you should find another employer, ask yourself how this change affects your overall picture of this employer. Generally "I'm stuck in a too-small cubicle" is in the "con" column of your pro/con list, but if you've otherwise got a lot of "pro's" (like good pay, good experience, good benefits, etc.), then you may decide that it's worth putting up with a smaller cubicle in exchange. Or you might decide that it's the straw that breaks the camel's back. Only you can determine that. 

Document The first thing you need to do is to keep track of the things she's trying to use to discredit you. It sounds like you're already doing this, with regard to the sales relationship that she tried to sour, but continue to jot them down somewhere private. (By the way, unless her remarks cross the line into "hostile workplace" territory (e.g., talking about your gender, race, religion, etc.) or are otherwise significantly demeaning, don't keep too close track of things like "she makes rude remarks towards me". You can mention it in passing, but the focus of your issue needs to be "I'm unable to do my job to my best abilities because I'm being hindered".) Keep track of the occasions when she's taken excessive amounts of time to respond to your requests; write down when you're being pushed to do things "incorrectly" and it costs you extra time. Essentially, if you think you might be asked "what happened with customer X?" and the answer is "I'm waiting on [her]" or "I did it [her] way and spent extra time doing something that didn't end up working out", have something you can point to that backs you up. Speak to your Manager Once you have a few examples of things she's done, ask your manager what you should do in these situations. Does he want you to let him know if you've been waiting on her for more than a certain amount of time? Does he want you to tell him when you're being asked to deviate from your normal workflow? Often including your manager as a CC on an email can help to speed up a slow process - but make sure he's expecting it first! Getting your manager to see the impediments is crucial to moving forward. If he doesn't think there's a problem, then you're unlikely to get help fixing it. If the solution is as simple as "keeping him informed via email", he may be willing to go along with it so that he can see the level of the problem for himself. Stay Professional The absolute most important thing you have to do is to stay professional. No matter her reaction or comment, you must stay above it at all times. Don't forward a nasty email from her to anyone just to say "see what I have to put up with?" Don't make a list of "nasty things she's called me this month". Do your best to put it aside. You could attempt to have your manager overhear some of her verbal remarks by having him listen in on a call, or mention a particularly rude email in the hopes that he'll ask to see it, but you should also assume that she's going to do the same, and don't give her anything to use against you to portray you as the unprofessional one. (Optional) Recruit Allies Are you the only one waiting excessively for responses? If not, you could get additional support by having other coworkers also mention to your supervisor (or theirs) that they're being similarly hindered by her actions. Are you the only one she's rude to? If one coworker is being rude to a large group, the group can speak up and mention that "[she] doesn't seem to get along well with any of us". Conflict between two people can sometimes be brushed off as minor, but conflicts with an entire group / department / division are harder to ignore. Still, everyone involved has to stay professional; if anyone in the group gets frustrated and lashes out, it gives her complaints more weight and lessens your position. Last, but not least... As much as possible, be excellent at your job. Have clients gushing about you. Have your other coworkers talking about how helpful you are. When you become a strong part of the company's success, your opinions will hold more weight, and her ability to demean you will decrease. If you're successful, and you talk to your supervisor about ways to become more successful, they're usually happy to help. Dealing with interpersonal issues is often the worst part of the work world. Good luck.
