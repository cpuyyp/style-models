I wonder how to add more weight to a dumbbell. Adding more plates of fewer weight or fewer plates of higher weight? With bigger plates the diameter grows and so will the minimum distance the dumbbells will have to your body. With more plates on the handle however the center of the handle itself will be farther away from the body - eg. when placing the plates on the shoulders while doing front squats - and it might be harder to balance the dumbbell as the weight is farther away from the center as well. I already bought rubberized cast iron plates, not those concrete filled plastic plates, as reviews on amazon complained about the overall size of the latter. Do I have to worry about this at all when buying weights for my dumbbells? As per request I drew a diagram: 

I am finally able to do 5 pull ups. As this puts me in the optimal rep range for strength gains I thought about adding weight to stay in that rep range. I do my exercises at home, that's why I thought about loading a backpack with dumbbell plates. I really like the effect pull ups have on my core (I often had sore abs after a day of "greasing the grove"-style exercise). While weights in a backpack increase the resistance on my upper body, I fear that my core training is neglected. Are my worries justified? How do different positions of weights (on the back, the chest, around the hip, on the feet) impact pull ups? 

As you can read from the comments, with the information you gave it is not easy to say why exactly you are on a plateau. There are several things you could do: 

I wonder if this is true in for my case or only in relation to the proposed program behind that link. My goal is to achieve upper body strength (strength-endurance mainly), not to complete one or both of the programs. I only use them as some means of progression, I do other exercises besides them for other muscle groups. My question really only is about dips vs push ups. My questions are: What is the real difference between dips and push ups? Under which circumstances should I choose which exercise? What would be an effective method to combine both of my programs? (eg one week dips, one week push ups) 

As discussed in the comments, if you want to lose weight, adjust your diet. I wont delve into this, but focus on diverse, protein rich meals. Try to bring the carbohydrates (wheat, sugar, rice, potatoes) down a bit, if possible. Cardio exercises like running on a Treadmill or Elliptical are good for your endurance, but as they drain a lot of energy you might consider to move them to the end of your workout. I would only do one of both on each given day, as the movement is quite similar and I doubt there is any benefit switching the machines compared to doing one exercise longer. If you have a stationary bike, it might be advantageous to switch, as the movement is different. You weight-exercises look a bit unplanned to me, I think you are using machines here mostly, but some of the lifts look like you have a barbell or dumbbells available. I'd recommend you to look into free weights lifting programms such as Starting Strength or StrongLifts. They only use a small set of barbell exercises, but as those exercises are compound lifts you will engage your whole body doing these. You don't even have to use the gym every day, only three days are enough to build muscle. If you work out too often you risk overtraining. I know how compelling it is to work out every day, especially when you've just begun and can't wait to lose those pounds. But again, losing weight comes from the right diet, building muscles comes from exercising. And to build muscles you need to rest. By the way: you complain about belly-fat and do crunches, note there is no such thing as spot reduction. Just saying this, because a lot of people who have belly-fat think the abdominal muscles and the abdominal fat are somewhat related. 

If you drink 500ml of beer, which normally has around 5-8% of alcohol, this is around 25g-40g of ethanol. This amount is at or below the value of the second study, depending on your body weight of course. There are of course very different types of beer and by that its contents will vary. Additionally alcohol-free beer exists that doesn't bring the downsides normal beer does, but it still brings the benefits. Some alcohol-free beers are actually marketed as isotonic in Germany. As an anecdote: The Vattenfall Cyclassics, an annual bike race in Hamburg, has Erdinger (a beer brewery from Bavaria) as a sponsor, and both alcohol-free and normal Erdinger Weissbier is well received after the race both by the crowd and the racers. 

Cardio primarily means biking for some hours (50-100km) in the afternoon. Depending on my mood and the weather I sometimes add half an hour of swimming in the morning. Strength means Stronglifts 5x5, as I just restarted it the weight ranges are in the lower area (around 30-40kg depending on the exercise). I add some bodyweight exercises (push ups, pull ups, headstands, planks etc), yoga and other cardio every now and then when I am bored. The race is two weeks from now on a Saturday, how should I reduce the training intensity? When to stop adding weight to 5x5? On which day should I stop lifting completely? Note: I know this workout program smells like overtraining, please ignore that fact. I know it myself, I can currently keep up to it and am more interested in the fun of exercising than gains. Additionally I can't keep it up for much longer as soon as I have to study again. Note2: Ignore that this question is about a specific event, simply answer like the event is still 2 weeks from now, as there will always be another race two weeks from now. 

I'm on a more or less intense training regime in the last few weeks. As I have a bike race coming up in two weeks I need to find the time to begin slowing down my training and start a short resting phase before the race. 

I had the same problem a few weeks ago when I was looking to make my routine a bit more well rounded. At the moment I am doing: 

When browsing around the various articles linked in answers here, I keep stumbling over rope jumping in articles or blog post. I was never good at rope jumping, at least that's what I thought. Actually I never tried to do it. The last time I did it, I was a kid and gave up pretty quickly. Looking around on amazon gave me the expected results, far too many variations, far too many decisions to make for an item I don't even know how to use properly. There are different materials for the rope, I've seen nylon, leather and steel. Also of course different lengths, how do I know which length is right for me? Some ropes are called speed ropes, is this just another name or is it really a difference? There are weighted grips available and grips that explicitly mention that the grips are not weighted. I am somehow reminded of jogging with ankle weights here, which supposedly isn't useful. Does it matter how the rope comes out of the grip: straight or sideways? Some grips have ball bearings for the rope, sounds reasonable. To take a break just because the rope is twirled wouldn't be motivating, but is this really a concern? Last thing I spotted was that there are indoor and outdoor ropes, I would definitely start indoor, but I would want to go outside, are there ropes that can do both or should I simply buy one for each purpose? They aren't that expensive after all. 

No, I doubt that running with every footwear is safe. Of course this depends on the level of training you have with that specific footwear, but in general I would not recommend running in high-heels, clown shoes or diving fins. And while you probably can run in slippers or flip-flops I wouldn't recommend that either. The footwear is not made to hold on to your foot, especially not when twisting the feet. I've ran in sub-optimal shoes before, hiking shoes, leather dress shoes and others. This is possible and it primarily depends on the stiffness of the sole how comfortable the running will be, and while you maybe won't injure your knees when you adopt a forefoot strike in these, compared to a heel strike; you need to take other risks, like slipping, into account. Your ankles might be at higher risk, too, as the stiff sole doesn't attach to an uneven surface as a flexible one would do, which your feet could compensate. It depends on how you want to assess safety and which kind of injuries you want to look at. If you just look at the issues normally linked with running (bad knees, etc) you might have the same injury rates comparing barefoot running with running in slippers. But running in slippers introduces new risks: You could stumble over the flexible tip of the shoe if you land in a bad angle, which wouldn't happen either with minimalist shoes or running completely barefoot. The holder in the from between the toes might cut into your flesh badly, which wouldn't happen barefoot or with shoes either. You can do a lot of stupid things, without ever getting injured, I have done so myself. But I would not recommend anyone to do the same without giving the warning that I might have been just lucky. 

It is OK and normal to be hungry after activity. If you really want and need to eat, don't force yourself not to, this probably wont work. But there is a simple trick you could and should try: Eat slow. Hunger is a feeling that your brain produces, after you started eating it takes some time for the feeling to be satisfied, the amount of food you actually ate only plays a little role (you are likely to eat too much). Eating slow reduces the amount of food you eat before the hunger feeling is gone. If you think you are unable to or have no idea how to start eating slow, you can force yourself into the habit by snacking whilst preparing your meal. Eg when I eat pineapple yoghurt, I always snack some of the pineapple while preparing. You snack some nuts while you prepare your meal, too. Just don't munch them all. Addressing your main problems: 

I am just starting to incorporate some dumbbell exercises in my workout. I try to reduce pauses between exercises to get more stuff done in the same time and spend less time waiting. At the moment I am doing a routine of three different exercises: hammer curl, shoulder press and front squats. All 5x5, each dumbbell loaded with 2.5kg and 2.4kg bar weight. I wonder how to order them and which (dis)advantages each order would have. 

tl;dr: Try to be creative; If you are stuck and your approach doesn't seem to work any longer, change it. 

"Every exercise is about as good as another for losing weight" Good in terms of what? If you compare the exercise burning thousands of Calories per hour that you totally dislike, with the exercise you can do for hours without losing the fun which burns only a quarter of it, which one is better here? I think thats what that sentence might want to tell you; it does not matter which exercise you chose as long as you are exercising. 

I am familiar with two positions to keep the hands when doing body weight squats, either in front of your body with arms straight forward or slightly bent or behind the neck. Does this make a difference? Does it make any difference at all where my hands are at when squatting? Why not just let the arms hang down the sides? 

I'd recommend you to get a pull up bar, as I think the pull up comes closest to real climbing. The models for the door frame are not that expensive. But it might be complicated to find the right door to make you still able to watch TV and I doubt you want to glue a ceiling mounted pull up bar to your living room. So without a pull up bar, try inverted rows below a table. I did it before I got my pull up bar and it was a nice help progressing into the pull up movement. You can do the inverted rows with both grips, underhand and overhand. With the underhand grip you can increase intensity by lying in front of the table and trying to bring your hands behind your head, effectively lifting your head above the plate of the table. The overhand grip comes closer to climbing movement and grips. Additionally I'd drop the curls. I think it would be better to spend time doing compound instead of isolation exercises. You can still use the dumbbells to increase resistance doing certain body weight exercises. Eg if you are already doing body weight squats, you could do dumbbell front squats instead.
