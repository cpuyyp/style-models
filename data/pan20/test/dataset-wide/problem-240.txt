Hoo boy. This is one serious orbital mechanics problem. The most energy-efficient method of getting a spacecraft (or, in this case, an asteroid) from one roughly-circular orbit into another is with a Hohmann transfer. For moving Ceres into Mars's orbit, this will entail firing thrusters on Ceres directly opposing its direction of motion so that its perihelion (its closest approach to the Sun) just touches Mars's orbit, waiting until Ceres reaches that point, then firing the thrusters again to circularize the orbit. In order to actually have Ceres fall into Mars's orbit, though, the maneuver must be initiated at exactly the right time, so that when Ceres completes its half-of-an-ellipse transfer orbit, Mars will be right there waiting for it. Ceres has an orbital period of 4.60 Earth years, while Mars's year is only 1.8808 Earth years. They line up about every Mars year and a half, and the transfer itself will take less than half of a Ceres year. If there were rockets planted on Ceres' surface right now, that means Ceres could be in orbit around Mars within 8 Earth-years in the worst-case scenario, where the most recent launch window just recently closed. There's plenty of time to prepare. The most important quantity in orbital mechanics is delta-V, which basically just measures the amount by which your spacecraft (or asteroid) needs to change its speed, which, in turn, determines how much fuel you need, how much that fuel and the engines used to burn it will weigh, how much more fuel you need to move all that fuel around, etc. It's used a bit like how distances are used when traveling around the Earth. That Wikipedia page gives the delta-V for the Hohmann transfer as follows: $$\Delta v_1 = \sqrt{\frac \mu {r_1}} \left( \sqrt{\frac {2r_2} {r_1+r_2}} - 1 \right)$$ $$\Delta v_2 = \sqrt{\frac \mu {r_2}} \left( 1 - \sqrt{\frac {2r_1} {r_1+r_2}} \right)$$ where $\Delta v_1$ is the delta-V needed to put the asteroid into the transfer orbit, $\Delta v_2$ is the delta-V needed to synch that orbit up with Mars, $\mu$ is the mass of the Sun multiplied by the gravitational constant G, $r_1$ is the radius of Ceres' current orbit, and $r_2$ is the radius of Mars's orbit. Plugging those equations into Wolfram|Alpha, we get $\Delta v_1$ = 2.814 km/s and $\Delta v_2$ = 3.272 km/s, for a total of 6.086 km/s of delta-V. That's actually not a whole lot, in astrodynamics terms. It takes more than that to reach low Earth orbit. But Ceres is big. It has a mass of 9.393×10$^{20}$ kg, so changing its velocity by 6.086 km/s would require an impulse of 5.76×10$^{24}$ newton-seconds. In order for a Hohmann transfer to work, the rocket burns at the beginning and end of the maneuver should ideally be instantaneous. This, of course, is impossible without destroying the asteroid and killing everyone on it; but nuclear pulse propulsion is probably about the closest you'll get without going well beyond the near future. The engineers of Project Orion concluded that a nuclear pulse drive based on their design could potentially reach a specific impulse of up to 100,000 seconds. Specific impulse, by the way, is a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine. A specific impulse of 100,000 seconds means that a sufficiently-refined Orion drive could support the weight of its own fuel in Earth gravity for about 100,000 seconds. The amount of fuel actually required to pull off this maneuver can be derived from the infamous Rocket Equation: $$\Delta v = I_{sp} \cdot g \cdot \ln \left(\frac {m + m_p} m\right)$$ where $I_{sp}$ is the specific impulse, $g$ is Earth's gravity, $m$ is the mass of Ceres, in this case, and $m_p$ is the mass of the thermonuclear bombs serving as propellant. Solving this for $m_p$ gives $$m_p = m \left(e^{\frac {\Delta v} {I_{sp} \cdot g}} - 1\right)$$ Invoking Wolfram|Alpha once again indicates that you'll need 2.72×10$^{18}$ kg of nuclear weapons to start the transfer orbit, and 3.16×10$^{18}$ kg of them at the end. And that's if you get someone to restock your asteroid-ship with the second batch of nukes midway through. Plus whatever you'd need to actually get the asteroid into orbit around Mars, which depends on how close you want it to orbit. Good luck! 

Easily. According to Wikipedia, telephone was patented in 1876; and the Industrial Revolution lasted from "about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840". That means that 104 years passed between the start of our Industrial Revolution and Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone. If you want a world in which Britain has been undergoing an industrial revolution for 60 years, but they haven't invented telephones yet, look no further than Earth. Do note that the Morse telegraph was patented in 1837, 77 years after 1760. There were earlier systems that allowed communication at the speed of light, most notable semaphore, but the Morse telegraph was the first to be commercially successful and receive widespread use. As for your other inventions: Automobiles came into their own in the late 1800s. If you want to stick strictly to technologies available in 1820 (and there is absolutely no reason that you need to), you might want to leave those out. The first closed-circuit television system was designed in 1942. As it was basically a collection of television cameras wired to send stream signals to a central control room, you're not going to have systems like it appearing before the inventions of radio and television. Film photography wasn't even functional yet in 1820 (with the oldest surviving photograph having been taken in 1826); however, photosensitive chemicals had been known to exist since 1720s, with silver chloride having been noted as particularly sensitive to light in 1777. So it's conceivable that photography could've been developed earlier. You won't get live feeds with film, but you might be able to hire someone to take pictures of people who are acting suspiciously. Newspapers. They've been around since the 1600s. No problem there. In summary: You absolutely could have a world in which an industrial revolution like our own British industrial revolution has been going on for sixty years, but in which nobody's designed a telephone. Our own world is an example of that. However, if you want to have all of the other technologies you mention, you might want to set your story a little later in time and/or handwave the development of some things a bit. 

About the only form of "action at a distance" that exists within modern physics that can operate operates on human scales is electromagnetism. Gravity really only does anything meaningful when masses comparable to planets are involved, and the strong and weak nuclear forces hardly do anything outside of atomic nuclei. Your question has shades of a kind of offbeat telekinesis idea I had a while back: A person that is (via magic) able to control electric fields with their mind. They could throw around copper hoops, then induce string electric currents flowing through them. The currents would create magnetic fields, turning the hoops into powerful electromagnets, which could then be used to attract or repel each other as needed. This doesn't need to be magic. If the hoops were equipped with some electronics and a power source (which may need to be handwaved a bit- these things need a lot of power), it would work just fine. Rather than a brain operating on the hoops directly, a remote control of some kind would keep track of where they are and what they need to be doing, and send them commands wirelessly. Or maybe the hoops communicate with each other directly, more like a hive mind. Also note that with rapidly oscillating magnetic fields, the hoops don't all need to be powered. As this video shows, enough A/C power pumped into a big coil of wire can levitate any random chunk of metal. Taking a hard-science approach to pyrokinesis might be more difficult. Plasma has free-floating positive and negative charges, and thus is an electrical conductor. You wouldn't be able to guide it around very well with electric fields, though, since the electrons would go one way and the positive ions the other. However, both charges will tend to follow magnetic field lines lines, as can be seen in solar prominence and some kinds of fusion reactors, so you might be able to get somewhere that way. Other than electric arcs, lasers, or actual flamethrowers, I dunno. 

Having blood that is literally a metallic silver color while also transporting nutrients and oxygen is going to be difficult, if not impossible. The accepted answer to this question provides a list of different oxygen-carrying proteins and their colors when oxygenated and deoxygenated. The closest are probably hemocyanin, which is colorless in the veins, and coboglobin, which is colorless in the arteries. Other proteins not listed here might give a grayish or milky-white color; but I don't think there's any for an aqueous solution to give you a metallic sheen. However, who's to say it has to be an aqueous solution? You're already talking about raw magic energy here, so these creatures' blood could literally be liquid mercury and it wouldn't make any less sense from a scientific perspective. Or liquid gallium, if you're worried about them poisoning anyone they bleed on, although their home environment would have to be a bit warmer than Earth for that to be feasible. Gallium melts at 29.76 °C, between room temperature and human body temperature. Alternatively, their blood might be a normal color when in their circulatory system, but turn silver upon exposure to air. Much as exposure to air triggers human platelets to release sticky proteins and start coagulating, it might trigger your creatures' blood to produce a film of some material that looks like silver foil. I'm not sure what that material would be or how it would work, although a strange type of atmosphere* could do it. Or it could just be magic. *If your story happens to take place on a world with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (such as this one, or any old gas giant), it could be silver ions in the blood being reduced by the hydrogen in the atmosphere and precipitating out as silver metal. However, a creature from such a planet would have great difficulty surviving for very long on Earth without a space suit. 

Owls appear to have pretty fuzzy feathers so they can fly silently; your creatures could use fuzzy fur for the same purpose. I have no way to know if the arrangement you've described would work better than any other arrangement... but fur has weight and doesn't contribute to lift, so there's evolutionary pressure for it to be as short and sparse as possible, while also being as silent, aerodynamic, and insulating as needed. 

StephenG has already covered most of the reasons why your sapient species might be plausible, so I'll instead focus on how it might evolve. I expect that your aliens will likely resemble owls more than anything else. Owls, after all, are predators with good night vision (like cats), excellent hearing (like rabbits), and the ability to hoot. So, to start off with, you need owl-like bunny-cats. I'd need to know a lot more about the ecology of your planet to determine whether that makes sense, but I don't think it really needs any explanation. Bats are halfway there already. The real hurdle is this: how does a species evolve sapience? The current best-guess theory for how humans evolved sapience goes something like this: 

Sure. They evolved from nocturnal hunters. They'd have to have pretty good binocular night vision; while cat-like eyes are not the only way, they are one way to do it. 

Allowed... where? It sounds like you're working on a sci-fi setting where humans are starting to send manned missions to other planets. But how advanced is the medical technology? Can your doctors cure arbitrary infections on a whim, or are they limited to current medical tech, with varyingly-effective antibiotics? Also, who's doing the allowing? Is your setting's government making a conscious decision to not eradicate certain pathogens, or are you talking on more meta grounds about what sorts of pathogens make for a good setting? If we're talking about your setting's government, is letting certain diseases not be eradicated really the best way to keep the populace's immune systems from acting up? Many of the diseases you've listed require expensive treatments and carry a significant risk of death. There's really no need to subject your populace to that when there are so many mostly-harmless pathogens out there that can also do the job. I doubt there's really any need to expose them to anything more harmful than the common cold. And if you need to prepare them for a specific, more harmful pathogen, that's why vaccines exist. Alternatively, if you want your people to grow up in a truly sterile environment but still be able to survive in the outside world, you could resort to genetic engineering. Replicating the functions of all the symbiotic bacteria in and on the human body won't be easy, but with enough time and effort it should be doable. Likewise, programming the immune system to work properly even if not trained on a multitude of weak pathogens is surely possible with a similar amount of effort. 

As a matter of fact, so-called "space activity suits" have been in development since 1959, although they haven't had a whole lot of success yet. There aren't enough advantages to the models that have been produced so far to displace the existing gas-pressure-based spacesuits. Space activity suits work by pressing tight layers of fabric directly against the wearer's skin, rather than filling the suit with pressurized gas like current spacesuits do. In principle, this should permit much greater mobility than existing spacesuits do, but they're also much more difficult to get right and much more difficult to squeeze oneself into. Currently, there's a project at MIT to create a space activity suit consisting of a single layer of cloth set with stretchy cords to provide pressure, but as far as I know they haven't worked out all the kinks yet. 

An aquatic creature like a small dog makes me immediately think of the pinnipeds- seals and walruses. They're a little big to be small-dog-like, the smallest seals being around a meter long, but that's nothing a little evolution can't handle. At least pinnipeds have fur, unlike cetaceans. As an added bonus, they're in the dog-like half of the order Carnivora (as opposed to the cat-like half), although they're more closely related to bears, weasels, and raccoons than dogs. Seals have streamlined bodies and flippers, which is a step away from the ahuizotl's grasping forepaws. However, they could be an intermediate evolutionary step. Perhaps a population of raccoons found evolutionary pressure to take to the water and quickly evolved waterproof, seal-like fur, but have yet to lose their dextrous paws. A very long tail is easy; many carnivorans already have those (although no existing pinnipeds seem to). An extra hand at the end of it is much harder. There's really no reason I can think of for such a thing to evolve. Some animals, such as New World monkeys, already have prehensile tails, with which they can grasp things by wrapping their tails around them. This works well enough, so there's little evolutionary pressure for any more sophisticated hand to evolve and quite a bit of pressure for it not to. Hands are darn complex, and vertebrate tails have exactly none of the support structure required to make them work. Perhaps the ahuizotl has a simple prehensile tail, and the "extra hand" bit is nothing more than a myth. I'll get back to this in a minute. Mimicking human cries is easy enough. Just gotta have vocal chords that are the right shape. It's not likely that these things would evolve specifically to sound like humans, so we'll write this one off as a coincidence like how some hyena calls sound like human laughter. Drowning adult humans is... hard. Unless they're already incapacitated. Or drunk. Or can't swim. I am reminded of the evil carp of Dwarf Fortress, which were famous for their ability to provoke unsuspecting dwarves into leaping into rivers to their doom. Most humans, however, aren't stupid enough to leap into a river at the sight of something in the water lashing out at them. Especially if they can't swim. Anyway, this is where the prehensile tail comes back in. Maybe, instead of simply trying to drown humans, the ahuizotl simultaneously drowns and strangles its prey. The ahuizotl tricks unfortunate humans into falling into deep water, perhaps by grabbing at their feet and tripping them, then wraps its long, prehensile tail around the human's neck. The combination of suddenly being dumped into cold water and having a wet tail cinching down around your neck could well lead to panic and drowning in short order, especially if the victim can't swim. This could even contribute to the "extra hand" myth- to a terrified observer, this could well look like the ahuizotl was wrapping its hands around the victim's neck, much as one human would strangle another. Selectively eating, digesting, and getting something out of human eyes, nails, and teeth is... weird. Maybe there's some nutrient in those parts that the ahuizotl can't get any other way. But nails are just keratin, a protein found in larger quantities and in a much more accessible form in skin. And teeth are darn near impervious to all kinds of things. Maybe they need to harvest the special photoreceptor proteins from human retinas for some reason. Or maybe human teeth just make good gizzard stones? A bit far-fetched, since I'm having these thing evolve from mammals with their own teeth, but I'm running out of ideas here. Or maybe those parts just taste good and get eaten first, and every now and then somebody killed by one of these things gets pulled out of the river before the it gets a chance to eat anything else. This could lead people to believe that ahuizotls eat eyes, teeth, and nails, which could eventually morph into a myth that they only eat eyes, teeth, and nails.
