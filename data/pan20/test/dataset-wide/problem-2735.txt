That's an interesting line of inquiry. We certainly use our brains in different ways than our ancestors did. The fact that we can spend half our lives in school suggests we get a lot of use out of our brains. On the other hand, mind control (e.g. propaganda) is a terrible reality today - and it takes an enormous toll on people's minds. 

Kopp doesn't appear to be calling evil "good." Rather, it sounds like he's saying one can take an evil act and transform it into something good. However, it's more likely that he means one can take evil INTENTIONS and transform them into a good act instead of an evil act. But I'm just guessing. Can anyone explain what it means? 

There are so many variables to consider. I think it would be good to start with TWO words... 1) Let's define an evil person as one who has evil in his or her heart or mind. 2) Let's define a person who does "bad" things as flawed. (There are many other words that could work here.) An evil person (one who's evil on the inside) might be expected to do evil deeds. However, such a person could do good things for ulterior motives. Consider all the corporate gangsters who steal from society, then donate money to some cause and call themselves "philanthropists." A good person would similarly be expected to do good, but there are so many things that could cause them to do "bad" things. For example, a leader or politician might simply be unqualified for his or her position. They may perform a certain action based on faulty intelligence. In summary, I make a distinction between thoughts or intentions and actions, bearing in mind that people can be classified good or evil not just on what they do but what they don't do. (When's the last time you heard St. Bill Gates condemn war, for example?) However, I got a little confused by what you wrote in the last couple paragraphs. The word corruption can be confusing. In the broad sense of the term, a rusty pipe or worn gasket can be said to be corrupted. In that sense, incompetence can be conflated with corruption, which may in turn be interpreted as evil. However, I usually equate corruption with wrongdoing, which is clearly "evil." If a person is profiting from their wrongdoing or corruption, then they're presumably motivated by greed, and we might also assume they're aware that they're exploiting people. The title of your post is a little confusing, by the way (to me, at least). How about "Can an evil person do the right thing?" or "Can one do the right thing and still be evil?" Or did I misinterpret what you're asking? EDIT: A couple important questions to ask are 1) what was the person's motive, and 2) how did the person benefit from his or her decision or action? 

What kind of logical fallacy is this, if any? A person (Mr. A) complains about climate change. A critic (Mr. B) replies, "You own a car, so you can't complain." Mr. B's argument is that anyone who owns a car uses fossil fuels. Therefore that person contributes to climate change, which makes him or her a hypocrite for complaining about climate change. Of course, MILLIONS of people are virtually forced to either own cars or ride the bus. They aren't advocating for a return to horse and buggy days. What they want is a sensible approach to mitigating climate change, like encouraging mass transit and regulating industry. 

In fact, the ANSWERS push personal agendas. It's clear what's going on here. I asked a question that's politically incorrect, a question that no one wants to answer. So if you want to close it, do it honestly. The problem isn't my question, it's the fact that no one can answer it. ORIGINAL QUESTION When I was a teacher, I was stabbed in the back (to put it politely) by many school and union officials. I went through a period of enormous anger and frustration - as well as confusion. Should I let my anger at these people consume me, or should I just forgive them? Here's the catch: I wasn't their only victim. They also abused other teachers as well as parents and children. I have thus come to feel that forgiving them would be criminal; I have a moral obligation to hate these people and do everything I can to bring them to justice. Note: On request, I edited my question to include a few details. By "stabbed" in the back, I'm referring to thinks like harassment, insults and threats not just from school officials but from the media and my own union. They also play games with people's files (evaluations, etc.) and paychecks. They can easily ruin people's careers and reputations. In fact, I know one teacher who was driven out of Seattle, and I know of one or two who committed suicide. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I actively fought back, creating several political websites and running for public office several times. Though it's pretty hard to hold the ruling class accountable, I have had some minor victories. I believe I was instrumental in getting several school officials transferred or reassigned, and one "journalist" I attacked is no longer writing about education. I've also talked to a couple public officials face to face who were very irate about "the bad things" I was saying about them on my website. And the best is yet to come. ;) Unfortunately, it's never been more than a one-man battle, because the public ignorance, apathy (and other things) is simply unbelievable. In fact, that's what motivated me to start studying the cognitive sciences, politics, etc.; I want to figure out what makes people's minds work the way they do. Anyway, can someone help me plug my personal philosophy regarding forgiveness into the philosophical spectrum? What great philosophers would agree or disagree with me? Is there a term for my belief? 

I THINK that translates to "I'm a member of my family, therefore, my familial relationship is going to create a conflict with my nationality." Of course, that isn't necessarily so. It would be more accurate to say, My family COULD create a conflict with my nationality. Also, the word "level" suggests some kind of hierarchy, apparently based on number. For example, family > nationality > human race. Though that's certainly a valid thing to ponder, it might be more fruitful to think in terms of overlapping associations or spheres, such as families, clubs, political parties, graduating classes, nationalities, races, etc. We could then summarize, various groups can either reinforce or undermine our bonds with other groups. 

I'm struck by the similarity between fallacies and cognitive biases. For example, there's a bandwagon bias and a bandwagon fallacy. Can anyone tell me if anyone has created a chart or system that matches fallacies with their most closely related counterparts among cognitive biases? In other words, if someone reads a statement and declares, "Aha, a red herring fallacy!" they might next determine that the red herring fallacy exploits a particular cognitive bias. 

In other words, it's a two-edged sword. I then pointed out some of the obvious benefits of technology (e.g. longer lifespans, electricity and ice cream). I also pointed out some of bad things, such as overpopulation, environmental degradation and people who are biologically less fit than our distant ancestors in many respects. If World War III shut down medical services, millions of people who suddenly found themselves deprived of critical medicines and aids would die. In summary, it's hard to argue that humanity has been biologically enhanced by technology. 

Everyone knows the universe isn't fair, yet many, if not most, people believe that we should strive for fairness. However, some people don't care about fairness, instead being led by greed and the principle "might makes right." Are there any notable philosophers who weighed in on this issue, on one side of the coin or the other? I believe the ancient Greek philosophers lived in a society where slavery flourished, so I'm guessing they didn't have the most refine concept of fairness. 

Science - focus on facts, logic and theory; yields proven facts Philosophy - greater focus on logic; yields philosophical theories and doctrines Spirituality - largely intuitive; yields a feeling of being connected with the universe that's very hard to explain or quantify; generally a much more personal, even solitary experience than science or even philosophy Religion - primarily faith-based and very politicized; used as a form of mind control to a far greater degree than science, philosophy or spirituality, though all can be subverted by propagandists 

A lot of famous "holy men," like Jesus and various biblical prophets, as well as monks are single and even celibate. Are a lot of famous philsophers - outside of religious figures - similarly single or celibate? If so, did any of them explain why they chose not to marry or have "normal" relationships? 

One key word to focus on is responsibility. Thousands of refugees from Southeast Asia settled in the U.S. Some oppressed minorities already living them in the U.S. viewed these newcomers as "outlanders" who didn't belong in the U.S. The irony is that the war in Vietnam played a major role in destabilizing the region. Indeed, the U.S. military destroyed many villages and impacted the environment through bombing and the use of Agent Orange. Of course, it can get far more complex. Suppose the U.S. and its allies create a proxy army (e.g. ISIS) and direct it to destabilize a country like Syria. Of course, citizens are told that ISIS is a pure Muslim extremist movement. Does a country allied with the U.S. have any responsibility for the carnage inflicted by ISIS? France and the U.S. played a major role in the destruction of Libya, and it could therefore be argued that they have an obligation to help the refugees. But what about a country that's allied with the U.S. or France politically or economically but didn't actively participate in the military invasion of Libya? One might take a closer look at that country's record. Did it speak out against the invasion of Libya in the media or in the UN? If the government didn't speak out, what about the citizens? Did they protest the invasion of Libya? It should also be pointed out that the fact that a country has many citizens who are homeless and starving flies in the face of endless war to begin with. How can it afford to invade one country after another if it can't feed its own people? Who's profiting from those wars? The same people who agitate the loudest against welcoming refugees? There are many factors to consider, but it all boils down to awareness/education and responsibility. 

(A fourth possibility, that Trump and the media are both speaking the truth, is logically impossible; someone has to be lying.) Believing that either Donald Trump (or any other recent president) or the media are honest is frankly absurd. If we consider the third theory, we can see the irony in Trump's dismissal of media coverage as "fake news." Part of the irony lies run the fact that Trump, though widely regarded as a liar, is actually speaking the truth here. The other irony is that even the most corrupt media can make it look like they're on our side by criticizing or pretending to oppose Trump. It would be interesting to attempt to count and identify all the logical fallacies at work here. Of course, Donald Trump isn't the only player here. "Fake news" is involved in some enormous propaganda exercises. In Seattle, a couple professors at the University of Washington teach a course on what's popularly referred to as "BS" (website). Ironically, they studiously avoid mentioning Seattle's biggest BS'ers. Like Trump and the media, they're an example of the pot calling the kettle black. In summary, fake news can be defined as a synonym for propaganda, but it's also a very elaborate mind game that attempts to portray some of the world's biggest liars as honest people, just as Bill Gates and other corporate tycoons are portrayed as "philanthropists." 

Anyway, is anyone aware of a philosophical statement or doctrine that might be the source of this quote? Or is this a better question for English.se?
