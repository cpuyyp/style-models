First we have thinking or emotions, and further we have necessity to get what we think it's necessary or to get what emotions force us to do something. Our necessity is our intentional to do something in line with at least our emotions and possibly our thinking. We can see our intentional when: 

I will try to analyze this argument using proposition dependency. But why must dependency of proposition? Because proposition must be associated with existences or it's meaningless, and how an existence related to other existence is through a dependency. Proposition dependency: 

Adjusting Level Imagine a basketball is being played by an untrained people - people A. This shows the freedom of moving the basketball as far as can be done by an untrained people generally. Now put this person A on the maintenance of another basketball trainer (assuming that person A will be trained by a basketball trainer and really affects person A), and let person A plays with the same basketball, and soon the basketball will have the possibilities more than before. It’s just a basketball. Secondly, this already trained person A will be trained by another people for further entertaining. Then person A will get even more expertise in playing basketball. Then the basketball will experience freedom greater than before. It’s just a basketball. For those who feel they have no free will, then he should link “the will” to something more powerful in the assumption to get more freedom than before. Someone should put the chances of the expansion of freedom to the wider domination who is considered to have the possibility of free will is much broader than anything, so it is enough to realize that freedom in the process of the future will be more extensive than what can be imagined. No matter whether you can select or all of them is in accordance with what should happen, the important thing is, we have to realize that free will is a process of exploration as far as strength within ourselves or as far as the extent of power that are considered higher than ourselves where we rely on it. From just a baskeball to display the impression of freedom just because it was propped on something that has the possibility of more widespread. Therefore if we want to get freedom better, then we must rely our hope to something that has the possibility of more widespread (I consider it God). 

So what should you rely on? The structure or the meaning inside the structure? Or both? it's up to you 

Our interactions are merely depends on where we put our perception. If we put our perception on material level *using our five senses), then we are stuck within our body and interact at this level (level of duality). But if we put our perception on different situation where we may call "emptiness" (our awareness are working outside of our five senses), then our awareness act as it should be on different situation, which is emptiness. Where our body (by our subconsciousness) are still following the law of physics, and where our awareness (our consciousness) follows another different law of nature (law of emptiness or etc). Law of emptiness, it's when our awareness are stretched closer to everything. It's like when the ice (our awareness) are melt within water but still maintain the temperature of the ice different to the temperature of the water (enough to keep our awareness). At this level, we perceive closer to the characteristic of water, and when we back from emptiness, we will understand closer to the characteristic of the water and we can apply it to everyday life with better chances than before (since we "CLOSER TO" know how the water works). 

Something is better because something gives us safety (with feeling secure) and pleasure (survival, happiness, excitement, satisfaction, and similar to these), wider than before and within consistency. The more for something gives us safety (with feeling secure) and pleasure wider than before and even longer on consistency, then it maybe considered better. Besides, do we have to be proud of just because of knowing something? No! Knowledge is knowledge, comparison is comparison, not less and not more, and it's useless, because we don't even know whether something is better or worst, until it is beneficial for us. Right?! 

Practical: This question to be specifically can be related to artificial intelligent. As i am working on project, creating logical framework for artificial intelligent, and i found an obstacle that had the sameness as represented by this question. This question can be related to artificial intelligent. But philosophically it can be related to epistemology. Why we can identify (by seeing) whether something is changing its position or changing in any way without loosing our target (something itself)? It's because we perceive difference through the minimum necessity that can be provided by eyes to identify a changing of something, so we can identify the sameness of the two things, whenever it's changing. 

Perfection is actualization at the full extent gradually. Perfection is not specifically focus on just one of possibilities. But perfection implements all possibilities gradually with no one left behind. Relatively, when someone has ability to use for both of eyes, in this case, someone is perfect in using eyes, because the two eyes can be activated to see images, but if we ask for how good for both of our eyes capturing images? The answer may lead to the fact that our eyes may not full functional as it should be compared to others. To make a better understanding that most of people misunderstood, about God is perfect. Perfect God means, God should be able to implement God's possibilities as realities, (whether we consider it as good or bad, but since those are part of God's abilities, it should be realized, because God is perfect). Perfect is not related to specific ability of all possibilities that could be realized, but precisely asserts that all possibilities that could be realized, must be able to be realized. Perfection is conceivable gradually within all available functions (with no one left behind) of something. 

What is questioned? Questioning is where ourselves, must be considered within process, becoming something (agree or fit to the specific answer, solution or something may be considered fully understood to the specific extent rather than previously). If our question was answered, at that point ourselves (whether through perception, imagining or any possible means) were at the state where something (the answer) are fit into our logical thinking (personally), or fit into any possible pattern personally. It's like trying to meditate (meditating), it's the same as questioning (in process becoming something). And when we are at the specific extent of meditation level, we may be conditioned to something we consider as progress (an answer) to the specific extent (if we have progress - answer). Back to the question: "what is wrong with this question?" may be understood as "what is wrong with this progress (this process, this direction) of something?" and similar to this. And the answer is, "if the question is answered which maybe considered there is progress or direction to the specific extent", then there is nothing wrong with this question, in fact what we are facing is the answer". But if the progress of something is not running smoothly because there is an obstacle, then the answer is "there is an obstacle answering something, which may not be fixed, may not be shaped, or may not be done to the specific extent whatever it is as requested by the question. What is wrong with this question? 

Incompleteness Theorem Incomplete because there is a kind of proposition that left behind to be proved. I don't understand fully about how Godel made argumentation with his Godel's number and more, but i tried to understand the essence of what did Godel mean by incompleteness theorem. Through my simple understanding about Godel's incompleteness theorem, i tried to deepening further to see a clear distinction and put it in appropriate places. Kurt Godel Logical Framework Suppose there is a programming system that has ability to prove any proposition, therefore: 

Since we were born until now, we are living in this material world, mostly. It makes us very intense to the world (physical state). And when someone said that where we live is nothing, naturally it will make us aware there will be great loss on our life. It will make people realize there is something wrong in our life. But actually, there is nothing to be worry about. Because as already asserted in this question, that we still exist. We still have consciousness. We can dream. Everything is okay. Why should we bother? We shouldn't. But we must concern on different direction. Those are:
