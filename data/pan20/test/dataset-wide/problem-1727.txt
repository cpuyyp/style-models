Can you correlate any change in the MST file to any specific registry setting? I believe the adobe customization wizard will show you where the changes you make will be shown in the registry. If not, you should be able to find this pretty easily in the administrative guide. I would add this registry key to the deployment detection methods and force the clients to re-evaulate. Otherwise, 

I would investigate the logs of both Windows Update and of the logs of .NET 3.5 installer. in order to get a clearer picture of the issue. If .NET is determined to be the issue, I would recommend reviewing the information in this treasure trove of .NET troubleshooting information. 

There is an azure-quickstart-template named 201-vmss-windows-customimage that will give you a template to accomplish this. From the readme.md 

I would check the language setting on the ADR and make sure only the required lanugages are selected. 

This configuration looks correct, provided your Puppet agent is running on a host in the 192.168.1.x subnet. The deny is coming from , since your is allowing all the resources. It would seem that your puppet agent is not connecting form an IP in this range -- try adding to the [files] section temporarily to confirm this. If your puppet agent host is multihomed, check which interface it is sending from. Also check the permissions and ownership on the fileserver.conf is correct. 

Then, completely remove the definition from Thunderbird, and recreate it. Thunderbird will re-probe the IMAP, and will autosubscribe to the folders. 

This assumes your DS to be names of course, and is not as efficient as doing a when you already have the required RRA. 

Check your definition. You almost certainly do not have the autosubscribe option set, or else you added it later after Thunderbird had already probed the server. Make sure you have the option set on the relevant folders: 

Currently we have set up a test VDI environment that hosts several Windows 7 client computers. We are using the "Personal" desktop option and everything seems to be running fine except... The only way to access the virtual desktops seems to be from either logging into the Remote Desktop Web server that is hosting the file and then opening that .RDP file or Alternatively saving that .RDP file and opening it from another PC. We have several Linux based HP t5145 thin clients running "Thin Pro" that we were looking to utilize to connect to these VDIs, but I cannot seem to find a way to open the .rdp file or to connect to the VDI through the pool. The only DIRECT message from Microsoft I could find was here: 

Regarding your question of how can I force users not to install any monthly updates - You can use the following group policy to disallow the removal of updates for both admin / non-admin users. You can hide the "View Installed Updates" page with group policy as well. Regrading your second question of how can I force updates to re-apply if they are removed by users. You need to configure or be aware of the following moving pieces. 

You should migrate your mail using the utility from Dovecot. This will preserve the UIDs and even POP3 UIDLs if necessary. Run using the option, to 'reverse backup' from the remote IMAP server to the local Dovecot server. You need to have a special configuration file created, something like this: 

The command only retrieves data from the raw RRA; if you do not have an RRA of the requested granularity, then the nearest available will be used, but no additional calculations will be performed. Add a new RRA to your RRD file when you create your RRD file, with a 1cdp==5pdp rule. EG 

When you change any custom ruby code, such as a custom function, you must restart the Puppetmaster. If you are running puppet under passenger, this means restarting Apache. Otherwise, you'll get the old version. In addition, there is a rather nasty bug that kicks in if you are hosting multiple environments in your puppetmaster with an identically named function in the other environment. In this case, you have no way to be sure which environment's function is used when you call the function name! It uses the same function namespace across all environments... (this is confirmed to happen in Puppet 2.7.22, not sure about 3.x) 

Open the crash dump / minidump. Click on the blue link that says "!analyze -v" to get more information about the events leading up to the crash. 

Bluescreen view only gives you a high level overview. In order to get in depth you will need to analyze the crash dump using Windows Debugging tools. Analyzing a crash dump seems difficult, however it's pretty simple. This Technet article goes in depth, but it's really a 4 step process. 

So is connecting to client VDI only supported from that darn RDP file? Is there anyway to open that file with rdesktop or another linux alternative? Is there any documentation from Microsoft or HP on the matter? (I couldn't find anything but this sales document that assured me that it was "Fully Tested, Ready to Run") Thanks. 

I am trying to collect azure diagnostics data from some resources in Azure on one separate subscription and directory, and ship them to an OMS / log analytics workspace on another subscription / directory. The account i'm using has access to both organizations, however when I am running the commands to "To enable sending of Diagnostic Logs to a Log Analytics workspace" (as described here) 

RRDTool (as of version 1.4) does not allow you to have different scales on the Y-axis above and below. What it does allow you to do is to create a secondary Y-axis with a scale shift argument. Items are still plotted according to the primary Y axis, though, so you need to perform any necessary calculations yourself. The necessary parameter is --right-axis. $URL$ 

If you have the $, then you can get the Shield software for Elasticsearch. This will allow you to use PKI certificates for authentication and authorisation to the ES cluster. Combined with iptables to restrict access, this should be everything you need. If you're trying to do it for free, then use Apache as a reverse proxy in front of ES to place SSL over the top with some sort of authentication - either Basic user/password, or Certificate-based if you want to be really secure. Again, iptables can block direct access to ES from outside and you can use the Apache access rules or iptables to block unauthorised IPs. 

Your computer is most likely set to use a DNS server of your router / modem and that most likely points to a public ISP such as Comcast, 75.75.75.75 or Google, 8.8.8.8, when you try to resolve $URL$ with your web browser your DNS client is performing a lookup because it does not know about that hostname. (although you can probably resolve the IP using ARP) You can manually edit your host file as specified, or setup a DNS server to resolve that primary zone. 

It sounds like you chose to download / deploy all of the updates in the history of defender. I would verify the ADR definition only is releasing updates released or revised in the last day. There is no reason to download them all. 

Download the Windows Debugging tools from the wizard only instal the WinDbg tool. Launch the tool and configure the symbol path to use 

Now, the filesystem reports a usage of approx 110GB, but the zramfs device reports 165GB. At the same time, the zramfs memory is exhausted, and the filesystem becomes read-only. The zram figures confirm that we are getting a 2.2 : 1 compression ratio between orig_data_size and compr_data_size; however, why does the filesystem show much more free space than the zram device? Even if this is space already allocated for re-use by the filesystem, shouldn't it be reused rather than allocating new space? The data consists of a large number of small files which are added and removed at irregular intervals. 

Note this is for a single user; you may want to have different options if you use a master user/password, or if you require SSL for the connections. Then call it with something like: 

The list is most likely configured to not allow self-unsubscription. This is why you cannot unsubscribe by email. The list of users is held in the database, and so - if you are unable to use the web interface to manage the subscribers - you would need to delete the appropriate record from the subscriber_table. If this list uses an external datasource for the users, then you may need to instead add the user to the exclusion_table as otherwise they will be re-added on the next synchronisation. Having said all of that, you are using a very old (4.x) version of Sympa, and it may predate some of this advice which is based from knowledge of 5.x and 6.x. 

2) Are the integration services up to date on the guest VMs? Try to install the integration services, if it is out of date you will be prompted to upgrade. 3) Have you reviewed the Windows backup logs to determine why this is occuring? The default log location is %windir%\logs\windowsserverbackup - additonal logs are outlined in this Technet post. 

Assuming that you are trying to use the "child VM mechanism", have you made sure you meet the critera outlined? 

If all of those critera are met, I would review the the following: 1) Are the VSS providers / writers in a healthy state on both the host and the guest VMs? This article from Veritas will show you how to check. It's essentially these two commands. 

You think it's originating from your PC? Have you tried unplugging your Ethernet cord and seeing if it fixes the network wide issue? I think you may be taking a too narrow view on a network wide issue by only looking at individual Wireshark logs, have you tried reviewing your switch and router logs and seeing if there are any errors? To find the source of SMB traffic that is suspected to cause the issue I would run a and look for what program is using TCP port 445 (Wikipedia also says UDP ports 137, 138 & TCP ports 137, 139) I would do this on both your workstation and on the file server. I would also set up some network related performance monitors on the file server to see if that is spiking during this time as well. I don't think it would be safe to settle on SMB just yet without seeing the same sort of traffic on multiple workstations. The fact that it is happening at a specific time makes it seem like there is a scheduled task , program, or backup running at that time. WSUS settings and Windows Update GPOs have caused this issue for me in the past, I would double-check those. It really sounds like the best solution would be to set up some sort of SNMP monitoring / NMS on all of the workstations / servers and their NICs. Quest Foglight and Solarwinds NPM, can do this. After monitoring SNMP traffic you would be able to see what interfaces are having high utilization during those trouble times. Buyer beware, this can be expensive. Quest Foglight will let you monitor up to 200 interfaces, so that may be enough for a good sample. 

to the Apache configuration (default for this setting is 131072). I have not been able to verify this fixes the issue but there is anecdotal evidence to indicate that it does. 

You can read the disk queue on a Windows server by using the or agents. These agents are intended for use with Nagios; however they can also be queried by MRTG. You can use the plugin for MRTG that is distributed with the Routers2 frontend. This queries using the NSClient protocol and can access any of the Windows PerfMon counters, which includes the value you require. The plugin has a compilable C version and a native Perl version; the C version is better if you can compile it. To define a MRTG Target using this, have a definition of the form: 

I think that, for some reason, your Sympa installation thinks the hostname is now whereas previously it was . As a result, emails coming in to are passing through the alias file only to be rejected as having an invalid domain. In your , explicitly set the host domain:
