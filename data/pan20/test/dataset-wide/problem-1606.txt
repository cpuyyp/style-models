It's also not clear if things would have been different if the family hadn't decided on organ donation. But it does make sense that they might be less inclined to pull her back from the brink of death considering it was an attempted suicide. (she succeeded a couple years later) Caveats I imagine it's in the vested interest of an organ donation non-profit to paint things better than they are. This answer is focused on the US. Conclusion Organs are only harvested from donors after the decision has been made that the patient has no chance of survival. Mistaken assessments are made, but this doesn't mean the plug wouldn't be pulled anyway. 

On the other side of the coin As this news article points out, mistakes happen. $URL$ After looking through the linked report, it seems the article might be a bit sensational in claiming 

There seems to be reasons for and against the use of N2O (though the study seems somewhat supportive). Either way, it's not exactly a no-brainer. Laughing Gas For Labor Pain — Why Not? 

More recent examples confirming the correlation: (these are the first four results I got on scholar.google.com key words: [sodium intake hypertension] 2011 or more recent. The fifth result was specific to Chinese adults so I stopped there.) (2012) 

Further note that by Palestinians they are referring to current residents of "Judea and Samaria, and the Gaza Strip", except for the Israeli settlements in these regions. I think the "no rights" part was just hyperbole (as is much of the rest of the claim's context as DVK notes in his answer). But, it does seem to be the case that they will not be granted permanent residency or citizenship based on the marriage. BBC : UN blasts Israeli marriage law 

As the page you linked : The Frequency of Striking Conjunctions of Venus and Jupiter goes into, the significance is due to how closely they pass. Well, we can do one better, necessarily if they occult, then they must, at some point been the same as this one (and even better). So when was the last Venus-Jupiter Occultation? Planet-on-Planet Occultations (Worldwide) 

It turns out there are two underlying correlations. First myopic parents typically have myopic children. Second, myopic parents are more likely to use night time lighting for their children. Vision: Myopia and ambient night-time lighting 

So on the fourth day God made two great lights (a single star and a.. moon?) and a lesser light (~10^29 "greater light"s). We are firmly still in the first 8 billion years here. Note that stars are still being born and dying but the first stars will be in the first billion years. Star formation is actually quite beautiful, even if there are some artificial colors in there. Note that some elements like gold, can only be produced in the death of a star. So stars were born and died before our planet ever formed. So there is that pesky earth... 

The results seem to suggest probably not. Though, according to one paper, topical arnica seemed to perform almost as well as 5% vitamin K cream. I include four papers I was able to find testing arnica on bruising. Two of which are homeopathic arnica, the other two are topical arnica. Homeopathic arnica for prevention of pain and bruising: randomized placebo-controlled trial in hand surgery (full text linked) Abstract: (emphasis mine) 

Yes and No, respectively TLDR: Venus and Jupiter passed in front of one and other in 2 bc and have since done so, but will not do so again until 2065. Let's get a couple definitions out of the way... Conjunction 

The first obvious problem is there is the earth. So actually light did exist before the stars. It seems the first photons formed after about 1 micro second. God's a fast talker. But that pesky earth... But there is what's called the photon epoch which lasts from about 10 seconds after the big bang until about 380,000 years. Matter like hydrogen, helium and some lithium was created in this time but no stars yet. 

I would expect there to be several factors including the state of the parents, such as health of child and income.... 

This study was particularly focused on diastolic, so here are a couple that are concerned with systolic as well. $URL$ $URL$ In conclusion, hypertensive and normotensive (all) people who cut back on their sodium(salt) intake should experience a lower (and thereby safer) blood pressure. 

Ok the Bible isn't interested in the origin of life, that stuff's boring. So skipping forward a few billion years of microscopic life and ignoring the birds for now, we'll come back to them, we find those watery swarms. Animal life seems to have arose around 575 million years ago(pdf) and indeed it was in the ocean. But things really got kickin' about 30 million years later in the Cambrian radiation (a period of about 20 million years where rapid diversification of animal life took place).

There seems to be a range of factors contributing to why N2O is not readily available in the US. Nitrous Oxide for Labor Analgesia: Expanding Analgesic Options for Women in the United States 

A little more math: 43% of 366,600 = 157,638 US home fires caused by cooking equipment 48% of 730 = 350 US home fires caused by computers (see above) 350/157,638 = 1 : 450 You are 450 times as likely to have a (reported) US home fire from cooking equipment than a computer. Maybe you could just eat out one more day per year instead of cooking, this should satisfy your safety conscious room-mates by mitigating the added risk of an extra computer. 

According to the study, yes. Three times more women gave their phone number to the man when he was accompanied by a friendly dog. As Oddthinking worked out, it was one of the studies Domestic Dogs as Facilitator in Social Interaction: An Evaluation of Helping and Courtship Behaviors

[note that the following is a brief simplification and overview of life since the Cambrian radiation to give you a feel for it. It's not as well cited just linked up to Wikipedia. It's uncontroversial so I hope there's no problem]. Some more extinction events bring us to the Silurian. In the Silurian we get diversification of jawed and bony fish and the first terrestrial animals, some arthropods. And then the Devonian where we get land plants and further diversified fish. Another extinction event, then the Carboniferous brings us amphibians. Then after an extinction event we get the Permian where we have the mammals and reptiles, this is capped off with the earth's largest extinction event finally killing off the trilobites. Then we find ourselves in the Triassic where we see the first seeds, corals, and a lot of different (what we might recognize as) dinosaurs. Another extinction event and we are in the well known Jurassic where you get the (true) dinosaurs. In a lovely turn of events no major extinction event happens and we are brought into the Cretaceous, finally it starts looking a bit more like home with the first flowering plants, recognizable insects like butterflies. Then we have probably the most well known extinction event and it brings us to the Paleogene where mammals and birds diversify and we see the first grass. Again, not characterized by a major extinction event we find our selves in the Neogene, birds and mammals continue to diversify and we see the first hominids. This is followed by the Quaternary period which takes us through the last 2.6 million years of the earth's history and of course the development of humans and the domestication of cattle. 

Here's another news article about the study that's a bit more informative. Note though I'm not sure where they got the info on the comparison to other major life events. It's not in that study. 

So, is this just for hypertensive individuals or everyone? In another study "Effects on blood pressure of reduced dietary sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet" $URL$ 

Of course it could be argued that the reason the equipment isn't available is because there is no demand. And the reason there is no demand is because hospitals don't want to buy new equipment that will reduce their profits. So let's keep going. Are there other reasons why an epidural may be preferable?

Do nightlights during childhood cause myopia later in life? No, probably not. This was actually pretty interesting, it's like a go to example of confounding. So it was originally found that the amount of light correlated with myopia. Myopia and ambient lighting at night (pdf) 

So a little calculation: 48% of 730 + 36% of 630 = 350 + 227 = 577 computer fires per year. [Note that this category is a bit confusingly worded, I'm not sure what constitutes "office equipment" but I couldn't find computers in any other category, so they may all be accounted for in this one.] So computers seem to catch fire on average about once every 15 hours in the US.

I like the other answers, but I like the question so I wanted to give a more complete and thorough answer. I'd have to say, though I much prefer religious folk contorting their holy books to match science rather than trying to contort science to match their holy books. So firstly, as Oddthinking points out in his answer, the age of the universe is not some 15 3/4 billion years old. Rather about (13.798±0.037)×10^9 years (as calculated with data measured in 2013 by Planck (space observatory). As I understand it there is a high degree of concordance on this and this number is not likely to be off by much. Now this would actually be impressive if it wasn't so obviously post hoc. Which makes it kind of funny that's it's as far off as it is, even with such a contrived explanation, they couldn't have gotten closer? But my spine needs some chilling so let's take a closer look... Day 1 (note this is RSV) 

There would have been some Hydrogen and Helium in the earth from the start, this doesn't tend to stick around. But, as the earth cooled our atmosphere would have formed (day 2) then clouds would have formed and rained down on the earth forming the oceans(day 1). This seems to have been about 4.4 billion years ago(pdf). 

Yes, The relationship between sodium intake and hypertension is extremely well studied. Does sodium intake affect hypertension? Double-blind study of three sodium intakes and long-term effects of sodium restriction in essential hypertension. $URL$ 

The article directly links the papers abstract which in turn links the full paper. Both of which are always really nice. What population does it apply to? 

You can see the proportion of individuals committing the conjunction fallacy above this can be multiplied by 26 (the number of individuals in each group, 27 in atheist) to get the approximate number of individuals committing the fallacy in each group. The pool the students were drawn from was a bit interesting as well. 

TLDR It doesn't seem to be the case that organ donars would be intentionally harvested when they could have lived. This fact sheet by Southwest Transplant Alliance explains... $URL$ DCD (Donation After Cardiac Death) 

Day ? (I have no idea what day to call this, it's all over the place.) So the next thing that happens is the formation of our star(day 4). This would have happened about 9 billions years after the big bang or about 4.6 billion years ago. A protoplanetary disk would have formed around the new sun which much of would collapse into planets (planets like Venus would probably be day 4, considered stars). The earth would have formed from this (day 1). There is various hypotheses about the origin of the moon but I believe the most accepted hypothesis right now states that a planet, Theia smashed into the proto-earth. The collision ejected the earth's crust into orbit, some of which consolidated into the moon(day 4).
