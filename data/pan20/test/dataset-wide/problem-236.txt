Of course, EVERYONE(*) knows it's a pathetically loser thing to revel in tormenting LESSER races. ANYONE can do that. *) you know too, right, aliens? Of course you do, you're just keeping it up to see your peers embarrass themselves. And they're so into it! Like getting publicly excited about a pencil eraser fetish! 

Not really an answer, more a set of loose thoughts fit only for a production with no budget for an evolutionary biologist. In short: all humans are slightly different from us, here. Evolution: epigenetics? Homo sapiens lupus having the potential, but never manifesting it under normal circumstances? Let us not assume complete transformation into exactly a wolf or hybrid. Instead - aside from very plausible behavioral changes and body hair growth - something approximating it. Maybe even wider joints allowing a greater range of articulation, or sliding further down the length for instance, making the joint both look and act different. More likely, though, that it would not be a change, rather, a "direction" one could grow in. Also bear in mind that the existence of such creatures might also alter wolves - if you were born in those circumstances - your point of reference for a comparison would be different. Now... why? Mimicry? temporary environment-triggered "paradigm shift" (lifestyle, energy allocation)? Blending into, or taking control of (easier when you're bigger than them) very widespread wolf packs? I am not qualified to answer beyond claiming it does not so far feel very implausible compared to some other extant phenomena. Moon triggered: Might be same as with wolves howling at the moon - a mistaken myth. Or might be that the time is seen as optimal for hunting in that form - Homo sapiens lupus having inferior low-light vision to Canis lupus and other competing predators. Or syncing with some prey animals. Again, I can't speak much of plausibility. Bite: pathogen or hormone, to trigger the dormant abilities, maybe actually only accidentally activating, or hijacking, the "normal" process for a more extreme effect, like with cannabinoid receptors in the brain - those weren't put there specifically for pot. Whatever it is, it need not wholly take away the ability to sometimes look and act like a "normal" human, but the "similar, but more so" effect could give the affected "werewolves" a specialized advantage, leaving, in the end, only them, and a society of "pure" humans, never manifesting any of these traits... until directly exposed to the former, restoring the victim's lost ability to shift , and possibly permanently changing their instincts. 

The Keepers had MISSED something that had already become too ingrained to control with surgical removals. Their understanding of our nature no better than ours, they have only recently identified it as a phenomenon to keep an eye out for, and only now come to realize it is too late to control it. Like a symptomless disease that presents a danger they cannot allow. Or a psychological quality. Their "pruning" activities are of course limited: life is valuable, mass "accidents" are implausible, and the Keepers often give the benefit of doubt - humans are, after all, weak, easily manipulated, and all too rarely does their environment leave the opportunity to have have strong, properly developed moral beliefs. When such beliefs DO exist, though, it is an abomination in the Keepers' eyes for a subject to shove them aside for no apparent reason. And then along comes Stanley Milgram and shows 65% of people will torture a man to death just because they're repeatedly asked to in a calm voice. No, this cannot be. How can they! How could WE have missed it!? We can salvage this. We'll work harder, and overcome the... ...the INSURMOUNTABLE difficulty of developing and spreading an evolutionary DISADVANTAGE, with what? A Death Note? Bring out the backups. 

(I'm assuming you mean getting a significant fraction of Humanity to accept it, rather than getting volunteers at the unveiling) Create opportunities to get rich, get land and/or power. Send pioneers where there are resources to exploit. Make teleportation cheap enough (for people, at least - not cargo; credit is a good option, too) that moving away will become a viable economical option for people with financial problems. There are many enough of those. Even manual laborers among those who teleport could be seen as more successful than the richest of those who cower in fear of it, rotting away on Old Earth. It's a natural process that's already been shown to work, no need to come up with elaborate schemes to prove it's fine. Definitions of death and self will get changed without much effort on your part, to suit the new circumstances - people hang onto beliefs that make the feel good, not subhuman. What you DO need, is the ability to make the tech available to everyone without getting it subjected to bans and regulations by the extant powers, political, religious, etc. Maybe start your own, or hijack Happyology. It does not matter if 90% of the population become convinced you're peddling Lucifer's doggy doors. They get left behind in the race and cease to matter, realization of their own irrelevance causing them to pretty much self-destruct, and/or pursue you with murderous intent. Through teleporters, of course. 

Are you able to build better contact weapons than point defences, on the same budget? If so, there's your answer. If you have any kind of shield, all you need is the ability to momentarily form it (or something else) into a piercing form at a point of your choosing (ram tip) more easily than you can focus it defensively at a point of the ramming enemy's choosing (flank, etc). I'd say that's very likely, just need to survive it. Also, shields might be unable to deflect slower-moving objects, and to cause damage, momentum is still needed. I have no knowledge of the topic, but assume that reactive armour isn't very good if the projectile has the momentum of a ship behind it. A different approach: boarding. The exterior isn't the target. The inside is. Get a friendly force inside to sabotage... and to claim. Yet another: the ramming ship essentially carries a large boulder in front of it, as shielding / camouflage / weapon. Wanna play chicken? If effective enough, a culture could rise from that, making improvements which replace the rock with something better. 

Wondering how to use your Small Soldiers? I'd focus on sabotage, espionage, and causing paranoia. Directly damaging weapons don't fit their size - at best, a single-shot thing, but even as a smart bomb they wouldn't use their potential best that way. They could overthrow governments using stuff that is forbidden by various conventions. Of more PR-friendly gear, can't go wrong with melee. 

This is something of a combination of Scott and Mirror318's answers: Add a clause to the legend that the sword is super awesome AND can be instantly brought back to a state of full repair (actually replaced) when brought to Merlin or an approved temple or whatever. With a warning of "tempting fate" or something comparable ominous, if this is abused. And the "sword in stone" is a tough, thick ingot meant to be "restored" shortly after, and made/enchanted specifically for the purpose of withstanding the elements and human ingenuity. And don't underestimate that last part. Think of someone bringing siege engine - class machines to dust the rock and replace the Gordian Knot legend. 

Any of those spells alone could win the battle if strong enough, so we must assume reasonable limits. Typical rumored limitations on telekinesis limit its effectiveness to: 

An exotic option that, as far as I can tell, evades many of the mentioned creative workarounds the other answers have: If you're willing to go the way of vibranium (Captain America's shield, absorbs kinetic energy), have a material with unusual inertial properties, like a solid-state equivalent of a spinning flywheel. Perhaps possessing huge inertia regardless of mass, possibly manifesting at greater intensity the greater the attempted speed of change. Superb protection against high-velocity impacts. Mediocre protection against melee-speed weapons. Movement impediment, possibly "tunable" to a small degree, letting you find your preferred balance of low-velocity protection and freedom of movement. The "indestructability" part could come in a related flavor, letting the material be workable at low speeds, but otherwise resisting with a force roughly proportional to the mass of the piece (thus affecting design, and maybe still leaving steel superior for small pieces, justifying vulnerabilities and similarities to our world). It would, at best, make a functional mace, though the property trade-off may still make it less practical than many alternatives. Not impossible, just an inferior idea. As projectiles, I suppose they could be used in a long rifle if you held it steady long enough, though maybe not much better than a sling. What if you wanted to use them as tiny bullets packing a huge punch? I suppose small mass, air drag, and a need to put together a larger piece of the material to make use of the properties, could take care of that. Or low temperature tolerance. This could make for a separate SE question. Rods from God, though? Goodbye, continents.
