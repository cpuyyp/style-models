I understand the concept of how all observations are theory laden and how it works as a critique of the positivist program. From this link: 

From this point of view, recreating "sub-human" hominids is on par with cloning sheep or cloning frogs, and presumably there is nothing wrong with it, unless you object to cloning in general. An opposing view was presented by Douglas Hofstadter, in his book "I am a strange loop", ("I am a strange loop", Chapter 1, "On souls and their sizes"). Hofstadter disagrees with your second assumption (B), and believes that most highly evolved animals, including all mammals have enough consciousness that they should be treated ethically. He doesn't see self-awareness as a on-off thing that a being has or doesn't have. Instead, he argues that there is a continuous scale of consciousness, with plants on end having none at all, insects having very little, and gradually increases until we get to full fledged adult human consciousness. Under his hierarchy of "Soul sizes", most animals have enough consciousness that they are self-aware and should be treated ethically (He himself became a vegetarian based on these considerations). Based on Hofstadter's considerations, either you can recreate such homonids, but on the condition of treating them ethically, and presumably according a minimum number of rights, or if you are not willing/able to do that, refrain from recreating them. 

So Schrodinger ideas, and their subsequent confirmation by Watson and Crick, seem to support the Kantian approach to life as organization, but more importantly, has become one of the main arguments in favor of reductionism and even materialism, in the sense that it showed that something as complex as life might be eventually explained in terms of basic physics, and giving strong arguments against dualist and vitalist conceptions of life and of mind. 

A semi-serious question: (a) Excluding the rare cases of atheists who are also dualists, most atheists are materialists who don't believe in souls. (b) Many such atheists are also moral/ethical people, in fact they are usually adamant that atheism doesn't imply immorality - they don't need a deity to force them to behave, etc....therefore a moral atheist would consider it immoral to take an innocent life. Now given (a), from an atheist point of view, there's nothing that privileges human life over other forms of life. A theist might be able to claim, like Descartes did, that only humans have souls, or some other such human-centric worldview. An atheist on the other hand, has no such grounds for privileging humans over other living beings. The difference between Einstein and an amoeba is merely one of degree, not kind. So if an atheist holds that (a) there are no souls, and (b) killing is bad - then the only logical course of action for her is to be vegetarian. She can eat plant products, because eating plant products doesn't necessarily require killing the entire plant. But if she is to respect the value of life, she cannot eat any meat since killing a living creature would be unavoidable. The only other conceivable option is for atheists to become carrion eaters. Is this reasoning valid? If one claims to be both a materialist atheist and a moral person, then the only choices they have are being vegetarian or eating carrion? 

For dualists, mind substance is supposed to be fundamentally different from matter in a number of ways. Two of them: 

First a point of clarification, from what you are describing, you are talking about libertarian freewill, not compatibilist freewill. More on that later. At the heart of your question is a confusion that you need to clarify, then you will understand the second paragraph you quoted better. You are confusing "Determinism" with "Lack of freewill" due to a logical fallacy. The two concepts are related, but they are not the same. Specifically, the following relationship holds: 

The short answer: You simply can't argue with such a person. If you can't agree on a basic set of premises, then no meaningful argumentation is possible. Consider the following discussion: A: "The theory of evolution is supported by the fossil record, carbon dating and geological considerations" - B: "Satan planted all that evidence to lead the faithful astray and hide the real truth that the world was created in 6 days by God, sometime around 6000 BC." A & B will never agree on anything. This is a radical example of the fact that everything is theory laden. The only way to convince such a person would be to prove that another part of their argument is based on the same data. For example, they might site government statistics that minorities are at a disadvantage in the job market or in college admissions compared to whites, at which point you could challenge them on why are government statistics acceptable in some parts of the discussion but not in other parts. You could force them to be consistent in there source of facts. But if they don't have any such inconsistencies, then it is indeed impossible to convince them otherwise. 

(2) and (3) are why I mentioned above in my initial answer that "Using approximations or meta-heuristics to calculate probable values would be dangerous." 

Intuitively, there is a clear difference between knowing something and understanding something. We speak of someone 'getting' or 'internalizing' a concept, of developing a 'gut feeling' for something, etc... Some examples: 

Wittgenstein proposed in his later philosophy the concept of family resemblance to describe groups which cannot be defined by a single (or simple set) of common features but instead display (from the SEP): 

And all sorts of similar situations were one could argue that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Situations which I call "ethical totalitarianism" (if there is a more accurate term please correct me). My question is, how do utilitarians avoid justifying such scenarios? Or would a utilitarian say that these scenarios are indeed justified? 

Setting aside the issue of fairness, it is in the billionaire's interest that the general public is healthy, well educated, and feeling secure about their livelihoods and families. If the working class finds itself struggling and out of money, they will not be able to purchase the goods that the billionaire produces, leading to periodic economic crises. This is known as the boom-bust cycle. Seen from a point of view of fairness and justice, there are people who cannot contribute to the well being of society through no fault of their own: orphans, the disabled, etc...somebody has to take care of those people, and it is only fair that those who were luckiest in life (the billionaires) shoulder the most responsibility in taking care of those who the least lucky. John Rawls adresses these questions broadly in his theory of Justice as Fairness. He discussed these ideas in his book "A Theory of Justice", but I will quote the SEP article on John Rawls: 

My question is the following: Is this indeed the case, that denying the possibility of strong AI implies substance dualism? 

An initial note: To claim that science is "better" than religion implies that science is trying to answer the same questions as religion. Many would argue that that is not the case. See Stephen Gould's Non-overlapping magisteria or Karen Armstrong's distinction between Logos and Mythos. 

What you are touching upon here is the issue of scientific realism vs scientific anti-realism (See here and here). We frequently resort to unobservable entities to explain our best scientific theories (gravity, electrons, genes, etc...). What is the status of such entities? Are they real objects in the same way that rocks, cheeseburgers and trees are? or are they conceptual tools similar in status to a Fourier Transform or to the Matrix representation of a process? 

Substance dualism is the belief that the mind and the body (especially the brain) are ontologically separate: they are made of different substances, and possibly they occupy different realms all together (See Platonism). I don't have a better reference for you, but in this lecture, John Searle mentions the fact that substance dualism was a later addition to Christianity, and early Christians believed only in bodily resurrection. God is all powerful and doesn't need two substances, he can resurrect people in the afterlife even if they are only constituted of material substance. The idea that physicalism and the monotheistic religions are contradictory is relatively recent. See here and here as well for discussions. Moreover several Christian thinkers were Aristoteleans, so they presumably believed in body-soul hylomorphism, i.e. the soul as form, not as independent substance. That being said many dualists are primarily motivated by their religious beliefs. Islamic scripture, on the other hand, mentions explicitly that God created people from clay and then blew souls into them. Presumably this is unambiguous substance dualism. From the Quran: 

Are these true causal relationships? Or is it merely us projecting our temporal thought processes onto the ideas and propositions we are analyzing and hence seeing causality where there is none? Can relations of ideas have causal relationships? 

What would the implications of such a state of affairs be (i.e. that both dualism is true and strong AI is possible)? 

The dilemma: Are the local authorities (the local sheriff, the village council, whatever...) justified in forcing the old man to hand over his medicine? On one hand it is the only way to save the child, on the other hand this would be an infringement of the rights and freedom of the old man. Most people would argue that yes, the local authorities are justified, but I am interested in the strong Libertarian position. Given how much importance Libertarians like Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand place on personal freedom and choice, and how they consider any form of taxation or government coercion or control of resources to be morally wrong, how would they respond to the dilemma? Are the authorities justified or not in forcing the man to give his medicine to the infant? Alternative scenario: The old man is willing to part with the medicine, but at an exorbitant price (like the entire family's holdings and their income for the next 10 years). Per Nozick, Rand (or Milton Friedman), in this case, are the authorities justified in forcing the old man to sell it for a reasonable price (whatever that is)? 

(*) An additional note: That the logical positivist program is considered to have failed and was abandoned by the 1960s is the most common position, and is frequently mentioned in various introductory articles and courses. As I mentioned earlier, it was notable that several people who were themselves associated with the L.P movement had agreed that it failed, which is why most accept its failure as a fact. Some philosophers, notably Michal Friedman, have argued that Logical Positivism shouldn't be dismissed, that it hasn't failed as completely as most sources claim, and that too many people dismiss it because it became fashionable to do so, without actually examining the ideas of LP. See Reconsidering Logical Positivism and this post. Regardless of whether the L.P program failed completely or not, it's influence on philosophy in general and analytical philosophy in particular cannot be denied. One can argue that although the verification principle itself has challenges, the spirit of L.P with its emphasis on clarity and rigor has been passed on to subsequent schools of thought.
