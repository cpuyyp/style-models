The leaf solution makes the other options more viable too. If you have the time, pack sticks (~1-2in diameter) side-by-side to make a bed, then cover that with leafs to soften it up. This adds extra insulation from the ground. Sometimes it feels nice too, sometimes it doesn't. With the materials you listed, I recommend using the sheet of plastic to gather leafs faster, and make a mattress with more than 2ft of leafs. Lay the sheet on the ground, weigh it down with rocks if needed, then rake leafs onto it with your arms and feet. You can then use the plastic sheet to help separate you from the wet, cold ground. Note that not all leafs are made equal: some evergreen needles would be miserable to sleep on, but the most comfortable bedding I've found in forests happens to be evergreen: white pine needles. If you can gather a bunch of small white-pine branches and stack/weave them to be a mattress (more emphasis on getting 2ft worth than how well put together it is), you will have a very soft bed. If you can add some gear, a wool blanket will go a long way as a mattress or extra insulation in any way whether wet or dry. 

Inspired by the question Where should a person who can't hold a paddle sit in a tandem kayak? "One friend was born without arms" Many life jackets are vests that are in part, kept on the person by the arms extending through arm holes. If worn by a person without arms, it would seem likely the life jacket would easily slip off of the person rather then support them. What kind of Life Jacket for a person without arms? 

So what do you care about? You care about where you are, where you want to be, and what you will need to overcome between the two. A compass is one of your tools, and is subject to local variations which also must be accounted for. Your primary tools is the map, your primary goal is to define your current locations, secondary is to define your desired direction of travel. Putting it all together you orient yourself and the map. Depending on where you are on the globe, a compass may be of no added value (i.e. near either pole). So not is not bad, to never adjust for true north, just be aware of the limitations of all your tools, and make good judgement on based on realistic expectations of the available information. 

Related to flith's answer, noise can be a deterrent. The same way fires are prohibited in some areas, making too much noise may also be frowned upon, so this may not be a viable strategy depending on where you are. Wilderness survival expert Les Stroud carries a harmonica as a personnel item and to provide some comfort. He has noted a thought, as I and others have as well, that the harmonica noise can deter animals (while also providing personal comfort before bed). The saying 'they are more scared of you than you are of them' applies here - animals need to exercise caution as a matter of survival, and approaching a strange creature is risky. Approaching a strange creature that appears very large, fierce, fearless, or making disturbing, loud, piercing sounds (like those from a harmonica) may also appear risky and cause more animals to avoid the area accordingly. 

Motor boats are prohibited (electric only motors, is ok) Manually powered boats are allowed Open to the public most or all of the year Ability to paddle to and from the launch point (There are rivers that come close to my criteria but the current makes the journey one way) 

Not discounting the existing answers which provide great perspectives. You don't really care where the North Pole is. It is not like there is only one or two, nor is like anything is stable. There are half a dozen north poles and most of them move around regularly and they move a lot (10s and 100s even 1,000s of miles/kilometers). 

You can do those three things trekking, just need to adapt the gear/methods for mobility. Here are the same steps, using what's available trekking based on what I and my peers carry: 

Listening to your body is good advise as others said: try to maintain relaxed, deep breathing, and when it becomes too much for you to do comfortable, you should slow down or stop to reset back to that. Relaxed in this case just means without tension or any struggle to breathe and get the air you need - climbing a mountain, breathing will be vigorous, but it can still be calm and under control. Someone else mentioned using a heart rate monitor - though I don't have experience with that, I imagine it can help like awareness of your own breathing. Differing from other answers thus far, I would recommend keeping distance goals based on the overall checkpoints planned on that day. Practicing with simple day hikes and easier backpacking trips certainly makes sense, and even in those cases you will have checkpoints you plan on, whether it's a half way point, a peak, your car, a camp site. In more elaborate trips you will have an understanding of the terrain and natural landmarks to guide you along the trail - practice good orienteering by checking your progress based on terrain, landmark, and trail based checkpoints; consider if your goals are in harmony with your progress or if you need to adjust. As you practice you'll get a feel for how to combine the above two paragraphs for you and even for your group so that you can make the best steady progress. You'll have some times you just stop to cool off and reset, but importantly you will begin to combine progress goals with your body's resting needs. 

Acquire it 6 months or less before your trip on the AT. There is some controversy but it seems you can probably count on immunity from an exposure to last 6+ months. Some of the best places to acquirer Norovirus (that are easily accessible) are daycare centers and nursing homes. Volunteering at one or more of these institutions, is win/win you get to help others, and you get exposure to the nasties before you hit the trail. If you see a cruise ship on the news, you might be able to get to the dock for unloading and acquire it there. Enjoy working through the bout of Norovirus at home, before your trip. 

Working in a very tick infested woods for a summer, I accumulated many tick-bites (before learning the wonders of vinegar solutions for repelling ticks). Most of the tick removals were done at the end of the day in my cabin, where I did my thorough tick-checks. This was recommended to me and worked very well in my experience of over 1 month with 5+ ticks a day: 

In any case, you want to get the tick off ASAP - no need to panic and rush, but do prioritize it so to avoid extra unnecessary hours of risking disease transfer. Doing at least daily checks on yourself when in areas where you may get tick-bites, and removing them promptly, is important to avoid tick-borne illnesses. If out in the field with no swab or liquid soap, you could try similar alternatives (I had mixed success using hand sanitizer and my finger in the field) or go with the more conventional tweezers or tick-key removal methods, taking care to pinch the tick as close to the mouth as possible and remove the entire tick. If bitten, make note of it and keep a careful watch for symptoms - if infected, the sooner you begin treatment the better. 

Yesterday I was out in the woods and had a runny nose. When I wanted to blow my nose I looked for maple leaves, because I knew what they were. Not sure if the list of bad choices is small enough for single answer, but if it is. What kind of leaf should I NOT use for tissue or toilet paper? 

Yes and No. There are challenges: While the trike does sit with all 3 tires on the the bottom of the canoe, it only fits in this one position, facing forward in the front half of the canoe. You can get two people and two bicycles in canoe, but with a trike one person is probably the limit. You can just barely see it in the photo, but the front canoe seat is between the trike saddle and the peddles. While you could sit in the trike saddle there is not a good place to put your feet. The canoe seats are an intricate part of the structure. Removing the canoe seat would require some structure redesign. Assuming you did redesign the canoe structure so the there was a place for your feet. You could definitely sit on it and paddle. I normally travel on the rail trails and rivers near Pittsburgh PA with this combination. Me in the back paddling and the trike sitting in front. That big comfy seat blocking a good part of my view. So I often stand up in the canoe and paddle it like a standing paddle board. Standing is much more top heavy then sitting in the trike saddle would be, so no it would not be to high and top heavy. Yes there would be an increased risk of tipping over. Canoe seats are not equal distances from the ends. The front seat sits closer to the center so there is leg room for a forward facing occupant. This is why the trike only fits in one place. You may notice in the other photos at How to carry a bicycle in a canoe? when I have the bicycle in the canoe, it is in the center and I sit in front seat facing backwards, essentially turning around and driving it backwards. There are multiple considerations for one person in a canoe, a few are outlined in What is the most effective means of paddling a canoe, against the current, under a bridge? The next challenge is steering; unless you are fighting strong winds or currents, the most effective place to paddle is near the back, but far enough forward to keep the bow in the water (varies with load). Paddling the canoe effectively while sitting on the trike in the front of the canoe, would be unpleasant/difficult. The trike would need to be farther back to make paddling and steering more pleasant and effective. The next challenge is getting in and out of the canoe. Unless you are at a dock and/or have assistance, the standard landing/launching with one person is to have the back of the canoe out in the water, with the front on land. You climb in the front walk down the center of the boat and push off after settling your self in the back. With the canoe afloat, it would be very difficult to get to the seat from either end, climbing over or around the seat or handle bars would be difficult in good conditions, a little wind or current and you would definitely get wet. The canoe in the picture is 17 feet long, you could beach sideways (and I have) but it requires a large launch, many of the launch points on the Monongahela and Youghiogheny Rivers are to small for this Don't forget extra flotation, How much flotation does a canoe need? if/when you flip the canoe over, if the trike is strapped in (as it should be) the canoe and the trike will sink together. There are a few other challenges, but overcoming them requires rebuilding the boat so it is not a canoe. a Scanoe might be wide enough in the rear to place the trike far enough back to be functional. By the time you get this working, you would be better off starting out to build a canoe bike 

One of the best things you can do in this situation is actually what you could do before it happens: bring preparations. Other comments have already mentioned different items already and ultimately you need to have brought those with you for them to be of any use, or what you lack in items you need skills to make up for them. Whether by items or skills, you need to be prepared to address a few major goals/needs. I think about this in part with the classical elements, an helpful checklist to consider. 

Cardboard box with a hole in it. Tape the paper over the hole. If your range has a place to mount the cardboard, you only need a single side of the box. If not take the whole box and cut entrance AND exit holes in it. Optimally the arrow should pass all the way through the paper without touching anything but the paper. If you need to elevate the box, just bring more boxes, you can stack them. New moving/storage boxes are available for less than a dollar.
