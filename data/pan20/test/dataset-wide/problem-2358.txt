On reason why the Bison costs less is simply because it has less down. At 8oz for 35$, that's not a big difference though. The bison is warmer because it is more snug. The semi-rect shape of the Cypress loses a lot of heat that way, because it exposes a larger outside area. 

When you start packing lighter, usually it comes with smaller margins of error. It seems that it is typically your case here. Basically, the first thing is to be more careful. It is a habit to take. For example, when you couldn't find information about whether there was deep wet snow or not, the decision of not taking the snowshoes was maybe arguable. Then, when you got to the wet part of your walk, you could have used your gaiters and your over-pants, which would have protected your pants, and a little your shoes. As for which shoes work best, it is a complicated question. Winter shoes are too hot for that weather, and you'll sweat in them. Hiking boots could be too light for the constant contact of frozen water, and possibly not waterproof enough. I don't have a definite answer on this. However, in many places where it snows a lot in winter, the melting period is not a period when you hike much. For one, because the conditions are unstable (it can be very nice, or freezing with snow), and also because the large amount of snow melting all at once creates a very muddy, unstable and fragile ground. Here in Quebec, most parcs are closed for a few weeks during that period, to protect the trails. 

Also, I assume you have a strategy for water. To carry as little water as possible, get as much information as you can on where you can get water, and what is the situation when you are actually reaching that supply. (For example, some springs may be dry in summer or frozen in winter.) Finally, make sure you know yourself. How much food you need, what type of food you can eat for several days in a row, how much more you can walk when you are tired, what is the impact of bad weather on morale and speed,... 

A 1/25000 map gives you roughly 5 km by 7,5. With 4cm overlap between maps, you have 1km overlap, that should be enough. What I did last time was to scan all the maps for the whole trip, join them in one big image, then cut 1-page-sized images from the map, with clear overlap from one to the next. Knowing exactly what path I would follow allowed me to adjust the pages to get the overlap in better places. 

but it can also be a coating applied on the seam. In the easier case where it is tape, see rockywoods instructions on applying it. You'll have to remove the tape, un-sew the existing zipper (be careful not to rip other seams), put the new zipper in place, sew it carefully, tape the seam. Depending on where you live there might be an outdoor gear repair specialist near you who could do that for you. For example, those guys: $URL$ 

Comfort .25" (6.3mm) may make a difference, but that part is very subjective. I find 1.5" (38mm) to be plenty. The shape depends on how you sleep. Conclusion If I had to choose within these 2, I would not hesitate and take the AirRail 1.5. But it is still too heavy for backpacking for me, so I would probably not take it anyway, unless I needed the R-value for cold weather. 

Given the description of the problem, it seems you have to replace the zip entirely. You can bring it to a tailor, they should be able to do most of it. They may not have the waterproof zipper, though, but you can find it online. Measure it first. It is probably a #5 size, though you don't have to use the exact same model. Or you can do it yourself if you have a sewing machine. (If you have never done this, exercise first!). Also, there should be a waterproofing mechanism behind the zipper. Often it is a tape: 

Using a precise topographic map of your hike, re-calibrate your altitude watch whenever possible. (At the start, at a summit, at a crossing,...) 

Pads have several measurable characteristics that may be important for you when you make a decision: 

I would recommend starting by making a list of the gear you'll need, not forgetting anything. (Note separately fuel, water and food as the amount will change, consider if you'll be carrying water or purifying/filtering as you go) That will tell you how much you'll have to carry, what pack you need, what equipment you may not have. If that is significantly more than what you are used to carry, either reduce the weight by changing equipment, or by training beforehand. Typically, do other hikes with the same kind of stuff, on the same kind of terrain. You'll see if some stuff you carry are not needed, if you are missing something... Start with shorter distances (e.g. 30-40km over a week end), carrying the same gear. 

Then, you can consider getting lighter replacements for gears you already have, but that's for another time I think. Finally, even though it has already been mentioned, consider filtering and purifying water. This way, you can a/ carry less water and b/ stop worrying about not having enough water. 

(That's a minimum of 2kg that you can shave with no effort or extra stuff) Now, 14kg is perfectly reasonable, but: 

I waterproof each element that needs it instead of the whole thing: the sleeping bag is in one, the clothes in another, the day clothes possibly in a small pouch. Food is usually wrapped on its own (otherwise, ziplocks), books go in ziplocks, map is either plastified or in a flat transparent thing, the rest does not need water proofing. 

I carry it in my pocket or in the belt of my pack. I never felt the need to have a dedicated holder for it. Now regarding your arguments: 

Not really. The only long-distance communication method phones have is GSM/CDMA-based, and requires a tower (at which point, just call each other). Other signals they carry are usually Bluetooth and WiFi, with an effective range of respectively 10 and maybe 30 meters. 

I find that horizontal is often not convenient. It will get caught in narrow paths, it will get in the way of your arms if you use poles to go up, and it can easily get unbalanced, pulling strongly on one side. On the other hand, most dedicated packs allow you to secure the board vertically, which works very well. You need to secure it very tight to prevent it from swing from side to side, and also you need to adjust the height to make sure it does not get in the way of your legs while walking. The only moment when it can be bothering is when you are facing the wind, because then it pulls from above your head. Regarding the choice of snowshoes, beware that you will be much slower than people with split or skis with you (talking about ~50% faster on skis), and that you would tend to take different (more direct) approaches in steep slopes. (rather than zigzaging a lot like skis do) 

The needle size depends on the size of the thread. With that material, you would possibly use MARA 50 (Tex 60) to get strong seams, but you can also use a Tex 40, which is already plenty strong. I would not recommend a smaller thread. I usually use the following needles for thread size: 

Poles can usually be repaired (to a point), or replaced with equivalent or with similar models with a little work. Better yet is to use a tent that fits on straight poles, which can be replaced with trekking poles, or with standard straight poles. (MSR has some, for example). As for fly and inner, the simpler the easier to mend, and the easier to replace one without the other. Typically, BD sells the Beta Light as 2 separated parts, and several cottages can make custom inner or fly that would fit with those. (And you can even make your own!) 

For the characteristics of the pads you selected, here is what I can say: Weight Crucial when backpacking. 

I'll answer anecdotally. I started lowering the weight of my pack by - weighting stuff I put in, - considering whether I need each item or if it could be replaced, - considering that some cottage or myog could be as or more efficient for less weight The first home-made gear I used was a sleeping quilt. It is good to ~0C comfortably, is synthetic (2 layers of primaloft 133g/m^2 - that's 4oz/sqyd) (because around those temperature you get a lot of cold humidity), weights ~850g, and fits in a 13L bag without effort. Now, for UL, that's still heavy and big. But that's still much better than what I had before, a 1.3kg 5C bulky bag. Also, it is a quilt, which I find way more comfortable (for those temperatures. Below, I would still use a sleeping bag). Several cottages have quilts that, beside being lighter, would be more comfortable that traditional sleeping bag. As for shelters, I find that I prefer tents that use straight poles vs domes (e.g. the MSR twin sisters). I find them easier and quicker to set up, simpler and more reliable. (and also lighter, but that's just a bonus) There are cottages that offer that kind of shelters using various fabrics, in various sizes. Clothing is more tricky, because you want to test them before wearing them. (And making jackets yourself is extremely long, I find.) Packs, finally, come last. I find it a much more complex piece of equipment, and I find anyway that comfort comes first (once the volume is decided, based on the rest of the stuff). Comfort is obviously hard to test without trying the gear. I would probably not consider a cottage pack, unless I could try it from someone. Overall, I would recommend considering cottage gear not solely in a weight reduction perspective, but also because they offer different shape and type of gear. 

I find that whenever I have to perform fine manipulation that require removing my gloves, in those temperatures (even up to -20 or -15), I feel my hand cool down really fast to the point of hurting within a minutes (seconds if there is wind and it is really cold). I don't find it hard to believe that exposed skin can get bad frostbites in 30 minutes. 30 minutes is a long time. The temperature of your face depends on how much warm blood your body sends there, which depends on how warm you are overall. If you stay in the wind for a while, monitor the level of feeling in your nose, have someone watch for discoloration if possible, wear a facemask if you need, and remember that when it stops hurting it is already late. Also remember that the difference between -20 and -35 is the same as between 15 (light jacket on a cool spring day) and 0 (snow, most people wear hats, gloves, and thicker jacket if out for more than 10 minutes)
