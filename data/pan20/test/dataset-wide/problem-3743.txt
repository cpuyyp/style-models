When working with large numbers of graphs, a canonical labelling routine is essential as, after the initial cost of canonically labelling each graph, it permits isomorphism checks to be replaced with identity checks. Currently I am working with large numbers of transitive permutation groups; the degree is small (40ish) but the size of group can be large, and my programs are gumming up due to having to perform large numbers of - not exactly isomorphism - but conjugacy checks. (I need to check each pair of groups to see if they are conjugate in the symmetric group.) This process would be considerably easier if there was a known way of finding a canonical conjugate of the incoming permutation groups... 

There is no smaller example. Various places, including Andries Brouwer's list of parameters and existence for small SRGS ($URL$ show that there are only a handful of parameter sets to check. Those with fewer than 25 vertices can almost be checked by hand as they fall into a few families (Paley graphs) or are well-known individual graphs (e.g Clebsch graph). For the parameter set $(25, 12, 5, 6)$ there are exactly $15$ graphs and they have automorphism groups of orders $1$ (twice), $2$ (four times), $3$ (twice), $6$ (four times), $72$ (twice) and $600$. 

(For example, see Theorem 5.11 of Marker's "Lectures in Infinitary Model Theory".) I would like to have a similar result for $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa^+ \kappa}$ with uncountable $\kappa$ that guarantees the existence of sufficiently large models with $\leq \kappa$-many types. (Indeed, having $\leq \kappa$-many quantifier free 1-types suffices for my purposes.) The problem I am having is that the usual proof of this fact does not generalize to uncountable $\kappa$: The proof proceeds by taking the Skolem hull of a large set of indiscernibles, whose existence is guaranteed by an argument that uses the Erd√∂s-Rado theorem. If one tries to imitate the same proof, in order to guarantee that the Skolem hull is an elementary substructure, one has to introduce Skolem functions of infinite arity, which in turn requires one to consider indiscernibles with respect to formulas possibly having infinitely many variables; and this requires a partition relation where one colors $\geq \omega$-tuples. However, such partition relations are known to fail in general. Is there any way to get around this problem or is it the case that the generalization of this fact fails? If it helps, you may assume that $\kappa$ has various properties such as being strong limit, inaccessible etc. 

Every excellent mathematician that I know works extremely hard and for very long hours; however there are many others who also work extremely hard who are just average or "journeyman" mathematicians. In other words, hard work is necessary but not sufficient - the existence of prodigies such as the Terry Taos and Akshay Venkateshs (just to name two Aussies that I've at least met) seems to me to be sufficient evidence that some natural talent/creativity/imagination/genius is necessary beyond mere hard work. The working habits of mathematicians can also be endlessly amusing - we currently have a visitor who feels that he is full of creative energy immediately on waking, and so rather than getting out of bed and wasting that energy showering and having breakfast etc., he puts in an hour or two of maths and only starts the daily routine when he reaches his first dip in energy. 

Let $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa \lambda}$ denote the infinitary logic that allows conjunction of less than $\kappa$-many formulas and simultaneous quantification of less than $\lambda$-many variables. It is well-known that 

I would like to understand the complexity of "equality of Borel sets". By complexity, I mean the complexity in the sense of Borel reducibility. Of course, since there is no standard Borel space of Borel sets of a Polish space, we have to work with Borel codes to make sense of "equality of Borel sets". Here is a nice paper by Clemens. In Section 1, he explains how we construct the space of Borel codes and what "equality of Borel sets" means (see Definition 8). Let $E_B$ be the equivalence relation on Borel codes defined as follows: Two Borel codes are $E_B$-equivalent if and only if they define the same Borel set. It can be seen that the equivalence relation $E_B$ on the set of Borel codes is not a Borel equivalence relation (for example, see the remarks in Page 5). The set of Borel codes is not even a Borel set. On the other hand, if we fix some $\alpha < \omega_1$, then the set ${BC}_{\alpha}$ of Borel codes of rank less than $\alpha$ is a Borel set. My question is whether or not $E_{\alpha}$, equivalence of Borel codes of rank less than $\alpha$, is Borel? I specifically want to know if this is true when $\alpha$ is finite (more specifically, $\alpha=4$). My first reaction was to carry out an induction argument trying to bound $E_{\alpha}$ from above by using jumps or powers of the previous bounds but I can't seem to figure out what to do. I suspect that these relations might not be Borel even for small finite values. 

The system encouraged me to answer my own question, although it feels a bit strange to do so. Anyway, after a bit of thinking and a (more substantial) bit of computing, I can now safely conclude that this 18-vertex 28-edge graph is the smallest uniquely-hamiltonian graph with minimum degree 3, and there are no others of this order (number of vertices) and size (number of edges). 

Although it is not drawn planar, it is planar, and so it has no $K_5$-minor. However it has lots of $K_4$-minors. For example, the $0,4,6,8$ induces $K_4\backslash e$ and so adding any path from $4$ to $6$, say $4-7-1-6$ gives a graph that can be contracted to $K_4$. So this shows that deleting $2$ or $3$ or $5$ still leaves a $K_4$-minor. The remaining cases are similar and left as an exercise! As for the colouring, it is easy to see that it is not $3$-colourable just by working with the triangles (start with $0$ red, $6$ green and $8$ blue and follow your nose). But contracting any edge leaves a $3$-chromatic graph. You can see this easily enough by hand, or just run this code: 

I am writing this not only as an answer to your question, but also to some questions that were linked in your question. There seems to be a bunch of questions on MO that essentially ask the same thing: "Model theory is using concepts of set theory, set theory is using concepts of model theory. Is set theory, which is claimed to be the foundation of mathematics, based on circular reasoning?" The short answer is no. I believe mathematicians who are not logicians and who confuse themselves with such questions simply want to see how tools in set theory and model theory are "built hierarchically". I am not claiming that all logicians perceive logic the way I am about to describe, but here is an approach: 

How about an infinite (strictly) descending sequence in a well-founded relation? It does not have a special name because it does not exist for trivial reasons. But it fits the description, there are tons of proofs where people construct infinite descending sequences of natural numbers, ordinals etc. 

First it constructs the graph, checks that it is 4-chromatic, runs through each edge and checks that the edge-deleted graph is 3-chromatic. Finally it confirms that there are no hamilton paths - Sage apparently only has an "all paths" command for directed graphs, so I just turn the graph into a digraph where each edge becomes two opposite-directed arcs. 

You are describing what are usually called "weak maps" between matroids. So a bijection $\varphi: E(\mathcal{N}) \to E(\mathcal{M})$ is called a weak map if for every independent set $I$ of $\mathcal{M}$ the inverse image $\varphi^{-1}(I)$ is independent in $\mathcal{N}$. In your case, you are asking when the identity function is a weak map, which just requires every independent set of $\mathcal{M}$ to be independent in $\mathcal{N}$. There is lots of stuff known about weak maps (and strong maps) and other things. Given a bunch of matroids on the same ground set, the weak-map relation is a partial order. The best place to start is around page 280 of the second edition of Oxley's book Matroid Theory, which refers to the original papers. The "minimal" relaxation that can be done is to take a single non-basis $N$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and form a matroid whose bases are ${\mathrm{bases}} (\mathcal{M}) \cup \{N\}$. This will work if (and, I think, only if) $N$ is a circuit-hyperplane of $\mathcal{M}$. So you certainly do not expect all of your relaxations to pass Sage's routine. In fact, I wanted to do a test to convince myself that it was working ok, so I ran the following code, just testing all the relaxations of a single randomly chosen matroid (in this case the matroid called ). All this does is create an array of matroids, each of which are specified by their bases, for which I am using the bases of together with one of the non-bases. Then I ask which of those matroids are valid. 

In some sense, this theorem tells you that you cannot diagonalize "against a Borel equivalence relation" in a "uniform" Borel way. The operation $E \mapsto E^+$ is known as the Friedman-Stanley jump. For any Borel equivalence relation $E$ with more than one equivalence class on a standard Borel space, $E <_B E^+$ where $\leq_B$ denotes the Borel reducibility. Indeed, Friedman's own proof that $^+$ is a jump operator makes use of the Borel diagonalization theorem. As a last remark, I should add that in the above paper Friedman claims that in order to prove this Borel diaganolization theorem in its full form, it is necessary to use $\omega_1$ many iterations of the power set of operation (Corollary 3.4), just like Borel determinacy theorem. Indeed, according to Lemma 3.2.5, there exists a constant $n \in \omega$ such that Borel determinacy up to Borel sets of rank $ \leq \alpha+n$ implies the Borel diagonalization theorem for Borel equivalence relations of rank $\leq \alpha$. 

I tried to construct an example that is not biregular. To make it easy, I assumed that n=3 and that the vertices of V all have degree 4 except one of degree 5 (so each vertex of U is automatically adjacent to at least two vertices of degree 4). One option where the numbers work out is to have 7 vertices in U and 5 vertices in V, so if I set V = {A,B,C,D,E} and then make the 7 neighbourhoods equal to {ABC, ABD, ABE, ACE, ADE, BCD, CDE} then I think that vertex A has degree 5, and all the others degree 4. I don't know what sort of condition you'd need to rule out examples like this.. 

(Notice that minion makes the somewhat idiosyncratic decision to require equalities to be expressed as two opposite inequalities, but apart from that the syntax is obvious.) Then just run 

Let $\mathfrak{c}$ denote the cardinality of real numbers and let $(C_{\alpha}: \alpha < \mathfrak{c})$ be an enumeration of uncountable closed subsets of the unit square. Let Bob's strategy be playing a point $q_{\alpha} \in C_{\alpha}$ not already chosen at stage $\alpha$ for $\alpha < \mathfrak{c}$. This is possible since, at stage $\alpha < \mathfrak{c}$, the players could have chosen only less than $\mathfrak{c}$ many points of the set $C_{\alpha}$ which has cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$. Bob can do whatever he feels like for other ordinals. Note that the game will proceed at least $\mathfrak{c}$ stages since any curve connecting opposite sides contains $\mathfrak{c}$ many points. Any curve $C$ witnessing the victory of a player would be necessarily of the form $C_{\beta}$ for some $\beta < \mathfrak{c}$ and hence contains the point $q_{\beta}$. Thus Bob guarantees not losing if he plays with this strategy. (Of course, by using this strategy, Alice can guarantee not losing as well.) 

More added There are smaller 4-chromatic girth-5 graphs than Brinkmann's graph, because some of the examples that are appearing have fewer edges even though they have the same number of vertices. The search is about 10% complete and there are 7 graphs found so far. The prettiest one has just 40 edges and an automorphism group of order 5 consisting of a single fixed point and 4 5-cycles (which is vaguely reminiscent of Mycielski's construction). Final Addition After a little over 31 hours on the same multi-core machine, the computation of the full list of graphs with minimum degree at least 3, maximum degree at most 6 and girth at least 5 terminated. Of the 5006797077 graphs constructed, just 18 had chromatic number 4 and therefore have an equal claim to being the smallest 4-chromatic graphs of girth 5 (at least in terms of counting vertices). Among these graphs, 1 has 40 edges, 3 have 41, 12 have 42 and 2 have 43 edges. One is the 4-regular Brinkmann graph. The automorphism groups have orders 14 (Brinkmann graph), 5 (the element of order 5 has one fixed point and 4 x 5-cycles), 2 (8 times) and 1 (8 times). Some of the graphs are obtained from the others by adding/deleting an edge, but mostly not. For those interested, the graphs (in graph6 format) are as follows:
