One of the reasons is to avoid liability. If one person is considered to be in a position of power over another, and an outside-of-work relationship develops, should the relationship deteriorate the company may be found liable in a frivolous lawsuit suggesting that the under-employee felt their job security required they enter the relationship. 

I would bring it up, but I wouldn't pose it as a mistake on his part, instead I'd simply raise it as a question of understanding. 

Unfortunately you may already be past the point where you can easily prove he did not contribute to the project. Even if you can show he did little to no useful work, the fact that you both allowed him to continue to claim the work as partially his own in order to pass a course will make it hard for you to prove that he doesn't have any ownership claim to the IP of the project. This will come into play if, later, you do find success and he chooses to sue you. There are many high profile examples (facebook, for one) of founders coming back for a share of the company even after they were "let go". When you let him go, be up front, explain why, and ask him what, if any, claim he feels he has to the project. If necessary go over the code. If possible, work with a lawyer in the formation of the company and explain the situation. The best possible case probably won't happen - where he completely signs over any and all claim he had to you without recompense. However, once you've explained to him how little he's contributed, and received his side of the story and how much he believes he's contributed, you should then give him a share of the company. If your case that he contributed little is strong, he should be willing to settle for a single digit fraction of the company or less. Tell him you don't want him to provide further work. Document everything he has so far contributed, and as part of the contract that gives him a small share indicate that he accepts he has no further claim or interest in any of the IP, he signs everything away to the company for its exclusive use and ownership. Further, you should consider making sure his share does not provide him any voting or administrative rights. Having done that, you should have a pretty strong case if he does attack you later. Yes, you lose a very small portion of the company, but it may prevent a much larger share being taken by the courts later if you do succeed. Further, at some point you may be able to make him an offer to buy out his shares soon after formation or initial investment. Having an interest in the company and selling the shares later only solidifies his acceptance of the situation, and will provide adequate proof that he felt he was compensated appropriately for his early efforts. If you succeed, you will still make significantly more than him, and the small amount you lose should simply be considered part of doing business. It's probably a small risk, but he'll be much more likely to accept and sign such documents now than after the company is formed, so do this as early as possible. Then buy out his interest as early as possible. Also, consult with a lawyer and have them write everything up. If your company isn't that far along, then at least write down every contact you have with him regarding the business. You can make and sign informal agreements, but be careful - poorly written agreements may actually show him to be, in the eyes of the legal system, to be a more significant founder than he is. 

Approach #1 isn't supported by your counterpart, so I'd suggest using approach #2 and approaching HR together. Approach HR However, I wouldn't approach them with your current presentation. You have to understand what their goal is, and then help them to understand how their goal will fail if this continues. HR is tasked with 1) following government employment regulations and 2) structuring the employment in a manner that leaves them least exposed to employee lawsuits. They do a lot more, such as hiring, firing, etc - but those two primary goals are foundational and most of their other work is built on achieving them. About all they're allowed to do in terms of boss/subordinate relations is make sure the boss isn't doing something that is against the law or may expose the company to lawsuits. They have many tools to do this, and so not only do you have to convey that your boss's behavior exposes them to risk, but that the correct course of action is to make sure the boss follows a policy or procedure that reduces that risk, rather than eliminating the employees who don't like the current implementation. Present according to HR's goals In other words, HR is a hammer, and your problem needs to look like a nail. If you present a screw they may well try to hammer it down to the detriment of your goal. Therefore you need to understand what employment law may be involved, and what actual harm is being caused by this policy. Only then can you give them enough information and incentive to alter the situation. As such, your best option is to consult with a lawyer/solicitor familiar with employment law and find out what, if anything, about what your boss is doing is illegal or actionable. If nothing is, then you don't have a case you can bring to HR. You could attempt to bluff, or you could imply collective action, and perhaps that will spur them into action, but given that you don't already know what path is best I suspect these tactics may be unavailable to you. Approach Boss's Superior If you do choose #1, you need to do the same thing - understand your superior's goals, and then help them understand how the boss's actions are undermining their goals. You need to figure out how this actually affects the bottom line. Undertanding your Boss's Goal(s) Further, your write-up doesn't adequately express your boss's perspective. I suspect you may not be fully informed, and there may be reasons beyond immediate cost reduction. Perhaps he's been given the charge to reduce the staff count without firing without cause. Do you have a record of dismissals? Does it appear to be equal among all? Is he encouraging anger and outbursts in order to create a record so firing with cause may be an available option? Perhaps he was brought in so the company can restructure the department to a more normal 3 shift schedule with more replaceable (and cheaper) workers. A lot of this won't be visible to you, but if you can discern more of his goals and desires then you'll know whether #1 will be effective and how to approach it, as well as how to approach your boss directly again. Consider Other Tactics Lastly, what are the employees doing in response? Makeup, caffeine, 15 minutes of exercise before work, and a number of other tactics may be used to meet the subjective requirements of the new boss. It's going to be hard to prove that obvious signs of exhaustion, sleepiness, etc should prevent firing in a court of law, so even if you choose to go to HR or higher up you may be stuck with this situation. Consider all your options. 

If you travelled to a foreign country, started working there, and were told that giving a $50 gift to your assistant was a cultural expectation and company obligation by your superior (even if it's not "official" or written down anywhere) - would you follow their guidance, the prevailing culture, and the spoken obligation? I suspect you would. This is a business affair. Your superior has made it clear to you what the expectation is, the company is funding it (I assume so - if they're asking you to pay out of your own salary then you have every right to submit an expense report), and your own feelings on the matter are largely irrelevant. If you choose not to follow your boss's advice, explain your feelings and your refusal, don't let it slip by, just dropping the matter altogether. They will then have to decide if they have to discipline you, assign this task to someone else, or perhaps reassign your assistant so you no longer receive those services, so you don't feel obligated to participate in this cultural expectation. Either way, it should be very clear to you that this is a task your superior has given you, so whether you do it or not, report back to your superior with sufficient notice so they can assign it to someone else and meet company obligations. 

You do not need to mention the real issue. If she digs for a reason then you may want to bring it up, depending on your level of familiarity with her, but there's also the issue where she may be bringing a project to you for your benefit. She may not actually need you, and it is possible that her partner is unhappy with the situation and was unable to completely hide it during the discussion. 

Essentially you become an information hub, and you actively move information and the team's vision around so that everyone is on the same page. This can usually be done without process changes or approval, but it's time consuming. Lastly, if you want to discourage people from removing tasks, have a lengthy conversation about the task. Bring your chair into their office, and really get into the nitty gritty with them to make sure you fully understand what's going on. Don't just accept a quick flippant answer and move on, but really show that you want to understand the overall vision and understanding you have for the project. This accomplishes three things - one, you spend their time and eventually they'll learn that unless it's worth their time talking to you, it's probably better to let it slide. Two, you will gain their vision for the product/project, and hopefully over time they will gain your vision. Three, the relationship between you will hopefully improve and they will stop going straight to the boss, but to you. Always be friendly and humble, but fight for what you understand the vision of the product/project to be. If it becomes obvious they are defining the project, then talking with them and disseminating that information will be your best bet at unifying the team. Lastly, all this talking should give you an idea which tickets come by your desk that they are likely to reject. Go ask them about the ticket before working on it if it seems to be one they'd try to kill later. 

As others have said, this approach is unprofessional. The reason it's unprofessional, though is important: The salary is intended to have a direct relationship with how much they value your work. Your approach isn't negotiating a salary, it's negotiating a different relationship - rather than a salary you want a house. Most companies aren't in the housing business, and have no desire to be. They use the same relationship with all their employees - time and expertise for monetary and other benefit compensation. There may be some fields, or some cultures where the compensation is fundamentally different, and you can approach it from the angle of, "I want a house, you want work, let's make a deal." But I suspect in your field and culture, you are going to have to figure out how much money you need, and then bargain for that money without explaining why you need the money. The art of negotiation But, honestly, "professionalism" is only worthwhile when it works towards your goals. What you really need to focus on is, "How can I strengthen my negotiating position?" There are a lot of resources for that. The key, though, is that to obtain your own personal goals, you need to decouple them from your negotiations and use them only if they strengthen your position. Otherwise, look for other resources or knowledge that would strengthen your position. For some companies, or individuals you might be interviewing with, arguing about the cost of living in a given area might actually strengthen your position. For others, it might weaken it. There's no "one size fits all" for this situation, so you'll need to determine what strengthens your position in a given negotiation yourself. So don't worry about whether it's professional or acceptable. Instead, focus on whether it will achieve results in your negotiation. 

If you're going to push back, carefully read your NDA or job contract if you have either. Chances are good that you've signed something which requires you to keep certain company secrets, well, secret. That includes on linkedin or anywhere else they might be exposed to those outside your company. You boss is currently going the easy route and requesting that you do this, but they may have some legal levers they can pull if you choose not to comply. If you still decide you need to keep additional information on linkedin, consider going to your boss and listing the things you'd like to post publicly about, and have a discussion on which items you can and cannot list. It's a lot more work, and unless you're actively searching for a new job there is probably little reason to go to this much trouble, but you can keep a separate document to list activities and other sensitive information and add it to your linkedin once the contracts you've signed expire. 

Now that you've moved, he's less likely to give you a raise, as you've already shown you're willing to put up with a lot of inconveniences in order to stay with the company, but you already know he can afford it, you're still cheaper than the other interns, and as long as your work is equivalent he would be a poor business person if he shot you down. You have to be ready to leave, though. The "I enjoy working here and want to continue" is an implied "I'm going to leave if you don't meet my needs" and he's not going to respond positively if he thinks you're stuck and won't leave. Spend some time looking at the job market and gain some confidence you could leave and get another job without too much difficulty first and you'll have the confidence needed to have that discussion without discomfort. Note that I've worded it so there's no lie - you don't need the raise, and you've only pointed out that the cost of living is different, not better or worse, but he may push you to discuss your personal finances in order to make his case that you don't need more money. Resist the discussion of your personal finances, cost of living, etc. Just hold your ground, knowing the other interns get that much and live no differently, and haven't needed to justify their needs.
