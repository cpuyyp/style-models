This makes more sense, although in some (or even many) cases I think this is what is done. That is, there is also a grey area about the definition of life when someone seems to be in a coma, or brain dead, etc., and this does determine transplant decisions. Also, many medical decisions and attitudes are even formed based on how old a healthy person is, and the quality of their remaining expected lifetime, or the chances of them surviving a procedure, and how long and how well they are statistically expected to live after a procedure. These don't define the patient as "not life", but they do affect how much we invest in them, and whether we "let them die" in favor of others, or even just in favor of the time and resources and money of the medical industry. 

I agree that these are all problems where you have multiple people with different life prospects and chances of survival and resources to consider. However in this case I don't follow what you are saying about the fetus. It does seem to me that it would be relevant how important you considered the fetus' status to be. 

This question is difficult to answer because the idea of a "philosophical question" is very vague. The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast begins with Thales of Miletus (7th Century BCE), and a number of sources list him as the first identifiable philosopher in the Western tradition. However in a more general sense you would also be able to argue that philosophy has existed almost as long as society - any parent who has had to explain to their questioning child why it is important to treat other people well, for example, could be said to be "doing philosophy" in a broad sense. 

In classical propositional logic, an argument is invalid iff. there is a situation in which the premises can be true and the conclusion false. So by that measure (assuming that you have premises that can possibly be all true at one time) your argument that concludes in a contradiction would be invalid. However, what is worth noting is that you didn't state was what kind of logic is being used to analyze this argument - Paraconsistent logics such as dialetheism accept that there can be true contradictions, which can throw a spanner in the works here. 

Note: This probably applies to many other similar questions, such as proof for one of the many multi-verse hypotheses, proof for free will/dualism, etc. I think it may also work for proof of alien encounters... 

Pascal's wager assumes there is a heaven and a hell, and that heaven is better. It also provides a very vague term "believe" to indicate how one gets to heaven. It would seem better definition of these terms is required to even evaluate Pascal's wager. Likely an analysis of it could be made based on each different worldviews that exists. i.e. If Christianity is true, then x. If Buddhism is true, then y. Etc. As another answer mentioned, the wager may require not only that you "believe", but that belief may require action - following the religion. In reality, there are a LOT of people that have taken Pascal's wager - they don't necessarily believe in the core tenets of the religion, but due to culture, duty, fear of what really happens at death, etc., they do follow through with some, many, or all of the religion's dictates. Not everyone in this category realizes philosophically that this is the situation they are in... 

Again this is a complex scenario that doesn't have one answer from logic, but I wouldn't disagree that limited resources need to be allocated, and it makes sense to have a "disinterested expert" select - although the criteria are again going to have to be chosen, probably based on some grey areas. This is an interesting example though because here you have two different families facing death competing for limited resource that the medical establishment (and legal system) controls, deciding who is likely to live or die. However in the abortion case, you have a pregnant woman's choice of whether to abort a pregnancy, and are proposing that the legal system declare the fetus as inviolate life and deny her that choice (which risks her own life, in some cases greatly or, in rare cases, even certainly) about her own potential future child and her own life, with no one else involved. And there is also the situation to consider that the result of illegalizing abortion is not the prevention of abortion, but causing women to get dangerous black market (or improvised) abortions instead. 

Counter-Factuals (CFs) are possible actions. But all possible actions are not guaranteed to be actualizable actions. They miss a piece of Plantinga's argument which they even quote: ".. he will take at least one wrong action" 

Note that if we are to make that evaluation (and I am convinced we are not properly equipped to do so), we have no idea what other factors are involved. For example, is God mitigating evil already so that it is not as bad as it might have been? Also, this doesn't take into the equation any metaphysical considerations about individual accounting for deeds done in this life, heaven/hell or any other considerations of this life compared to the afterlife. If you are going to "weigh the evil" and define an amount that is "too much", it really needs to be an equation which weighs all factors, in which case we need more information to solve for "x". 

while your premises are essentially statements of fact about the same issue, not asking whether life is inviolate or not, or whether different stages of fetus are life or not, or whether life's inviolate-ness trumps a woman's choice, or not. In the last line of your final question, this premise/conclusion is directly stated: "the only real issue on the table: life". You did write in your third paragraph "if a foetus doesn't yet count as life, then no such rules apply." but you don't ever address that issue after that. You also don't address the other non-premise questions I mentioned in the above paragraph. So sure, if your premise is right that killing fetuses is always wrong and "the only real issue on the table", then you are right... that that is your premise. 

I would suggest the opposite: that a pregnant woman is typically the person most interested (and most expert) in the life of the fetus inside them, even in cases where they choose to abort. Expertness and interest are themselves subjective or at least not-clearly-defined terms, as is their degree of relevance. Your "Life and choice matrix" just seems to graphically show the result of your postulates that a fetus is life and that life is inviolate and that the inviolateness of life trumps a woman's choice. 

Postscript: I think where most people get tripped up is by assuming the entire universe is one big integrated causal/determined system and nothing can/does exist outside the universe, and deny any form of dualism (or separate causal chains) within the universe. If that is true, then I believe there are no free actions/free will actions because nothing exists outside of the system under inspection. Of course, it is currently impossible to prove that is the state of the universe. 

So, what is the answer? 1. Is there any way to "prove" any given logically consistent epistemological system is true? 2. Or is Dr. Clark correct that there is no belief-neutral, obvious, and simple foundation we can base beliefs of propositional truths upon? 

Edit: the answers so far seem to want to redefine theology or other terms - that is fine, but please be clear that you are redfining them, and provide, if possible, sources for why the term should be different than given (support from historical works, other sites, etc.). 

It seems to me that there is no one right logical answer to this. It's about culture and moral codes and law and circumstances more than it is about logic. For example, someone might argue that a country that put a mother in such a situation and won't relieve it is at cause in threatening the survival of these children, and a mother put in this situation might be morally justified in considering sacrificing one to save the rest (although one might hope she'd orphan the child rather than kill it, etc). 

For this to be well-defined, one would need to define "life" and say what "rules" one means, as well as what stages of "foetus". 

My answer would clearly be: no. Hijacking is a loaded word. You don't explain how this argument from adverse consequences would work, but I assume you are suggesting that the pro choice movement is suggesting that a foetus is not inviolate life because unwanted pregnancies have bad effects on women's lives? I don't think I've ever heard anyone argue that, so no. And I don't agree with your premise that the "only real issue on the table" is "life", so no. I think the comment that goldilocks made about this "begging the question" is accurate: you seem to have unquestioned premises that a fetus is "inviolate life", and that that trumps a woman's choice about whether to bear the child or not. All your conclusions on the question of abortion rights seem to just be direct consequences of assuming those premises to be true. If we instead start with a premise that, just to pick another arbitrary example, that the ancient Roman attitude that a child isn't a person yet until a year after birth is instead our premise, then we'd have very different "real issues" and very different conclusions. Postscript: To respond to your comment by explain why I think you're "begging the question" here. I don't mean this ad hominem, or to suggest you're intentionally doing this. Begging the question is where your conclusion is essentially the same as the premise you start with. The questions you stated were: 

By definition, an argument is valid if the premises and our accepted working of logical rules create a situation such that if all of the premises are true, then the conclusion cannot be false. From the detail in your question I assume you are aware of this much. Having redundant premises is not a problem. For example, I could make a simple argument: 

The only way I can see of doing this would be to create a truth table/tree/etc. and then by brute force check to see which premises have no effect on the truth-value of the conclusion. Then if you find such a premise, you know that it is redundant (and sometimes this happens entirely innocently, but because one of the premises e.g. becomes part of a larger tautology of which several of the components are not needed). P.S. This is just speculation, but I suspect that this problem arises because of the assumption that if someone includes a statement in their argument, then they must believe that the statement lends logical support to its conclusion. This could actually lead to an interesting discussion about whether when we make an argument we are also creating a second logical argument in tandem that asserts that the logic used in the original holds water, and that both of these 'sub-arguments' need to give a true conclusion for the 'argument' as a whole to be 'acceptable'. This would be why we can attack an argument by attacking it's use of logic instead of simply trying to disprove its premises, and the statement "Premise A is relevant to the conclusion", "Premise B is relevant to the conclusion", etc. might be implicit (or not) in that tandem argument. 

This presupposes first that there is God or a god to talk to. Also, to forward the argument, let's assume that it is actually best not to attempt to pray/talk to God. So, how would anyone know this? First one would have to have a worldview/theology in which to understand the purpose of talking to God. If God himself doesn't command us not to talk to him, we would have to understand it from the teachings or theology of the worldview we had. For example, the Christian religion gives many examples of prayer, and teaches that people should pray - for example, the disciples asked Jesus "Teach us how to pray" - and he obliged them. Jesus himself is described as praying many times and then is described as giving us an example of how to live, so clearly Christianity would not fit into this mold - it argues for believers to pray and have a relationship with God and/or Jesus. Other worldviews may not come to this view, but that would be determined through their assumptions about God and the world, and would need to be determined through investigation into their teachings and practice. For example, my understanding of Buddhism is that you do not pray in the sense that you talk to God, but you do meditate, which is intended to further one's spiritual life, but apart from God/god(s). This is based on Buddhism's understanding of the world and what our purpose as humans is in the world. So, in the end, the idea of whether you should or need to talk to God or pray just flows naturally from an understanding of a worldview or religion. Even in the case that God himself, or one of his prophets, specifically tells you to pray or not to pray, that will be a command that is based on the presuppositions and framework of a specific religion or worldview only, and other worldviews would not be bound to it. You still would need to choose which worldview that you wish to subscribe to in order to understand the application of your question to yourself.
