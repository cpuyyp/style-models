In a young planet, oxygen can be produced from water vapor via photodissociation, which occurs along a pathway like $$\text{H}_2\text{O}+h\nu\to\text{H}+\text{OH}$$ $$\text{H}+\text{OH}+h\nu\to2\text{H}_2+\text{O}$$ $$\text{O}+\text{O}\to\text{O}_2$$ In The Atmosphere and Ocean: A Physical Introduction, Wells writes (p. 26) 

This is trickier. According to the dynamo theory, the magnetic field is governed by the induction equation $$\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\eta\nabla^2\mathbf{B}+\nabla \times (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B})$$ where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\mathbf{u}$ is velocity, $t$ is time and $\eta=1/\sigma\mu$, where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity and $\mu$ is the permeability. Note that nowhere in there is a term involving the radius of the core. In the nonlinear theory, density does come into it. But that's the density of the material in the core. The planet could have a large mantle that contributes significantly to its radius. So the magnetic field can be any (reasonable) strength you want; it might not be impacted by planetary radius. The tricky thing is that while the magnetic field protects us from the solar wind, we also have to worry about UV radiation. That's why the ozone layer is our saving grace, so to speak, and why its depletion by chlorofluorocarbons is such a big deal. I bring this up because a planet with certain characteristics (i.e. much bigger and yet less massive) will have a weaker gravitational pull on its atmosphere (with the strength depending on radius and mass). Lighter gases escape easier from a given planet than do heavy gases. That's why the Earth lost any primordial hydrogen and helium envelope it might have had. Make this planet too big and you risk losing ozone. Sure, the planet would have to be pretty big (while staying at the same mass), but it could happen. A stronger magnetic field might solve this, but its contributions might not be too great. 

This collision could have happened at a variety of angles and at a variety of speeds, and could have led to a variety of outcomes. The angle of impact was only about 45 degrees. A more direct blow could have destroyed Earth. 

Have them magically absorb neutrinos. Fun fact of the day: There are $\sim10^{11}$ neutrinos passing through every square centimeter on Earth every second. And they just go straight through. Neutrinos - "little neutral ones", if you like - are tiny leptons, uncharged particles with very low masses, if any. They interact with other particles through the weak nuclear force - which is, as you can imagine, weak. Neutrinos coming from the Sun would need to pass through one light-year of lead to have a high probability if interacting with another particle. That's how weakly they interact. The point of this is that you don't notice neutrinos easily. It's extremely difficult to detect them, even with state-of-the art detectors. I think they would be a perfect energy source for you - and yes, they come from the Sun and other stars, produced in nuclear reactions! My proposal for your magic system: 

Let's forget the climbers now. They won't make it to the top any time soon. Group 2: The scientists The scientists might also start on foot. A lot of expeditions have historically been motivated by glory, but many have also been motivated by scientific discovery. There are questions to be answered, and countless geologists would love to solve the puzzle of this mountain. Going on foot will soon be discarded by the scientists. Unlike the climbers, the problem isn't only about the journey; it's about the destination. That will eventually include the summit. But how can they get there? Traditional planes and helicopters are out. You can land a helicopter on Mount Everest, but it's dangerous. Going 50 miles in the sky is impossible in such a device. Landing on the mountain is not going to happen. What about jumping? High-altitude ballooning was possible in the 1950s . . . from maybe only 20,000 feet. Even Felix Baumgartner hasn't jumped from 50 miles up. Plus, they'd need extreme accuracy, whether jumping from a balloon or an aircraft. If you miss this peak, you're going to die. Also, it might be a suicide mission - although people are willing to go to Mars and never come back. So, you can't get to the summit by going up. You can't get to it by flying straight across the sky. Can you get to from . . . space? Maybe! Something like a space elevator could be useful (depending on the latitude of the mountain). Simply put a satellite in geostationary orbit and build down to the top of the mountain. The big drawback? We're almost a century past 1920, and we haven't figured that one out. But then again, we haven't had the impetus to do it. This might be the only way to get to the summit. Some interesting developments will come out of all of this: 

A recent Snowball Earth period might help. Heavy glaciation can cause enormous changes to the terrain. There are no longer any glaciers where I live, but there once were, during a recent ice age. Their legacy includes 

Absolutely. This would only take a few simply steps, and a small bit of luck. Here's how it could happen: 

There are other factors that will change. This would all be okay. The problem is, this means that the civilizations will really develop in different worlds. Not all will be helpful for this particular species. For example, humans couldn't have survived for long during the Cretaceous Period. Eventually, the next-in-line will be wiped out before they can attain intelligence. I think that's the "one most important factor." 

I think, then, that the closest comparable event would be a helium flash, although helium flashes are typically not visible outside the host star. A possible failed annihilation After doing some more thinking, I considered that the collision might only directly result in a partial annihilation of both planets - stopped, interestingly enough, by the radiation emitted from the initial collision. When an electron and a positron annihilate, gamma rays are produced: $$e^-+e^+\to\gamma+\gamma$$ each photon has an energy of about $0.511\text{ MeV}$. If there are $\sim10^{50}$ atoms in the world, then there are at least $\sim10^{50}$ electrons (we assume that there is at least one proton for atom, and that most atoms are electrically neutral). If each photon has a momentum $p=E/c$, then each collision produces two photons of momentum $2.73\times10^{-22}\text{kg m s}^{-1}$. If each planet is traveling at 30 km/s,2 it has a momentum $\sim10^{29}\text{kg m s}^{-1}$. Therefore, if perhaps $\sim5\times10^{49}$ electrons are annihilated in the earliest phase of the collision - roughly one half - and one photon from each annihilation travels towards one of the planets,3 then $\sim10^{28}\text{kg m s}^{-1}$ worth of momentum would oppose each moving planet. We might have underestimated the number of electrons in Earth, and if we're off by an order of magnitude, the annihilation of half of the planets could blow away (and blow apart) the remnants. We also haven't taken into account photons produced by proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron annihilations, which should produce even more photons of higher energies (as the masses of protons and neutrons are much, much greater than the mass of an electron). In short, I think the collision would pan out something like this: 

Take some dilute sulphuric acid. Put small pieces of metal in the acid - iron, zinc and aluminum should all work. Capture the resulting hydrogen gas, and then put it in your airship. 

No, because of Hamilton's equations and conservation laws. At some time $t$, the configuration of the universe is represented (classically) by a point in phase space. Phase space describes the position and momentum of the components of a system. We can define these locations using canonical coordinates $q_i$ and $p_i$ (components of the vectors denoting objects' locations in space and momenta). Hamilton's equations say that $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{q}}$$ $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{q}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{H}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}$$ This describes how the configuration of the universe changes in phase space over time - in other words, how the universe evolves. Normally, this could be represented by a smooth curve. In this case, however, at some time $t_1$, there is a discontinuity, where $|\mathbf{p}|=0$. From God's perspective, you have a finite $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}$ and a vanishing $\mathrm{d}t$, which means an infinite force, as $\mathbf{F}=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}$. That quite clearly violates the laws of physics. 

Johannes Gutenberg Gutenberg is famous for his development of the printing press. The printing press was important for several reasons. It helped humanists in the high Renaissance spread their ideas. It brought religion to the masses. However, most importantly, it made it possible for scientists to share their ideas widely. When the time came for Newton and others to write, they had all the tools they needed to make sure everyone knew about their work, so people could improve and build on it, spearheading the advancement of science and technology. Kill Gutenberg and this development is a lot harder. 

I could go on to non-Abrahamic religions, but I think you get the gist. The synopses I've given above, I should note, are condensed and simplified. In other words, there's a loophole to the death-by-virus-gives-you-immortality, making it impossible to gain immortality though suicide. The elders/leaders of the tribe simply have to codify a rule against it, stating that anyone who kills themselves in good health will not gain immortality, but will suffer some suitable punishment instead. 

Let's imagine that the hottest part of the apparatus is the barrel, so to speak, which is cylindrical with length $l$, radius $r$ and temperature $T_b$. We can surround it with a fluid of temperature $T_f$. Now, the barrel has a heat transfer coefficient of $h$. The change in heat energy of the barrel over time, $\dot{Q}$, is $$\dot{Q}=hA\Delta T=h(2\pi rl)\left(T_b-T_f\right)$$ where $A$ is the surface area of the barrel. Some things immediately spring out: 

Earth, the inner planets and other small bodies coalesce in the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Over the years, they grow from their diminutive initial states to more planet-like sizes. One day, a large protoplanet nicknamed Theia hits Earth. Material from Theia and Earth is ejected out into space. Some of this material falls back to Earth (which contains part of the now-destroyed Theia). The rest coalesces to form the Moon. 

The body must be a black body (although changing $\epsilon$ could fix some of that The body must be in thermal equilibrium (which is almost certainly not the case) 

It must be relativistic, meaning it's quite complicated. It's not actually well-known, and is an active area of study. 

Even 1,000 years seems pretty good. Yes, this isn't going to be nearly enough time for life to evolve, and neither will 100,000 years. But it's really good to sustain intelligent life that's already evolved - in this case, humans. I should note, though, that any body large enough to cause a crater taking up that much of the planet is liable to have terrible consequences, destroying much on the surface - if not the entire planet. This means that it isn't feasible for the crater to cover a substantial portion of the planet. 

That's it. You hit the nail on the head. Each re-generation is inheriting a completely different planet than the last. Some things that would change: 

To more specifically address the question of whether or not we could notice it, the answer is simple: No. If everything has been paused, then nothing should have changed during the "time" elapsed for God during the pause. There's simply no way to tell, because nothing is different. 

I do have one final note. Giacomo Catenazzi pointed out that the length of a year - the time it takes Earth to move around the Sun, from an astronomical point of view - has changed over time. Over the long term, we can calculate tidal recession effects from the Sun, and over the short term, we can calculate precession changes (see Simon et al. (1993)), but as Giacomo pointed out, this is not necessarily enough early in Earth's history. Even as late as the Late Heavy Bombardment, there could have been other changes from impacts and various other events. I'll still hold that our models can account for most of these discrepancies, but he's right; they can't account for all of them. 

Xenonucleic acids (XNAs) (see also Wikipedia) may be what you're looking for. XNAs are nucleic acids related to DNA, some of which can store information for organisms in the same way that DNA does for life as we know it. These six are

Disclaimer: I'm not a police officer, detective, law enforcement official, crime scene investigator . . . You get the idea. That said, here are some ideas: 

The issue? Both are long and cylindrical - most times, they're larger than they are wide. If you have a cylinder with a diameter akin to that of the Death Star, it will end up being much bigger than the Death Star. So in reality, we're left with a much smaller telescope. But I think we may ignore that error. MarchHo suggested putting a reflecting mirror at the telescope's focal point, as is often seen in radio telescopes. It's certainly feasible, and would mean that the telescope could be a lot smaller - essentially a parabolic mirror floating in space (come to think of it, the depression in the Death Star from where the laser exits is shaped a lot like that). It's certainly an option that would solve the issues presented above. Anyway, we can use the figure of $D=160,000$ meters for our calculations. We might as well be optimistic. The collection area for a telescope depends largely on its primary mirror. We can compare two telescopes, saying that telescope $A$ gathers a certain amount of light compared to $B$, given by $$\frac{\pi R_A^2}{\pi R_B^2}$$ Take the James Webb Space Telescope. Its mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter. This means that our telescope has a collecting area $$\frac{\pi 80,000^2}{\pi 3.25^2}=6.05917 \times 10^8$$ times that of the James Webb Space Telescope. Does that mean its angular resolution is that many times smaller? No, because angular resolution scales linearly with diameter, whereas this comparison is a quadratic scale. But the difference is still extremely impressive. 

Alaska There is, of course, a strong Alaskan independence movement led by the Alaskan Independence Party, an extremely large (relatively) third party. It has over 15,000 members. Interestingly enough, among their key principles are the desires to uphold a person's Constitutional rights and state/individual rights. It sounds like they would be eager to go for independence in the scenario you described. In fact, the AIP got enough support to introduce a proposal for secession on the fall ballot in 2006. They have a decent amount of strength, for a secessionist movement.1 Alaska as a whole is also apparently a stronghold of libertarianism. Things in favor of Alaska in the case of secession:
