Here is an actual exercise, but I recommend to do it with no weight at all so it actually becomes a dynamic stretch really. The important thing here is that you have to go ALL the way down, and when you come up, push your hips out during the squat. This is probably hands down the best way to improve hip mobility. At first you want be able to squat all the way down that low, but trust me if you practice you will be extremely flexible and the squat transfers well into running sports. 

Most studies have shown meal timing isn't relevant in terms of weight gain. At the end of the day of course- it just matters on the calories from the specific macronutrients you are eating. That being the case, its probably better to eat the majority of your food during a time you are generally active, or right after a workout, just so you get the energy from the food. The reason you are losing weight is because you aren't eating enough, it has nothing to do with when you eat. Do not worry about your meal timing, just make sure you are eating enough for whatever goals you have in mind ( losing weight, gaining weight). Try to schedule some meals around the times you will workout or do something relatively active, since it might give you a boost of energy. Edit: See $URL$ $URL$ The idea that increased meal frequency contributes to any noticeable caloric loss and thus leading to potential extra weight loss has been debunked and has never been proven by any scientific studies. Please feel free to comment a study that says otherwise, however please make sure it has references. 

Your 'natural' body-mass percentages are hugely affected by genetics. Your hormone levels control how much muscle-mass you will have with any given level of activity. It's entirely possible you're genetically gifted. If you start lifting weights more regularly, and get a solid plan for your diet, you could end-up being quite muscular. The flip side is the body-fat % test might be waaayyyy off. Was it a body-caliper test? They can have major discrepancies, even when done by a doctor. 

Yes, but not as much as you'd get from standard weightlifting. How much all depends on how much muscle you have currently, and what your genetics (e.g. testosterone levels) are. If you DO pursue bouldering, be sure to spend some time doing 'pushing' exercises (push-ups, overhead-pressing, etc) to keep your shoulders balanced. Otherwise you might be at risk for an injury. 

The key thing to track one's weight is consistency. If each day you weigh yourself on the same scale, wearing the same clothes, and with roughly the same food/water/excreta weight, you should be getting a acceptably consistent weight. You ARE correct that different exercises and water intake will significantly shift one's weight one way or another. Perhaps these individuals are carefully tracking their water-intake and output. There's also no harm in weighing yourself more often (so long as you take the appropriate number of 'grains of salt' with that measurement). Also - if someone was trying to sweat-out a certain poundage on a treadmill (i.e. so they could 'make weight' as a boxer or MMA fighter) Lastly, many people are dumb and assume that a 30-minute treadmill session will result in several pounds of fat loss, and they're trying to instantly see the results of their efforts. 

The warm-up dynamic stretches routine (~5min): shoulder rolls scapular shrugs cat-camels band: straight arm overhead pull downs band: straight arm chest flies band: dislocates wrist mobility exercises front and side leg swings 

My advice would be to train for skill acquisition, like in gymnastics. There are endless skills to get, so there's plenty of variety, it's very fun IMO 

Pushup progression Vertical Pushup Incline Pushup (lowering the incline over time) Full Pushup Diamond Pushup Rings Wide Pushup / If no rings -> pseudo planche pushups (PPPU) Rings Pushup RTO Pushup (Rings Turned Out) RTO PPPU 

These should keep you busy quite a while. Some of these do require sp√©cial equipment that you'll only find in a gymnasium, but most of if can be done without 

APT or lower cross syndrome means that your hip flexors and your lower back are tight and overactive, and that your glutes/hamstring and abs are weak and not active enough. So what you need is ab exercises that don't work your hip flexors (so not crunches and not L-sits), glute exercises that don't work your lower back, and stretching your tight hip flexors and lower back. Glute/hamstring exercises: Squats, deadlifts, stiff legged deadlifts, glute bridges, hip thrusts, weighted hip thrusts, this Ab exercises that don't work your hip flexors: hollow body holds (your lower back needs to stay in contact with the floor at all times), planks done right (with the pelvis in a posterior tilt, the video also shows how to make them harder) Hip Flexor stretches: this You also should minimize sitting without frequent pauses, and make a conscious effort to fix your pelvis position thoughout the day As for frequency, 10 minutes of stretching every morning would be great. The glute and abs training 3 times a week would be great You can also check that out $URL$ 

You likely experienced 'The Pump' - i.e. a temporary swelling of a well-used muscle due to additional blood-flow. It can last for several hours, but after the 12 hour period since your workout, it certainly could have faded. It's completely normal - don't worry too much about small changes to muscle-size. 

Yes, but it depends on how advanced you are. If you've been lifting for several years, you'll generally need to focus more and more on one aspect of training in order to see results. If you're just starting out, you'll get stronger/faster/bigger/leaner doing practically any kind of weightlifting. But as those 'newbie gains' taper off, most lifters find they need to program their training to concentrate on specific goals. Exactly when that transition occurs depends on how often you train, how intensely you train, and your own genetics/hormone levels. 

Fingertip push-ups are one option, but you'd have better luck with any number of grip exercises for forearm development: 

Short answer: You should be overloaded at the end of each SET. For most lifters, you'll want to be near or at the point of failure at the end of each set. That's generally how you stimulate muscles to get stronger/bigger/more enduring. That said, there's certainly specialty training protocols that differ from this, injury recovery, or if a set is a warm-up set, or if it's some kind of exotic pre-exhausting super-set scheme idea. But for your standard weightlifting goals, overload yourself on each and every set. 

Ankle weights are mainly useful for abs by making Toes to bar, L-sits, and Hollow holds harder, they can also be used for glutes and hamstrings (Reverse hyperextensions, and Arch holds) and if you are there, you can also make your handstand pushups harder with them 

If you have belly, chances are that you have a high bodyfat percentage, when you don't weigh much and have a high bf%, people call that being skinnyfat. If you're 137 pounds, you don't really have a lot of fat to lose, it's more of an all around lack of muscle to balance everything than a big excess of fat, what you need to do to lose appearance of a belly is to lower your bf% by adding muscle while not gaining (or even losing some) fat. To do that, you need to do stimulate your muscles with strength training and to have your diet in check. For the diet, you can track calories with something MyFitnessPal, but IMO it's not that necessary and you should be alright by just keeping the alcohol to a minimum and eating lots of a veggies everyday For the strength training, you have lots of options, by example you can join a gym and do a begginer program like Phrak's GreySkull LP variant or do a bodyweight routine like the r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine at home 

Strength program with a 3x5 program for 12 weeks Take a week off Hypertrophy program 4x8 for another 8 weeks Another week off Repeat 

Horizontal rows are generally better for correcting posture in deskbound workers. You should be looking to strengthen your rear-shoulder muscle-groups: Trapezius, scapular deltoid, rhomboids, scapular retractors. Any sort of horizontal row where you keep your elbows high will do the trick. In addition, try any of the following: 

We evolved to find calorie-dense foods very tasty, and we don't have taste-receptors for micro-nutrients When humans (and most of their predecessors) did most of our evolving, low-calorie plants were plentiful. Sweet fruit wasn't usually around all year. Meat could be hunted, but it required plenty of energy and effort, and was usually quite lean. (Much like wild game caught today.) Even the plant we know of today as broccoli had fewer calories and probably more nutrition. We probably ate piles and piles of plants that had LOADS of vitamins just to get enough calories to live. To that end we have greatly modified our food supply to be both more delicious, more calorie-dense, but unfortunately less nutrient-dense. You can look into the now trendy "Paleo-Diet" - which attempts to mimic the diet of our ancestors in order to be more healthy. (Mind you, there's plenty of debate about it's effectiveness.) 

In short You cant spot reduce fat. You can lose fat. You can gain muscle. But they don't convert into one another. 

Spot Reducing fact is not possible. There is no controversy. Many youtube videos and journals on this. See here Blood Flow and lyposis.. Fat is not converted into muscle. Beginner weightlifters can loose fat, and gain muscle at the same time. Generally after six months this is not possible by 99.99% of the population, unless incredible genetics are present. The idea after losing your "noob gains" (The fact that you are able to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time during your first several months of lifting), is one of the following 

This is a static stretch Heres another good hip movement which is great for flexibility. I'm actually not too sure what this is exactly called, but I and several other athletes generally do this at the end of the workout ( this is a static stretch) 

If you have no access to a gym (get a membership!) you can try the exercise in the picture below. This will work as the same effect, but make sure you are pausing at the highest point of the abduction. If you are new to this you probably can't raise your legs too high. 

The greater the weight, the greater the gains to strength and power. Alwyn Cosgrove in 'The New Rules of Lifting' recommends switching between strength and hypertrophy programs every 8-16 weeks. E.g. 

This workout is OK, but not great. You'll certainly see progress if you're just starting out, but likely you'll stall-out after a while. Here's a rundown of some improvements you could make: There's not quite enough volume. 9-10 sets per workout isn't usually enough. Aim for 15-20. This is a bodypart-split. Ideally, each muscle-group would get trained 2-3 times per week. Here, your quads get a workout once, whereas hamstrings are completely ignored. You should add a deadlifting day. Too much isolation for your Bi's and Tri's. Biceps and triceps are rather small muscles and working them isn't going to be as efficient as working bigger muscle-groups. Don't do bicep curls, do pull-downs/pull-ups/rowing. Swap the tricep dips for bench-press. Do more squats and deadlifting, your body is a machine that needs to stay balanced. This is a routine, you need a program. Look-up 'Starting Strength', 'Strong Lifts', or 'The New Rules of Lifting'. All of those describe a complete program (i.e. multiple routines, how to do them, how many repetitions, tempo, etc.) from just starting out, to how to progress once you've made it past the newbie-gains stage. 

You don't need to work out 5 days a week, if you're not enjoying it anymore, there's no point. Do it 3 times a week and you'll be fine. Rest on the other days. You may need to adjust your routine (maybe full body instead of a muscle split if that's what you're doing), but it will give you more time to yourself and more time for your muscle to rebuild after you break them down. 3 lifting sessions a week is enough to be quite fit. You can also do a stretching routine to work on your mobility at home instead of going to the gym/crossfit on your off-days, it's less of hassle IMO Also why do you go to 2 different places (with 2 different subscriptions I assume) ? Can't you do everything you want to do at one place ? Personally, what I do is that I go to a gymnastic gym twice a week, to have access to parallel bars, rings, pommel horses, etc, and do my skill training plus a strength training session (pushups, dips, pullups, rows, handstands, deadlift), and do one session a week at home of just bodyweight strength training. I like that it's so varied, and it gives me at least a day between training sessions 

Yes, depending on your goals Resetting your grip likely takes a bit of time, perhaps a few seconds, perhaps 10 or more. During this time, your hamstrings are (mostly) resting. This changes the results of the exercise somewhat. From a hypertrophy standpoint, the more you are 'resting' between reps, the more you're losing a bit of Time-Under-Tension, which means the muscles will have a little bit less stimulus to grow. From a strength standpoint, the more you rest the more muscle-fibers will be ready-to-fire, so you'll have more strength to pull with. In other words, if you're taking enough time to reset your grip so that your 5x5 protocol is becoming more of a 1x25 protocol, it's going to change what you get out of your workout. 

If your goal is aesthetics, you're going to need bigger muscles and less body-fat. The trick here is most folks can't lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. You need to pick one, do that for 3-6 months, then switch to the other. Either order works, you can grow some muscle, then strip fat, or vice-versa. Just pick one and stick with it. 2.) You don't do any lower-body weightlifting Squat. Deadlift. Lunge. Do them. Do lots of them. You'll get more upper-body development if you do both upper-and-lower than just upper-body stuff. Lower-body movements tend to trigger more anabolic hormones. 3.) Too much cardio, not enough weightlifting Cardio is great if the goal is 'Be able to do more cardio'. If you're training for a marathon, you better get running. If you can run a 5K, then you're probably pretty good in terms of general fitness. I'd go down to 1 day of cardio a week, and go with three days of weightlifting. You can narrow-down the rowing-machine warmup to 2-3 minutes, and cut-out the walking afterwards. Speaking of which, you're not doing enough sets to really simulate muscle-growth. I usually 12-16 weightlifting sets per workout. **4.) Find a real workout program ** You're running into a common problem. You started lifting, made some rapid progress, but now you're plateauing pretty bad. As others have stated, you need to change things up somewhat. A full program is beyond the scope of a post here, so I'd look into The New Rules of Lifting or Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength. Both have solid, full-caliber programs to make you strong, lean, and muscular.
