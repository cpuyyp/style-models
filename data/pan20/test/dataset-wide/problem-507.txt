Tire Lever aka Tire Iron A tire lever is a small, narrow lever used to help lift a tire off a rim. Traditionally they were steel, later aluminium alloy and now most commonly they are plastic. The most important feature of a tire lever is that it does not have any sharp edges that may "pinch" the tube (that is, become wedged between the tube and the tire) causing a small hole or tear in the tube. Operation of tire levers usually involves either a pair or a triple set of levers. Levers can also be used help get a tire onto a rim when it is a particularly tight fit. 

The Vittoria Rubino Pro's have a kevlar bead (foldable) and in the past I have found them to be excellent value for money. Maybe too much orange? 

In cycle racing, there are five grades or categories for climbs - Category 4, 3, 2, 1 & Hors (Above Category or HC). How do they decide what is category 1 and what makes it so hard it is a HC? 

I have some foldable racing tyres, still with plenty of tread but with some small cuts through the tread & cloth. Can I do anything to them or are they destined for the bin? 

After reading through the ACCC's web page on the new standard, the 12 of December change only applies to retailers. The VicRoads website only mentions that you have to have a helmet that reaches AS/NZS 2063, not the year of the standard. Personally, I am due for a new helmet, my current one being well over 2 years old, and I will be looking for one that meets the improved standard, since this indicates that the protection it offers in all situations is as good if not better. The materials and techniques in a more recent helmet will be improved compared to one designed two years ago. I think my head is worth more than the money I would save from a cheaper, inferior helmet. 

As others have pointed out studded tires are most effective against ice. As for weight on front wheel, yes it is important to have some. But you do not want to lean heavy and make your hands heavy and stiff. You want them to be light, quick to react and precise. You also want your upper body to be flexible and quick to react. 

There are many styles of bicycle racks available. If you are concerned with space they use, you could check Vertical bike rack which can provide high density of parked bicycles in small space. 

Do new hubs usually come adjusted, or one needs to adjust them prior to use. I have a new Shimano Claris hub, and it does not seem to be as smooth rolling as my previous Tiagra hub. Should I try to adjust it, or leave it as is? 

26" wheels are stronger than 28" wheels but I think you can get 28" wheel suitable for your weight that will last. Whatever size you choose I would advise you to invest in your rear wheel instead of using stock wheel you get from the shop. Buy strong rim suitable for 36 spokes, find a reputable wheel builder in your area, and ask him to build a wheel with quality spokes. Also if you are buying new bicycle, make sure your position on it is ok. If you are for instance sitting to far back, that will affect weight distribution, and your rear wheel will have to bear even more stress. There are more options to make stronger rear wheel, like using 40 or more spokes, wider rear axle, non dished rear wheel with internal hub, etc But all these require significantly larger investment than just getting strong well built rear wheel. 

You may consider contracting some custom frame builder, if you shop around you could get custom frame set in range of $2k maybe less, which would leave you $1k for rest of the bike . A quick google search showed some builders even locally in Pittsbourgh, although it is often not necessary that they are located in the same town. 

Usually the pin through the link is a different colour, for example black instead of the more usual brass. 

Start by finding some imperfection in the surface - like just a tiny bit of a dip or lump. Roll your front wheel up to the point by pushing very slightly on the pedals and then once you feel the resistance from point to your movement ease off on the pedals and roll back. Keep doing this and you will find that you can balance on the point with only the very slightest of movements. You just alternate between applying a little bit of pressure on the pedals to the pedals applying a bit of pressure back to you. Even with a freewheel you will get some back pressure. When you come to a non flat surface, there are two things to do. If you are facing up hill, then turn your front wheel almost 45 degrees to the frame, and then do the pressure on, pressure off routine as before. Facing downhill is harder, since you will get very little back pressure. My tip here is to turn the front wheel to almost 90 degrees, and to let the bike roll so you are perpendicular to the direction of the road. Then you can generate a small amount of back pressure, since the bike actually tries to go back on itself. Be careful though, it is very easy to fall off doing this. And when you have mastered this, you can try doing it while still in the saddle ;-) 

Effectively what you are doing when you stand on the pedals and rock the bike from side to side is lowering the crank length and reducing the gear ratio. You are also using a lot of energy to hold the bike stable while you change from side to side & as well as wasting energy through the extra flexing of the frame, cranks & pedals. The only situations that really warrant getting out of the saddle is to either give your muscles a chance to rest by using a slightly different set or to accelerate very quickly, such as coming out of a corner in a race. 

Most people would agree that at the point you have a new frame, you have new bicycle. In that sense your question might be rephrased: "how can I purchase new bicycle and minimize cost by using some of parts from the old one". To do so, you need to make a list of parts that you think are good on the old one, including type of parts and assessment of their value. Then you go to shop some other old bicycle that has bad or lacking parts that you have. In theory this sounds good, but in practice it takes a lot of time and looking of old bicycles to find suitable purchase candidate. That is because you need new bicycle that will be compatible with parts you have. For instance if you have good 6 speed shifter, you should be looking for bicycle with 6 speed rear hub. It is not a rocket science, but there is some room to make mistakes, and in the end spend more money that you have intended to. But it is definitely a learning experience! 

I would like to purchase this hub, rim and suitable spokes, but I am not able to find dimensions of this hub necessary to calculate spoke size. I have checked usual places where such information can be found, but without success. Does anyone own this hub, and has taken its measures? 

Head tube angle is one of 3 factors that together determine bicycle tendency to stay in the same direction. The other two are wheel size and fork rake, and with head tube angle they give value named trail . Bicycles with larger trail tend to be stable and hold direction, while bicycles with smaller trail react faster and with smaller input. Given the wheel size and same fork rake, smaller head tube angle will give larger trail. While most of the bicycles with smaller head tube angels tend to have matching forks such that they have larger trail, true answer can be found only by inspecting all elements. Or even better by trying out the bicycle. 

I heard recently that Simon Gerrans of the new Green Edge cycling team had won one of the monuments. What are these races? 

One problem that is rather rare is that the caps can add to the weight of the valve and contribute to wheel wobble when going at very high speeds (> 80km/hr) 

Time has come to refresh the wardrobe a little, and the old woollen cycling jerseys need some young blood to compete against. What should I be looking for in a modern cycling top? Is lycra used anymore? Does the cut of the jersey (other than being tight) have any effect? 

I usually make sure I have my cycling mittens on. I also put enough air into the tube so that I can push the tube inside of the tyre and in place on the rim all the way around. I then use my hands to put the tyre bead on the rim, rolling on left side and then the right side, starting at the valve and working to the opposite point. I also try to use the flesh on the base of my thumbs to do the hard rolling work. As I get close to having the complete tyre on, I let a little bit of air out of the tube, so that you release the pressure on the bead enough to get the last part on with your hands. In the really tight cases, I use just a single tyre lever just to the left of the furthest point to get the tyre moving in and then use my thumb for the very last "push". Since you has the tube inflated enough at the start to position it inside the tyre, you should find that you avoid pinching the tube. Then inflate the tube just a little bit more, and go around looking at the inside of the rim and tyre join, looking to see if the tube is pinched by the tyre. The pressure needs to be low enough to be easy to push the tyre in as you go around by high enough to give the tyre some solid shape. When you get confident enough about putting the tyre on, you can skip the slow check and just pump the wheel up to full pressure. Then look on both sides of the wheel at the line on the tyre just above the rim. This should be a nice and even distance from the rim, all the way around. If it goes towards the rim or away from the rim in any spot then you have a pinch and you need to let the pressure out the wheel pronto, before she blows!
