In the long run, the US either finds a way to generate jobs for these people, or it will lose importance as an economic superpower. However, in the short run, the effect on low-income workers are not that great, and the gains for the overall economy, which may or may not trickle down to the low-income workers, aren't quite as amazing, either. 

tl;dr Influenced by? Yes. Mainly/truly/only based on? Nope. Islam did not miraculously pop into existence (ok, to some extent it may have), but it was heavily influenced by pre-existing religions. This includes the name of Allah (Muhammad's Father's name includes Abd Allah, servant of god), which was the name of one of the deities worshipped in Mecca, and which is etymologically related to Elohim (one of the names of the old testament god) according to the OED. The moon symbol also predates Islam, though its use on flags has only been traced back to the 12th century, and it was also associated with the Mithras cult, a variant of which is also known for its similarities to Christianity (link to a site that suggests Christianity is basically Mithraidism with a new name). Importantly, the moon was not a symbol of early Islam. Thus, the claim that Islam is based mainly on a moon worshipping cult becomes difficult to defend, unless one would assume that the most holy symbol of the religion was somehow kept secret from everybody else for several hundred years. While it will be difficult to deny that Islam was influenced by the prevailing thoughts and religions of the time, it is wrong to claim that "in reality", Islam is a pagan religion. The reality of religions are based the beliefs of the adherents, and if Muslims believe that theirs is fundamentally an Abrahamic religion, then that's their reality. Using the history of religion to make claims about the "validity" is just trolling. Two more links for your reading pleasure (ok, only the second is a pleasant read): 

A guy named Shawn Carlson conducted a study, published in Nature on December 5, 1985. Unfortunately, that link is a paywall. There's a description available, unfortunately not as authoritative. Essentially, he let astrologers test themselves, by setting up a test where they would use natal charts to predict peoples' scores on standardized personality tests. He picked thirty astrologers that were considered good by their peers. He appears to have given astrologers every chance to prove themselves right. As people reading this might guess, the results were indistinguishable from chance. 

In US and Canadian major sports, this site shows some comparative figures (the site explains where its figures come from). In baseball, hockey, and football, the home team wins about 55% of the time. The advantage is larger for basketball, about 60%. The site does some speculation on why the larger advantage, for those interested. All information is from the highest-level professional leagues. This site refers to setting up noisy fans (human sports enthusiasts) in the right place for Minnesota Vikings games in the Metrodome. This is a local newspaper article (can't find a link to the original) about manipulation of the fans (the mechanical air-movers) to give Twins hitters an advantage. I can't find a newspaper article from late 1987, but somebody conducted a study of fan noise by time in that World Series. They found that the Twins fans actually fell reasonably quiet when the one of the Cardinals hit the ball, and got noisier when one of the Twins did. The stadium was very loud, so Twins fielders got a certain hush to do their job in, while the Cardinals had to perform in much louder situations. The conclusion was that this likely helped the Twins. 

There were US officers that expected a Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor, but they were generally low-ranking officers, and you can typically find low-ranking officers who will believe anything. (Gordon Prange, At Dawn We Slept). The best account I've found of exactly what went on is Lee & Clausen's Pearl Harbor: the Final Judgment. There are so many conspiracy theories that it is hard to refute them all in one book, but reading a few good books on the subject will be useful. One thing that most conspiracy theorists ignore is that the US Army and US Navy sent messages to Pearl Harbor ordering preparation for imminent war ten days before the Japanese attack. It seems to me that, if you warn somebody of an impending attack, there's always the possibility they'll do something about it. Another fallacy that is sometimes used is the confusion of US officials expecting imminent war (which they did) with US officials expecting an attack on Pearl Harbor (which they didn't). The second question is covered thoroughly in Feis' Road to Pearl Harbor (I haven't found a better source yet). In brief, Roosevelt was dragging his heels on sanctions and the like against Japan, in the hope that the US could stay at peace with Japan. (Roosevelt wanted to get into a war with Germany, and in September 1941 ordered the US Navy to fight the war in the Atlantic (Morison, The Battle of the Atlantic). Roosevelt was advised that the materials sent to Japan would delay US rearmament, and allowed them to be shipped anyway. The tl;dr version of the above: No high US official expected an attack on Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt was taking measures to not provoke Japan, in the hopes that he could avoid that war. 

First of all, bacteria-free doesn't really exist. For example it is estimated that a human contains about ten times as many bacterial cells as there are human cells. I'd be extremely surprised if that wasn't also true for other animals. So why worry about cleanliness then? Chicken meat can carry disease-causing bacteria, including salmonella, which infects chicken as well as humans. In addition, there are plenty of problematic bacteria in feces (E.coli comes to mind), and if the chicken aren't reared in very good hygienic condition, it is possible that contamination happens during the slaughter. Note that if you handle chicken meat properly - don't undercook the meat, don't lick your fingers after touching the meat, don't re-use the knife to spread peanut butter without washing it first etc -, the chances of infecting yourself with salmonella or other bacteria is very low. A farmer rearing a small number of chickens and taking good care of them will have an easier time spotting an infected chicken, and manual slaughtering/defeathering chickens is less likely to lead to contamination of meat with feces (depending, of course, on where you do it. In the open air next to a pile of cow dung is not ideal). Feed has not much do do with this, though, as long as the chicken don't eat their own feces. As to the chlorine bath: Yes, that is apparently true. In fact, it appears the the EU prohibited import of chicken from the US due to the chlorine treatments. 

There have been deaths following chickenpox vaccination, though the rate of death is 10-fold smaller than for chickenpox itself (0.15 in 100,000 vaccinations), and whenever an autopsy has been performed, it was found that the cause of death was from wild-type chickenpox virus, rather than from the vaccine, and that the patient had undiagnosed cancer or other complications (source: Wise RP, Salive ME, Braun MM, et al. (2000). "Postlicensure safety surveillance for varicella vaccine". JAMA 284 (10): 1271â€“9.; make sure to read the reports in Box 1) 

The Mayo Clinic page on retinal detachment does not list either trains or reading as causes, and the closest it comes to reading on a vehicle for risk factors is "Previous severe eye injury or trauma", which you don't get without something bad happening to the vehicle. 

I found some information on Chizhevsky's work at a Cycles Research Institute site, and downloaded his Physical Factors of the Historical Process. I wasn't impressed. He picked out historical events and attempted to match them with sunspot cycles. The means by which he picked them out isn't obvious, and the assignment of exact dates is frequently arbitrary. Since this is matched against time periods of a few years each (the usual 11-year cycle is divided into four sections), there are certainly possibilities of cherry-picking here, and no information on how that was guarded against, and if it was. There is a list of cholera epidemics, and no mention of other diseases. The cycles for most of his period of study are measured nine to a century, with only moderate attempts to account for the actual cycles. The attempt to break WWI down by sunspot cycles seems forced. Having read several books about it, I wouldn't have guessed 1915 as the period of greatest violence, although he claims that as a peak of violence. There was a lot of fighting against Russia that year, although less than in 1916's Brusilov offensive, and not a whole lot in France and Belgium, particularly compared to 1916's Verdun and Somme battles. He attributes the 1917 Russian Revolution to another outburst of sunspots, but overall the fighting had abated some since 1916, with the Russian and French armies seriously demoralized and incapable of large offensives. The article that you linked was sensationalistic, and tied the maxima of 1990 to the Kuwait wars and 2001 to one (admittedly large) act of terrorism and two invasions (one in 2003), ignoring other cycle points. Counting back from 1990 by elevens, we get 1979, which was fairly quiet, 1968, when the Vietnam War was about to wind down but still raging (like the Tet Offensive), 1957, a fairly quiet year over most of the globe, and 1946, when very little of military consequence happened, as the world tried to recover from WWII. It seems to me that any major disturbances should show up more clearly in crime rates, but I saw nothing about crime rates in a quick look at the CRI site, and I've never heard of an eleven-year cycle there. In short, I have failed to see appropriate evidence for the claim. 

Interestingly enough, they find that while wages in the directly affected industries are stable, wages of other low-income jobs decrease, because companies lay off the less critical workers first, who then have to find something else in a different sector. Thus, at least in the short to medium term, life gets worse for the majority of low-income workers when people are laid off, even those who weren't working in the affected industries. The study cannot differentiate whether the job losses are due to companies shifting manufacturing overseas, or whether they are due to Chinese companies simply outcompeting US companies, but for the purpose of the article in the OP, the US should be benefitting in both cases. Along with the increase in unemployment, there is a rise in disability benefits, since people who may otherwise prefer to hold a job fall back onto whatever is available to keep them afloat. Since these benefits ultimately have to be paid via taxes, the authors of the study can estimate roughly how much the US is spending vs gaining from imports from China, and they come to the surprising conclusion that 

This has recently been supported by Egholm et al. (2009). Glacial effects limiting mountain height. Nature 460:884, who do a more large-scale analysis. The abstract of this paper which summarizes the above much better than I do: 

In summary, if we can use workplace accidents as indicators of overall concentration levels of workers and consequently manufacturing quality, the data suggest that there is overall little difference between weekdays, with Mondays and Fridays generally being best. How come? It may just turn out that most workers don't get totally wasted on the week-end, but actually relax, and that on Friday, the prospect of relaxing on the week-end makes people happier and thus more motivated to do a good job. 

Summary: Chickenpox as a disease results in 2 deaths per 100,000 cases, and about 2,000 per 100,000 cases of complications. Chickenpox vaccine results in ~0.15 deaths per 100,000 cases (most of which turn out to be due to natural varicella, so the true death rate is lower), and about 67.5 per 100,000 cases of complications. Thus, for children, vaccination is safer than pox parties. However, dormant chickenpox virus from both vaccination or natural infection can cause shingles later in life if the immunity fades, and chickenpox re-exposure helps boost immunity. Thus, for adults who have had chickenpox or chickenpox vaccination, pox parties may have some benefit (though they would get a similar benefit from re-vaccination). Chickenpox is a usually mild infection, and children between 1 and 14 who get it, and who don't have troubles with the immune system, have cancer, or are taking steroids, have an excellent prognosis (source: Medscape) 

This solar storms site (no opinion of its reliability) says that sunspots caused radio problems in 1943 in the invasion of Italy (not enough detail to tell whether they're talking about Sicily or Salerno), which would be close enough for a wargames convention bar. 

I did a quick Google search. There is a 2007 snopes.com article about it, claiming that while there definitely is brightly colored meth, nobody official verifies the flavor, and there is no evidence it's intended for young children. This ABC News article from 2007 provides testimony from a former meth user that meth can be flavored, but that drug rehabilitation centers in three states reported no reports of such meth. The idea that it was intended for young children is attributed to a law enforcement official, but no actual evidence is provided. Looking at more articles, I find a complete lack of evidence, although a lot of suspicion, that the fancy drugs are marketed to young children. I found one case of a teenager using something like strawberry meth, but it's unclear to me if the teenager started on it. Newspapers tend to present evidence if they have it, and I'm not finding it. I think that, if any drug dealer had been caught trying to sell this stuff to a young child, there'd be a mention in one of the articles. It's clear that colored and flavored meth exists, but the idea that it's targetted at young children seems speculative at best. 

I found a web site that claimed he had a plan to extract energy from the heat in the air. This is a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that you can only derive heat energy from a difference in temperature. This site mentions cosmic rays, and then suggests that a sufficiently high wire could bridge a potential difference between the ground and the air, thereby charging a capacitor that could be tapped for power. This could actually work, as there are often potential differences (when they get large enough, we get lightning). Whether there would be enough usable energy to make it worthwhile is another question (and a large enough potential difference would zap right through the capacitor anyway).
