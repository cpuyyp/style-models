How can I sum, for example, LAUDOS_EXPEDIDOS1 + LAUDOS_EXPEDIDOS2 Into a 4ยบ column? like this: I'm pretty sure it's something really easy. I'm trying to use sum with the aliases, with no success. 

We are implementing Zabbix, monitoring a lot of processes. But I think it would be great to monitor the SQL service ( if it's running, stopped...) 

I could fix this by running the query pointing to a driver inside the server I'm running. How can I give permissions to a SQL Login/User to a network folder? Should I map the driver first and then run it? Like the tip they have in this site: $URL$ I'm trying it right now. Question: Is my BCP running under SQL Service Account ? or it's using the -U -P account? 

How can I make the second column ('0.995014168') To have more decimals? I'm trying to convert to , even using with no success. 

You have maintenance plans. Try to follow these steps: Find the maintenance plan name and id that you want to delete. Write down the id of the one you want to delete. 

When I righ click the job + view history, I can only see 2 days of logs. I'm sure this is a really noob question but I can't find the answer. 

is there a way to make this query, a unique query? and, is there a way to name these columns? because I know I need to alias them, but they stay with that (no column name) above it. 

Try to use . Theres a column where you can see the Complete_percentage of a SPID/process. You will not find problems by killing or stoping a clustered index creation, the problem is, you will need to wait for the RollBack proccess ( if you are waiting hours for the creation, the rollback will take hours too ). 

What are you trying to achieve with more than two axes? If at the end you just want those fields/values to be dumped into a tabular result, you can rewrite your query to use crossjoins. 

You cannot use an aggregate like CountRows() in a calculated field in your dataset. But you can use CountRows() as an expression in a textbox (alone or within a table) scoped to your dataset. Now that you have your dataset created, you can put a textbox on the report and populate it with the expression , and it will provide the correct answer. Otherwise, you will need to modify your dataset to include the rowcount. It would seem that using the expression in the report would be the desired option as modiying the dataset would give you a column populated with either a running total or the total rows repeated on each column. 

You can back up and restore SSAS Tabular 2012 databases, but you will have to adjust the security role memberships to include users in the correct domain. You can perform the backup and restore manually or through a script in Management Studio (or executed via PowerShell). You can also re-deploy an SSAS database from the SSDT project or using the SSAS Deployment wizard. The wizard will allow you to deploy roles and ignore members. Next populate the role memberships with appropriate users. From there, you can process the model to populate it and bring the model online. Another option is to script the SSAS database from Management Studio. Once you do this you can remove the collection from each role and execute the XMLA on your target server. 

This is commonly represented with an accumulating snapshot fact table or timestamped accumulating snapshot fact table. Accumulating snapshot tables model events in progress for business processes that involve a predefined series of steps. The timestamped. You'll have a date key in the table that represents the date the opportunity hit each stage. If you need to reproduce what pipeline looked like on a given day or track the fact that an opportunity went into and out of a stage multiple times, you might need to consider the timestamped accumulating snapshot. 

According to one of the Microsoft's support pages, there is this query to show if there are gaps between logs. there are none: 

Has anyone seen this? I have no idea what is this error. When we Schedule a task to send an e-mail with report server, it shows me this error in error log. There are a lot of websites saying it is a SQL 2005 BUG. But I can't find nothing to help me with SQL Server 2008 R2. EDIT 1 Digging a little more...I could find this: 

Whats happening is, the primary backup job is running fine ( there is a lot more history, im just showing the last 2 ). 

i'm trying to update a remote table using linked server, based on id of my local table. I'm trying this: 

I've been changing values but with no success. The same config I have in this server, I have in other servers. 

A simple trace with . But, how can I know the query that has the problem listed here? I don't think is appropriated to this. EDIT 1: Well, I'm using: STORED PROCEDURES: 

If I don't get calls, I just drop the database. Just make a backup of the database and save it for x months. EDIT1: You can kill all connections of a database with this: 

I'm having some headaches with a procedure. Long story short, I'm using now a hint to force an index ( now, the query runs in 0.1 secs, after this, it was running in 2min ) but the question is, why is it using Parallelism, if it is set to 0? 

Maybe this question is a little off topic, I will close if necessary, but, is there a way to configure Management studio, to when I open it, it starts already with x connections? So I don't need to start it and connect to x instances every time. 

Since I can't see your table structure and I don't know the size of your data, here's something that will return the right answer but may or may not need to be tweaked for performance. You can write a query that groups both created and closed tickets together by date. Although you could just write two queries and do a full outer join, I would guess you want SSRS to accurately represent days with no ticket activity in addition to filtering the data for the date range at the source instead of in the presentation layer, so I would suggest creating a date table/CTE/query. If you already have a date table, use it. If not, here is a way to create what you need for the last 30 days. You could also make it a stored procedure and parameterize it to choose the number of days. 

If you are browsing in Excel and want to be able to see dimension attribute members that do not have corresponding rows in a fact table (measure returns nothing), there is a pivot table setting you can use. Access the PivotTable Options dialog box by right clicking on the pivot table and choosing PivotTable Options. On the Display tab, check the box next to Show items with no data on rows. This will show all values of whatever hierarchy is in your rows regardless of if the measure in the Values section of your pivot table returns a non-blank result. You can do the same thing for columns by checking the item underneath the one indicated in the image. This option must be set for each pivot table and will apply to all fields in the rows (or columns) when you check the box. 

This will give you the desired answer based upon the example data you provided. You didn't answer my question about the number of levels, so this assumes there are no more than 3 levels. 

About recovery modes, I know that if you want point in time recovery, we should use FULL recovery mode. if this is not necessary, you can use SIMPLE recovery mode. But, I read about Simple recovery mode, and it says that we should use this if point in time recovery is not important . Here we don't need LOG backups, we only use , and I thought that should be good for performance and disk space to use Simple recovery databases. But As I said, we don't have static data. there's a lot of insert, updates and development updates ( yes I don't understand why they don't need point in time recovery , but, anyway...). My question is, is still a good Idea to use simple recovery, or by not having static data, the log will still grow, and etc? 

Then, I want to use the inside a loop, to list all indexes of this table ( TB_INF_CLI ) of all these databases, with this query: 

But, this is for a test purpose, because I was trying to create a temp table inside the procedure like this: 

as said here ( **How to be sure that a SQL Script is running with ANSI encoding? ) **this is not correct. But, is there a way to use something like this? 

is configured this way: LSBACKUP_MyDatabase - every 25min : LSCOPY_MyDatabase - every 1 minute LSRESTORE_MyDatabase - every 10 minutes 

The reason I'm asking this question is because I read every other question about mirroring here, but none of them could help me. 

Please, if this is not place to post questions like these, let me know and I will delete it. Inside the Glenn berry's Diagnostic queries, there is a query to show how much CPU a database is using. This is the query: 

You can put your cube formula in a separate cell and reference the cell where users type in the name they want. For example, if you have users put the branch name in cell B2, you can put this formula in another cell. 

The validity depends on how users want to look at the data. You are looking at it as just a transaction fact. Other types of fact tables include periodic snapshots and accumulating snapshots. If you want to see all the times that someone corrected a row to help decrease erroneous entries, the effective dates may be appropriate so it's clear that the transaction was updated. This creates a fact table that is somewhat similar to a type 2 SCD. The Kimball Group has an article that directly addresses your question. Here's a Kimball Group design tip that talks about effective dated accumulating snpashot fact tables. You may be correct that you should just add transactions that reverse the original row. That sounds like it could be a valid solution if you just need to see the transactions and sum them up. This is how I've seen most accounting data work. Kimball says the effective dated fact tables may be useful for quickly calculating account balances at a paritcular point in time, especially for tracking slowly changing balances. But this is a fairly rare case. I think your concern that it will be confusing for users is also valid. You have to decide if that can be overcome by education and if its worth it for the added analytical capabilites in the data. I haven't had to do this much in my data warehousing experience because most of my facts were simple transactions or periodic snapshots. But I have created several effective dated bridge tables for many-to-many relationships. 

I'm thinking in something like execute sql, But Im having problems with files with spaces in name ( jhon vacation.mp3 ) for example. Any Ideas? Edit2: Query done, now I need to fix the Spaces in files name. 

We are creating scripts to sent to our customers, with some inserts. We save them with ANSI encoding on NOTEPAD++, but when the customer runs the script via SQL*PLUS, it looks like this: 

One thing that I noticed was the wait type Is there a way to verify if the disk has a problem, but via SQL SERVER? Oh, and when I pause the script, I got this message: 

When you drop a table, it will free the space in the database, but not back to the O.S. because your database has this space allocated. You need to shrink your database. but it's not a good Idea, because it's good to have free space in the database , so it can grow without the need to ask the o.s. to grow your file and then use it. this can cause fragmentation. 

I'm using 1433 because a long story. but its working. We can use the default port 1433 AND IPAII ( for PHP developers ) with 1433 too. But in production, when I changed, the server lost connection. There's no way to explain this in a easy way. Why I had no problems on one servers, but on another, it lost connection? If the question is to abroad, I can get it better. 

But the restore never completes. using the complete_percentage is null ( for like, 10 minutes ). In my own machine, I could restore the database, this is my server: 

Maybe this question is confusing to understand ( as I'm not fluent in English ) but, I need to select for example, but this needs to have the following rule: Part 1: it needs to be ALL cods, except for . Part2: Another column, with another , but only with cod 21. it's not the entire query, But after this, I think I can do it. I tried this:
