Anger is one of the Buddhist "poisons", and is a source or cause of "suffering", and a large part of the point of Buddhism is to liberate yourself from such, not be susceptible to it. The "wholesome behaviours" which are opposite to anger include non-aggression or non-hatred, and benevolence or kindness. Not becoming angry might take repeated practice. There are views (about the world and about self) which are or are not conducive to becoming angry. There's awareness (of your body and reactions), etc. It can be a deep and complicated subject. @andy256 answered it pretty well. I worried about some of the other answers: e.g. "thinking of the driver as an idiot", or that there's "not much you can do to prevent your visceral response", might not be ideal answers. Imagine a person who never gets angry! 

Bacteria take a bit of time to grow/multiply. So maybe it doesn't matter much how much you sweat, and what matters more is how long it's been since your last shower. So my strategy is: 

I'd like to understand more about how the design of a bike affects its speed (assume a normal, two-wheeled bike with gears). 

When I stop for a pedestrian at a crossing, I may hold my hand across the lane to stop cyclists behind me. Signalling to others is probably legal IMO. If I'm driving I'd like to take responsibility for my own conduct, and not drive into anyone no matter who or how anyone might signal at me. Every road I've driven on has clear right-of-ways, traffic lights, stops signs. US law includes the notion of contributory negligence which may apply. 

I read that too. I eventually bought an Alu bike with no suspension (and no 'carbon seat post', etc.). I'm riding on paved roads: not hopping or flying or dropping; when coasting over (small) pot-holes and frost-crazed pavement I just stand / lift myself slightly: put more of my weight on my feet/pedals and less on my seat/saddle. Advantages are Alu are a) lighter b) doesn't rust c) just as strong. Advantages of no suspension include a) lighter b) cheaper c) more efficient and less maintenance. 

To experiment with physical properties like vibration, I'll guess they use full-scale prototypes, made of actual metal: identical to the finished mass-manufactured article, except hand-made one-offs instead of mass-produced. You might be able to get by with a scale model (e.g. quarter-size), so long as it's made from a sufficiently similar material (e.g. welded steel). Using anything else (e.g. LEGO blocks or balsa wood) would not, I guess, be a useful prototype, because its mechanical properties are too dissimilar. Another possibility might be a computer model. On the other hand (as an example of a different problem being able to use a different kind of prototype) if you were trying to model the wind resistance instead of the vibration: because a thing's interaction with the air depends on its external/superficial shape, more than on mechanical properties like stiffness, for that you could use a different material. In his autobiography, Freeman Dyson asserted that the reason why motorcycles are reliable is because there have been so many different generations of them since they were invented, with each new one building on and correcting the problems with the previous versions (he contrasted that with nuclear power stations, saying that there haven't been 100s of generations of those). 

It took me a few months of everyday riding before I was willing to leave the right shoulder across multiple lanes to turn left, as suggested by Daniel's answer. Walk across: you can afford to. You're not being "a bit lame": you're being generous and friendly to your less experienced friend. If you want to shout about dawdling then you're less relaxed that you'd like to be yourself. Discuss it before-hand rather than during traffic. Maybe do some interval training with/against your friend out of traffic (ride along together and then ... OK! Sprint! Go!) to practice ... to practice changing gears for example, and for you each to learn how fast the other can go, to have shared understanding and realistic expectations (you may be thinking: "There's a gap in the traffic: I'm fast enough to merge into that interval" ... you need to know for sure whether your friend is too, and more importantly your friend needs to know too). 

I have the same problem as a pedestrian. They inhabit a tiny portion of my route (trees near a cycle path near water): I just slow down a bit there as I arrive, and move on quickly as I leave, and I always wear eye protection. I guess that the cause is territorial behaviour, defending a nest: so don't take it personally, and I don't think it's anything to do with the colours you wear. 

Over-engineer it (make it stronger than necessary) Trial and error (fix it if it breaks) It's better to fail slowly/gracefully than catastrophically/dangerously (e.g. better to blow a tire or break a spoke than to collapse a wheel). 

What actual problem are you trying to solve, or what experiment are you trying to perform, what question are you trying to answer, by making a prototype? E.g. architectural models may try to solve problems like, "What will it look like?" and "Is there enough space for the plumbing?" However models, which have a different size and are made of different materials than the finished product, don't necessarily model/simulate the physical performance/behviour of the finished product (e.g. vibrations). 

I general I assume that drivers are looking forward (out of their windscreen) but never assume that they're looking out their side window. Also if I'm coming to an intersection where I have right of way (the other driver has a stop sign) then I watch for eye contact with the driver: if I have seen that they have seen me then I'm willing to cycle across their bow, otherwise (e.g. if they're looking in another direction) I might slow down, in case they pull out without having seen me, until they do look at me. I'll try to stay out of the way (preferring roads which have an official bike lane, or a road that's wide enough for me to ride in the curb) where cars can overtake me safely. If cars can't overtake me safely (because the road is too narrow) then I take the lane in order to prevent cars from even trying to overtake. I also try to ride fast enough that my doing this doesn't annoy drivers. I can't match their top speed but my acceleration (in congested city driving) is comparable. If the rate of flow of traffic on a given street is limited by the buses or streetcars then I can keep up with (even overtake) them, so even when I'm in lane I'm not 'getting in the way' of drivers (because I'm keeping up with the vehicle ahead of me). I use lights at night, and hand-signals before turning (and, sometimes, when slowing). I keep an ear out for traffic (and I avoid, e.g. by pulling into the curb/kerb, people who are gunning their engines). Obviously I watch what's ahead but (moreso than when driving a car) I watch for what's behind and beside me. I have excellent brakes (hydraulic disk brakes) and I'm willing to use them. I avoid roads on which bikes are unexpected (e.g. a type of multi-lane city throughway whose top speed is 60 kph instead of the more usual 50 kph). 

I've used a Pinhead lock to lock my wheels, while parked on the side-walk for the last few months, and it hasn't been stolen yet. 

Something like the Bontrager Interchange Market Pannier might suit you: it's a clip-on/clip-off pannier which can double as a backpack. Bontrager have other models available. I use an older model of their 'City Grocery Bag' or something like that: which has a carrying handle, but not backpack straps. To use it you need a rear rack on the bike, which it clips onto. 

You asked about accessories and not the bike; ideally (because a good bike is more fun) your bike is of a kind that's worth servicing, and has been serviced recently: so the wheels spin freely, the brakes work well, the chain is newish, the seat and everything fit you, and the gears if any. 

I don't know how to prep in 6 days. If you're a "very experience rider in great shape" then you sound already prepared. I don't really want to post except that Criggie's answer sounds to me like a big jump (from about 5 or 15, up to 66); a smaller jump might be less worrying. My current routine is: 

I think that in English a 'pannier' usually refers to something hung next to the wheels, whereas a 'basket' is hung on the front. But in another language i.e. French a 'panier' is rather a basket, or perhaps a rack. 

With really good tires you might not need suspension at all. I put Marathon Plus tires on a hard-tail for commuting, and find that the heavier tire gives me confidence and suspension to ride harder than before over broken pavement. 

I'm nervous about hand signalling (taking a hand off the handle bar) while I'm decelerating: I'm worried that my body being pushed forward will act on the one remaining hand and change the angle of the front wheel. So I'm sometimes not signalling as much as I'd like to (e.g. while I'm decelerating): as much as I would in a car. Is this a known problem? Is there a work-around or solution? This is for riding in city traffic. For example on a main road, relatively fast with cars following, I want to slow down before turning off onto a side street. 

What about ladies bikes? I tried to buy one recently, like mine but with a smaller frame. It came with 700 wheels. Is that sensible? Shouldn't there be a smaller wheel for a smaller frame? Does North America versus Europe make a difference re. which non-700 wheel size to expect? The LBS said that frames with/for small wheels were the "mountain bikes". When we bought this ladies bike we wanted it like my other bike, which I like, but smaller: so an aluminium frame with no suspension, and disc brakes; and added a rack, and fenders, an optional pannier ... and a heavy ("Kryptonite New York") D-lock (I use my bike for year-round commuting). I also got Marathon Plus tires, hoping they'd never flat. Though she could lift the bike on the show-room floor (and when we rented it for a week-end test ride) before they installed those accessories, now that it's heavier she's not comfortable lifting it up and down stairs. What solution? Not for this bike necessarily, but in general: what bike has features and accessories but is proportionally smaller and lighter? Are there specific accessories which may be part of the solution, e.g. by being especially lightweight or removable yet well-made? This isn't for racing. It's for riding to and around the local parks, and residential roads. Along roads to the park. For shopping. Along flat bike trails next to waterways. Possibly through town or city traffic. Some light-weight bikes are racers, aren't they. But racers are not an ideal ladies bike, I expect. What if a lady has limited upper body strength: I expect (I haven't tried them) that racing drop bars aren't ideal, and complicate learning to brake and shift gears (kindly consider a novice lady rider if you answer this question). Also on a racer, the gearing would be wrong for a novice city/recreational rider. When I say "lady" I mean adult (possible senior) female, wearing pants (trousers) or shorts, height around 5'4" (160 cm) or less, paved roads and paths, non-competitive, novice (and consequently not athletic). I'd like her to ride an hour and enjoy it (assuming e.g. she already does 45 minutes on an indoor bike each day, and swims and walks etc.), and carry it up or down a flight of stairs single-handed, or put it into the back of a van, or onto a rack on front of a bus. Summary: 

There's some cooperation with rail. There's a railway system that brings commuters from nearby towns and suburbs into the city. The most important, central station is in the downtown core. One of the more recent bits of bike infrastructure is a bike storage room in the central rail station, intended presumably to let commuters store their bikes there: to live outside the city, take the (crowded during rush-hour) train without their bikes, and to have their bikes when they arrive (to get from the station to wherever they work). As for public transport within Toronto, you're not allowed to take a bike on the subway during rush-hour; but the buses (all the buses, I think) have convenient bike racks. (See also bike paths, mentioned above). 

I ride in the conditions you describe (Toronto: not rainy now but it has been), except that my commute is 11 miles (18 km), and except that I don't change in the office (I wear what I bike and arrive in: people wear jeans and slacks in the office, it's not customer-facing). I started this time last year, in jeans (Levi's). I found I did better with knee bandages worn underneath (my knees were weak), especially when "sub-zero" (i.e. below freezing, 32F). The seats of my jeans wore through quickly. I then wore cotton shorts all summer and autumn. Since this fall (and into winter and now) I have been wearing two kinds of Rapha trousers (link and link). Features include: 

If it appeared immediately after a repair then the following probably isn't the right diagnosis, but the symptoms sound like "Indexed Steering" ("Brinelling") described on this page. 

Try some other gloves in a store, to see what size fits you on average. E.g. in a shirt I'm a medium or a large. However I bought my gloves in a store, after looking at the whole range on display, and trying on a few of them for feel. They 'fit me like a glove'. When I was looking for winter gloves (with full-length fingers and an inner lining, which are more difficult to fit that finger-less gloves are), in an outdoor sports store with a cycling-clothing department, I found a great variation in the quality of the design, and in the quality of the manufacturing (i.e. the stitching). Most I tried were not comfortable. I chose the best for me. 

I usually can't detect my punctures except using water. When I use water I discover that the puncture is tiny. The bad thing about water is that you can't easily use that method in the field or on the road; and the good thing about tiny punctures is that you can wait until you get home. Symptoms of a tiny puncture are: 

Maybe there's a "slow flat"? If you have a little pin-prick protruding through the tire, it will put a tiny hole in the inner tube, and the tube will go flat faster than expected (e.g. overnight). To check: 

I don't know that it's good, nor even possible, to 'train' when you're 'exhausted'? So, why are you exhausted, and how to avoid it: perhaps you need to rehydrate or to refuel, perhaps on the fly; or perhaps your 'normal speed' for the first hour needs to be slower/easier (even for the fittest, the 'normal speed' for a sprint isn't the same as for a marathon). Apparently a 180 lb cyclist at 12 mph (on the flat, presumably) burns about 500 calories/hour. FWIW I've been cycling for a bit over an hour twice a day, 3-5 days/week for the last month (after eating, so I don't run out of fuel on the way). And I haven't been pushing myself too hard (e.g. I'm using low gears when I get to a hill) because I don't want to strain my knees: and I'm sure I'm getting stronger/more enduring. If strength is about increasing muscle, perhaps endurance is about increasing vascularisation. Apparently when you exercise your "VO2max" i.e. the rate at which you can burn/use/take in oxygen increases, and that's partly because you get more capillaries (I imagine, I don't know, that it's blood vessels that were previously too small to be effective that increase to meet the demand ... perhaps it's new vessels too); maybe that (growth and change in tissues) can't happen overnight. 

MEC advise, on their web site, that the cheapest way to keep your shoes dry is a plastic bag. They also sell shoe covers: some for rain and some (with neoprene and microfleece) for winter. 

For temperatures up to about +5 Celsius or so, I use a jacket (waterproof and/or lined and/or just fleecy): with a zipper down the front. When I get warm, I more or less undo the zipper (keeping it shut at the bottom to stop it flapping). Undoing the zipper spills a lot of heat from my core (body). Keeping the zipper done up (to my throat) keeps a lot of heat in (especially when it's a long-sleeved jacket). Being able to keep a lot of heat in, and/or being able to spill a lot of heat, means that I have a lot of control over how much I keep or shed, just by positioning the one zipper higher or lower. 

It is therefore (allegedly, more or less) waterproof but at the same time 'breathable'. Sometimes (as in my jacket) you don't see Gore-Tex. It's a middle layer, sewn in between the jacket's inner lining and outer shell. These other layers (i.e. the inner lining and the outer shell) are, principally, meant to be durable. They're woven, and have pockets etc. They also (being a water-resistant nylon fabric themselves) help to keep the sewn-in Gore-Tex from getting soaked: a sheet of water on the Gore-Tex would prevent its 'breathing'. In rain the Gore-Tex middle layer keeps the jacket's wet outer shell away from the inner lining and from my skin. In extremis (when all is soaked in very heavy rain) the Gore-Tex tries to stay water-repellent albeit no longer so 'breathable' (but in very heavy rain, I'm happy enough to be warm: and to have air inside the jacket). I bought my jacket 10 or 15 years ago from MEC. Even if it is expensive (and it wasn't, especially - and I liked it so much that I bought duplicates as Christmas presents for my family, and they still wear theirs too), I'd consider whether it's durable and useful. My jacket does not have cycling-specific tailoring, so I can wear it anywhere/anytime when it's wet out. Also I (among other things) reckon I save $1,500/year in bus fare by commuting by bike: so amortizing that $1,500/year over two or more years can justify spending ('investing') the money, for buying a bike and clothes, and still come out ahead, relatively. Anyway. So my jacket has a lining etc., as well as the Gore-Tex membrane hidden away as a middle layer. The inner lining of this jacket is mesh/webbing, which helps the jacket to stand off from the body. This makes it durable, and the nylon exterior shell makes it wind-proof. I regulate my heat (when cycling) by using the front zipper: up around the throat, or down to open the chest, which ventilates the jacket. There's a velcro strap at the cuffs to regulate the ventilation of the arms (which is why I avoid wearing a jacket in summer). It used to be I think that Gore-Tex didn't manufacture clothes, but licensed the fabric to clothiers (e.g. my jacket was made and labelled and perhaps designed by Le Coq Sportif, who make sportswear). Now Gore-Tex seem to make and sell their own complete clothes? But other manfacturers presumably continue to license the fabric and use it. There's a Gore-Tex "Paclite" fabric or jacket now, which I don't think I've seen/felt. I guess that's a single-layer jacket. I don't know whether that's pure Gore-Tex or otherwise how it's bonded to the shell (how it performs). I think it's aimed at cyclists. I don't know how good it is for cold-weather riding (mine, because it's lined and wind-proof, is good). I'd like to find a good selection of jackets but I don't know where. Most LBS when I ask for Gore-Tex say "that's expensive" and don't stock it. I don't want to buy sight unseen because all the details matter. Gore-Tex is still a brand and a trademark (and a company). Its patent has expired. I don't know what competing/similar products/solutions/manufacturers there are.
