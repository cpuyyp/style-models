While I agree with all the other answers here that no satellite flare has any chance of being bright enough to damage eyes or instruments there are concerns about them wrecking observations. Wikipedia reports that Iridium flares can reach magnitude -8 or brighter (Venus can be -4, the full moon is -12) and that could certainly be bright enough that scattered light from it would drown out some dim star or galaxy that you were trying to observe. If the flare can be predicted then you can always shut off the detectors for a short period, but some flares come from out of control satellites that are tumbling unpredictably. 

It's spread out in time. If a source emits a 1W pule of energy lasting 1 second and the receiver is receding so fast that it is Doppler shifted to a frequency which means the power is just 0.5W, then the pulse will take 2seconds to arrive (since the end of it had further to travel). 

As has already been said, the major sources of change to Earth's orbit are interactions with other planets and passing stars. We're ruling out mass loss of the Sun, so the next consideration is probably tidal interactions between the Earth and Sun. This paper suggests that the Earth is receding from the Sun by about 15cm/yr for this reason. This is 150 km per million years, so over a trillion years or so, would move Earth quite a bit further from the Sun. The effect would reduce as the Earth got further away from the Sun, but I think it would always be slowly receding. I haven't done the calculation, but I'm not sure it would ever reach tidal lock -- the angular momentum of the Sun is too high. Independently of this, though, orbital energy and angular momentum would slowly be lost by gravitational radiation. This wikipedia page gives a formula $$t={\frac {5}{256}}\,{\frac {c^{5}}{G^{3}}}\,{\frac {r^{4}}{(m_{1}m_{2})(m_{1}+m_{2})}}.$$ for the time to collision ignoring tidal effects. We can plug in known values for the parameters $r = 1.5 \times 10^{11} m$, $c = 3\times 10^8 m/s$, $G = 6.7 \times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, $m_1 = 6\times 10^{24} kg$, $m_2 = 2 \times 10^{30} kg$ and get about $3.3\times 10^{30} s$ as the time to collision. I suspect that's the time until the centres of the Earth and Sun coincide, so the actual collision would be a bit earlier, but probably not enough to notice at this precision. So that's about 10 million million times the lifetime of the universe so far. I can't find enough information to work out how these two effects would interact. Clearly in the first $10^{12}$ years tidal evolution would be more important, but that conserves angular momentum and slows as the Suns rotation slows, whereas gravitational radiation actually carries angular momentum away, so might dominate in the long term. On the other hand the radiation drops as a high power of the separation, so we might have the Earth moving ever more slowly away from the Sun, while radiating gravitational waves of ever weaker strength, and never reaching tidal lock or starting to move back in. 

I just bought my first telescope - a Celestron CDC 1100. It came with a 40mm lens so with a primary focal length of 2800mm the power should be 70x. My problem is that I've looked at Sirius and Mars and they look clearer to my naked eye than with my telescope. I am able to focus from way out so I can see the 'blind spot' of the secondary mirror, go through 'focused' and then continue moving the mirror in the same direction until I again see the blind spot. So I know I'm focusing through when it should be 'good'. But, like I said, what I see is a relatively unfocused spot of light that is clearer and steadier with my naked eye. Admittedly, my 'seeing conditions' aren't very good since I am looking through my window in a suburban neighborhood where light pollution is pretty bad. That being said, I still see Mars and Sirius quite brightly - it's just that they never come into clear focus - nor are they any larger than when I look using my eyes. And when I move my eye around the eyepiece I see streaks of light in different directions originating from the target. There are many stars to be seen, though they are just pinpricks as I would expect given the seeing conditions. What I mean to say is that I cannot see all those stars with my naked eye but can see tens or hundreds more looking through the scope so I know it is gathering plenty of light as an 11" scope should. I tried both with and without the diagonal with no discernable difference. I have not collimated but supposedly it was collimated before leaving the factory and I would hope that even if it were off a bit from shipping I would still be able to see a sizable though fuzzy image of Mars instead of just a small speck of orangish light. Any thoughts as to what I may have done wrong or what may be causing this lack of clarity? 

Three or four weeks ago I was outside showing my neighbors how cool the moon was through a 'backyard' telescope in broad daylight (~8PM PDT). It was 3/4 of the way across the sky (setting behind the houses behind us.) Two weeks later the moon was not even up yet at 8PM. The planets I've been watching (Jupiter, Saturn, Mars) are all rising and setting a little earlier each day as I would expect. Why did the moon abruptly change its position in the sky a couple of weeks ago? 

Compared to the planets the moon changes it's rise and set times very quickly. Using the calculator on this page it can be seen that if one were looking at the sky on May 1st, 2014 from Irvine, California the moon set at 10:08PM (which at 8PM would have had the moon most of the way across the sky as noted in the question.) The moon rises and sets approximately one hour later each day. So, by May 14th the moon did not even rise until nearly 8PM - which also correlates with the observations noted above. Contrasting that with the other context point made in the OP, using this page we can see that on May 1st Saturn rose at 8:07PM and on May 14th rose at 7:11PM. So while the moon changes its rise a set times by almost an hour each day, the planets change much more slowly by comparison, almost an hour over two weeks. If one weren't continually watching the moon's progression it would appear to abruptly change positions when comparing it to the planets' movements.
