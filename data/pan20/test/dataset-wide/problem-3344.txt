As is, your question has no answer, since you haven't mentioned what theory or whose classification you were interested in. Here's what Hilde Hasselgård writes on this: 

Disclaimer: Historical linguistics is my hobby, it’s not my area of professional expertise. So here are my thoughts. Morphologically, we have CeRC here (R stands for the resonant). It’s an athematic noun, which means that endings were added directly to the stem (sunu-) without an intervening thematic vowel. Obviously, it is also an u-stem. All athematic nouns have strong (e.g. nom. and acc. sg., nom.pl.) and weak cases (the rest). If you subscribe to accent and ablaut paradigms, this particular noun is proterokinetic (or proterodynamic), which means that in strong cases the accent was on the full-grade root (the e-grade), whereas in weak cases both the accent and full grade shifted onto the suffix, so the u-suffix becomes –eu- (or –ou-, the o-grade) in weak cases. So, at this stage, we reconstruct NOM.SG. as *seunus - the standard citation form is the e-grade. However, in the (PIE) daughter languages the root didn’t ablaut already, cf. Sanskrit sunus, Lith. sunus etc. (sorry, no diacritics). Now about the root vowel. Usually the long u is not reconstructed as a vowel phoneme in the PIE. Since in Sanskrit and Lithuanian we have a long root vowel – and “y” in Slavic, we need something to make our short u long. If you subscribe to the laryngeal theory, obviously you propose a laryngeal H (capital H means unspecified); some researchers propose h3 here. So, now, at this stage, we reconstruct NOM.SG. as *seuHnus (or *seuh3nus). For weak cases, we could reconstruct the zero-grade stem *suHn-eu or rather *suHn-ou (other variants: *suh3neu, *suh3nou). Here's a partial paradigm for this noun (singular): IE *séu̯h3-nu-s ‘son’ NOM. *séu̯h3-nu-s ACC. *séu̯h3-nu-m DAT. *su̯h3-nóu̯ GEN. *su̯h3-nóu̯-s (Herzenberg 2010: 69) If you don’t subscribe to the laryngeal theory, you could use a schwa instead of the laryngeal or simply reconstruct *suənu-, without any ablaut. 

It seems that the term itself was coined by a soviet Arabist N.V. Yushmanov in his 1928 grammar of Arabic. He used it the sense of a circumfix, from Latin confixum "fastened together." I︠U︡shmanov, N. V. 1928. Grammatika literaturnogo arabskogo iazyka. Pod red. i s predisl. I.Iu. Krachkovskogo. Leningrad. Eins 2015 writes that in French linguistics confixe means a bound root (referring to Martinet) and then it was introduced to German linguistics (Konfix) in the same sense. This article in Glottopedia confirms this, 

There's a wealth of research on the ordering of adjectives (also notice that not in all languages nouns can be modified by more than one adjective): Dixon 1982, Sproat and Shih 1991, Bernsetin 1993, Bouchard 1998 (and other papers), Svenonius 1993 (and other papers), Scott 2002 to start with. Also, see some papers in Adjectives and Adverbs: Syntax, Semantics, and Discourse (2008), OUP. e.g., Dixon 1982: Value-Dimension-Physical Property-Speed-Human Propensity-Age-Colour

Available online at $URL$ Also, there's something wrong with your terminology. At first, there's no such thing as the "imperative" tense. The imperative is usually analyzed as a type of mood, because it expresses the speaker's attitude (i.e. modality). Secondly, you misanalyzed/miscategoried the forms in your examples (e.g. the "indefinite" tense etc.). 

I'd start with an excellent review article, The laryngeal and glottalic theories, by Ladislav Zgusta (2006), in History of Language Sciences, volume 3, pp. 2462-2479. 

Pronouns can be very tricky, so you should be very careful about using them as evidence of genetic relationship. At first, pronouns can be borrowed (and it seems to happen rather frequently, see Campbell and Poser 2008: 212-214). Secondly, similarity in form can be explained by what Nichols (2003) calls "resonance" (e.g. rhyme, alliteration etc.). That is why Antoine Meillet (1948) argued that "Pronouns are similar in almost all languages, though it does not imply a common origin. [...] Therefore, pronouns must be used with caution in establishing relatedness of languages." 

Examples: affero < *at-fero < *ad-fero (recomposition also possible - adfero) offero < *op-fero (recomposition also possible - obfero) effero < ec-fero (recomposition also possible - ecfero) cf. Weiss 2009/2011: 172, "Latin does not normally have f in non-initial positions. The few examples are in compounds and the family of inferus." Also note that the group "bt" in Latin was most likely pronounced [pt] (Tronskii 1960: 114). Prefixes ab-, ob-, and sub- are usually reconstructed as PIt. *ap-, *op-, and *sup- (Tronskii 1960: 113, de Vaan 2008). As for aufero (and aufugio), here's what you can find in de Vaan 2008: 

Usually it is argued that proper nouns have an extension ("the class of things to which it is correctly applied", Lyons 1977) but, unlike common nouns, they lack an intension ("the set of essential properties which determines the applicability of the term", Lyons 1977). In other words, the extension of Dublin is a singleton (or there might be more elements in that set, if there is more than one Dublin). However, Dublin has no intension at all - there is no property of "Dublin-ness" that all Dublins would share. Or another example. There are lots of people called John. However, there is no property that, by virtue of having it, qualifies you to be John. There is no "John-ness". You are named John ad hoc. An apple, on the other hand, can be described as "the round firm fruit, typically having crisp white flesh and green, yellow, or red skin" (from OED). All apples share certain properties (round, firm, fruit, having skin etc.). Willy van Langendonck (2007) argues that a proper name has the following characteristics: 

Note the key word "conceptual," because this is very different from other formal syntax theories. For instance, from the point of view of generative syntax, in both of your examples, we can see complements. 

No need to say that there is a lot of variation in linguistic terminology. See Table I.I below from Cowie 1998: 5 

To show how huge this terminological divide between Anglo-American linguists and the rest of the world is, in Granger and Meunier 2008 (23 papers, more than 400 pages), the term "set phrase" is used in two papers only (!), three or four occurrences only, the phraseological unit or phraseme being used much more frequently. For more details, see Burger, Dobrovol'skij, Kühn, and Norrick 2007 or a collection of papers in Granger and Meunier 2008. 

I'd go with no.1 because you can find the following minimal pairs in English (RP): could - cowed /ʊ/ versus /aʊ/ cheese - cheers /i/ versus /ɪə/ dead-dared /e/ versus /eə/ bell-bail /e/ versus /eɪ/ buy - boy /aɪ/ versus /ɔɪ/ etc. For a comprehensive list of minimal pairs in English (RP) compiled by John Higgins, see $URL$ Thus, a single diphthong in English represents one phoneme. This is traditional phonology, not generative. Naturally, other analyses have been proposed, too. For example, a diphthong is treated as a vowel plus a semivowel or another vowel (McCarthy 1952). Thus, you end up having a diphthong consisting of two phonemes under those approaches. Peter Roach (2009) mentions that this view was "almost universally accepted by American (and some British) writers from the 1940s to the 1960s, and still pervades contemporary American descriptions" (p. 104). Roger Lass (1984) argues that analyzing a diphthong as a vowel plus a semivowel /j/ or /w/ is a "shaky position" (p. 138). He also convincingly dismisses the approach proposed in SPE (Chomsky and Halle), characterizing it as "seem[ing] close to lunacy" (p. 138). Bruce Hayes (2008) concludes that the "fewer-phonemes-the-better" analysis is not an iron-clad argument and that the segment/sequence problem is still "an unsettled one in phonology" (p. 57). 

(this is meant to be a comment but it's too long so I posted it as an answer.) Zink (1986/2013) in his "Phonétique historique du français" gives the following reconstruction - I preserved his notation: kapillus IIIe s. ẹ IV2 kabẹllus Ve s. k̬aβ tšẹvẹllos VIIe s. tšẹvẹɫs XIe s. tševeus XII1 œ́us -2 œ́s XIIIe s. ševœ́(s) (afr. cheveus) 

I believe what you are describing is called reduction (or elision) and in case of h, it is usually known as h-dropping or h-deletion (e.g. Knowles 1987, Shockey 2003). What happens is that in connected, fast speech function words get unaccented and "show reductions of the length of sounds, centralization of vowels toward /ə,ɪ,ʊ/ and the elision of vowels and consonants" (Cruttenden 2014: 273). As for function words that start with h, the following words get affected: had, has, have, he, her, herself, him, himself, his (Cruttenden 2014: 274). In their weak forms, they may all lose h. Here's a screenshot of the relevant section from $URL$ 

In the European linguistic tradition, the term word family (or morphological family) is the most common way to refer to a group of words having the same root (e.g. Booij 2007: 4, Haspelmath and Sims 2010: 17), cf. Bauer 2004, A glossary of morphology: 

Incidentally, I would analyze enjoy as a simplex word, at least synchronically in (Modern) English; see the screenshot above.

Now you should be ready to learn narrow transcription. First learn to read it - e.g. the same passage from the IPA Handbook. Narrow transcription is the hardest. Eventually you may want to learn how to transcribe a language you don't know. 

Sorry for the delayed response. Here's how you would analyze your examples, according to Huddleston and Pullum 2002 and 2005: She found him lying on the bed. ‘Found him lying on the bed’ is a gerund-participial non-finite clause. It is also a plain-complex catenative construction. The verb ‘find’ here is a catenative verb and it belongs to class 3Cii (HP 2002). ‘Him’ is a direct object and ‘lying on the bed’ is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement. She found him injured. 'Him' is a direct object, 'injured' is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement. 'Find' is a complex-transitive verb here. 'Injured' is an adjective here - it allows modification, e.g. badly/severely injured. She found a note left on the table. The past-participle non-finite clause ‘left on the table’ modifies the NP ‘note’ – so it is an adjunct of spatial location (HP 2002, Chapter 8, §4). It is essentially equivalent to a finite relative clause: 'which/that was left on the table'. She found the suspects involved in the robbery. ‘The suspects’ is a direct object, ‘involved in the robbery’ is a depictive object-oriented (objective) predicative complement. 'Find' is a complex-transitive verb here. 'Involved' is an adjective here - it allows modification, e.g. deeply involved.
