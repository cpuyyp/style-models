I'd go for pure steam. It's easier than mixing steam/chemical propellants. Most chemical propellants don't like getting wet, so why bother with them? I'm going to design this just as a revolver and forget about the prosthetic hand. I'll also forget about your "trick shot" seventh shot through the center of the revolving chamber. It adds a lot of mechanical complexity. Quick disclaimer: I take no responsibility for people building something like this device. It is intended to show how the mechanism of a steam revolver could work, nothing more. 

So if you can hand-wave a good powersource that isn't more destructive by itself, then you can have your particle guns. (Is a fusion reactor powered particle accelerator more destructive than a fusion warhead? How about an antimatter reactor vs antimatter warhead?) So where might a particle accelerator be useable even on the large scale? A large space station will have several large reactors powering it's internal systems (eg heating). In a period of combat, the life support can be turned off (everyone get's into their spacesuits), and they power up some particle accelerators. 

Easy- make the lower-level positions easier to get into. Or, more precisely, make the lowest-level positions the only ones available to new recruits that don't already have experience from elsewhere. Of course many people will want to pilot the mechas, but there are only so many of them to go around. Anyone who wants to eventually pilot a mech will first have to get a job in the infantry, then once they prove their capability, loyalty, and so forth, if they are in the top 10% of all infantrymen, they could get to drive their own truck; the best truck drivers could graduate to humvees, the best humvee drivers could move up to tanks, the best tank drivers could ascend to bigger vehicles, and so on and so forth, until the very few best pilots of land vehicles in the entire military finally gain the privilege to pilot the mechas. There's no convincing anyone that they want to be in the infantry; the structure of the whole system makes it transparently clear to everyone that if they want to reach the top (and pilot the coolest vehicles), they've got to start at the bottom, with the understanding that if they truly are better at what they do than their comrades, they'll eventually rise through the ranks and get to where they belong. The "elite" in this system are just those who put in the work to rise to the top and/or got lucky and were naturally gifted with the exact qualities needed to rise through the ranks. If you want more details, I'd recommend looking at how real-life militaries work. While I am no expert on that subject myself, your system will most likely come out looking similar. 

Memory A creature must be able to learn, and part of this is remembering. It must be able to remember both short term and long term. The more accurate it's memory, the better. That said, human brains are pretty poor. We can't remember things even just moments after seeing/hearing them (at least, my face/name association sucks). Mental Speed. The Portia spider can actively plan a path to it's prey, it just takes a very long time to do so (on order of minutes). If an intelligence is too slow to "think" it will take a hugely long time to bootstrap as it will constantly be prey to other creatures. Mental Ability. This is a super-hard one to define, but one textbook (Artificial Cognition Architectures by James A. Crowder, John N. Carbone and Shelli A. Friess) lists things like reasoning and testing hypotheses as required for learning. However, I would list these as subsets of creativity and curiosity. Without those two traits we would not make anything new, nor seek to learn anything we did not already know. 

I should point out that this sort of arrangement, where two planets orbit each other close enough that their atmospheres touch, may not even be remotely possible. If a moon orbits too close to its planet, the tidal forces will rip it apart. On the side closer to the planet, the material at the surface of the moon will be lifted away, because the planet's gravitational attraction is stronger than the rest of the moon's; and on the opposite side, material will be slung out into space by the centrifugal force. The point where this happens is called the moon's Roche limit, and I have no idea how it applies if the "planet" and "moon" are the same size. I also don't know what impact this arrangement would have on the planets' atmospheres. They'd certainly be much thicker between the planets and at the planets' "ends" than around the planets' middles (although the air pressure at the surface of each planet should be pretty much the same everywhere), but for all I know, the centrifugal force could sling all of the atmospheres out into space. You'd also need to watch out for that. 

On the left we have a boiler. It's roughly based on a fire-tube boiler where the flame/exhaust passes through tubes in the boiler itself. This is more expensive to produce, but reduces the amount of time for your gun to "get steamed up." I'm not too concerned about the source of the fire. Perhaps it's coal-gas, perhaps propane, perhaps white spirits. I'd go for gas as there's less to go wrong if you drop your gun. Just for safety I've put a pressure gauge on there - so you don't end up firing half-charged shots without knowing about it, and you know if your gin is about to explode. Despite drawing the boiler in a position that looks like it may be a hand-grip, do not build it into the hand-grip. During operation it will exceed 100 degrees (pressure raises boiling temperature), so gripping it is a terribly bad idea. Old steam engines got up to about 250PSI, but because we have a small projectile we'll may need more than that. For reference the chamber pressure of a modern 9mm round is in the 34,000 PSI region. There's no chance we can get that high, but I hope your metallurgy is good enough to get to several hundred PSI. (the lower the PSI the longer your barrel will need to be, or the wider the round). In the middle we have a rotary valve. The D-shaped part rotates until the steam can flow from the boiler into the barrel. THe timing of this is quite important. If it's too short you lose power. If it's too long you waste water. This gives a way for the user to regulate the shot, providing a solution for the first part of your #8. I'd suggest an escapement mechanism for driving the valve, possibly with a spring to provide the rotation. The trigger just releases the escapement, it does a single turn and returns to it's original position. After the shot the same clockwork mechanism can rotate the chamber. This could provide a very consistent shot-to-shot power. The valve releases steam into the barrel, where it pushes the bullet along, and hopefully towards the enemy. 

Sure. That has precedent in Earth's animal kingdom; it's certainly possible. Though I'm not sure what you mean by "oval claws". 

This depends somewhat on how the chunks of Earth are being taken away and where they are going. If they just get dropped back down onto Earth at a different location, then there will be no overall effect and the Earth and the Moon will continue their orbits unaffected. If the chunks of Earth are thrown out into space and do not return to Earth, each one will take with it a bit of Earth's momentum, and due to the conservation of momentum, this will give the rest of Earth a small push in the opposite direction. If many chunks are propelled away from Earth in the same direction, these pushes will eventually add up to something noticeable. If each chunk is propelled in the same direction that Earth orbits the Sun, then each push will rob Earth of a little orbital speed, causing it to spiral in toward the Sun as long as pieces keep being removed. Conversely, if the pieces are propelled the other way (if they're being sent to Venus or Mercury, perhaps), Earth will be nudged into a larger orbit, farther from the Sun. If the chunks are always sent away in the same direction relative to the Moon, rather than the Sun, the recoil pushes will have an effect on the Moon's orbit. Keep in mind that the Earth and the Moon technically orbit around their shared center of mass (which is somewhere inside the Earth, but not at the center of the Earth). If the recoil pushes the Earth in the same direction that it orbits that center of mass, it'll add kinetic energy to the Earth-Moon system and effectively put the Moon into a slightly larger orbit. If the fragments of Earth are ejected in all different directions, so there is no net effect from the recoil, the Earth-Moon system's orbit around the Sun will not be affected at all. The only effect will be on the Earth-Moon system as the center of mass shifts toward the Moon. The distance between the Moon and what's left of the Earth will not change; however, as mass is removed from the system, the orbital period- that is, the time required for one to orbit the other- will increase. When Earth is reduced to an insignificant asteroid orbiting the Moon, it will make one orbit every 0.661 years. This means that the lunar "month" will actually last almost two full years, since the Earth and Moon orbit in the same direction that they orbit the Sun. 

YES! Deorbiting a 1 million tonne vehicle from LEO generates 6 petawatts of energy. This can safely be dissipated if your spacecraft has 20 liters of water per person (100,000 people) to evaporate during landing. Challenge #1: It has to hold it's own weight on earths gravity and be able to "withstand deceleration". Googling 'heaviest skyscrapre' led me to the fact that we can build self-supporting structures that mass in the hundreds of thousands of tonnes. I found figures like 700,000 tonnes. Needless to say, this is on the edge of plausible for your predicted 100,000 people (7 tonnes of life support + accommodation + hull + food per person). It doesn't leave a lot of overhead though. As a side note, in the 1960's, they were throwing around ideas for spacecraft weighing in excess of a million tonnes (Project Orion). Let's assume it's engine can accelerate it at 1G, then to take off/land from the surface of earth, the whole structure has to be able to withstand 2G of acceleration. Throw in some vibration and factor of safety, and you probably want to rate it a fair bit higher. This is no small feat, as most skyscrapers are designed for relatively static loading situations. I don't think any skyscraper would do well being dropped even a few meters, so your landing thrusters had better be able to set it down really really gently. Challenge #2: All that kinetic energy. Your spacecraft is in orbit and has to shed velocity to land. If you have super powerful engines and can both decelerate it before hitting the atmosphere, and lower it slowly through the atmosphere then this isn't a problem. If you plan on using aerobraking you're going to need a super super massive heatshield. LEO is 2-4km per second. Given a 1 million tonne vehicle you have some odd 4 petajoules of kinetic energy. While descending it will convert another petajoule or two of gravitational energy into kinetic energy. The descent time of the space shuttle shuttle was half an hour from 'entering' the atmosphere to landing. In this timeframe the city-spaceships heatshield has to deal with an average thermal load of over about three Terawatts. (Way more than a delorean). This level of power is on the same order of magnitude as USA consumes continually (average over 2005). To avoid needing to dissipate this energy with rockets, we can aerobrake and evaporate water. Evaporating water consumes 2Mj per kg of water evaporated, so if we pump water through vents in the front of the vehicle to absorb the heat, you will need about two million litres of water. Because you have 100,000 people on board, you will be carrying a lot of water: if you have 20 liters per person then you should have enough. Of course, designing the hydraulic system to dump 20,000,000 liters of water through the front of your vehicle is no easy feat. If you remember the comparison to the USA energy consumption, this means you could get the USA to boil a 20,000,000 litre kettle! 

This might be a better question for the English StackExchange, but I'll give it a shot anyway. What are your non-cellular beings made of? If, at small scales, they're made of something other than cells, what do they have instead? Are they piles of nanobots in the same way that humans are piles of cells, or do they more resemble something in a modern robotics lab? If they're mostly made of metal, perhaps with silicon or other semiconductors for information processing and something like silicone for their skin, you could use "inorganic" to contrast with carbon-based "organic" life. If your non-cellular beings are carbon-based, you might want to look at other ways they differ from cellular life. If they were created by mankind, you could use "artificial", "designed", or "created" to contrast with the "natural" products of Darwinian evolution. Or, you could make up your own. Such a thing as you describe doesn't really exist in the real world (so far as I am aware), so you've got pretty free range to come up with something that fits. You could, for instance, name these beings and their physiology after the person who first created or discovered them. We already speak of Darwinian evolution; why not Perryan biology? 

Communication. Assuming that a creature can perceive and manipulate, it is probably able to communicate. But the better it can communicate, the faster knowledge can be transferred. If communication is too slow, then the next generation cannot build on the work of the previous. If every generation has to discover that it can hit a lion with a rock, without the ability to learn from it's parents, then that intelligence will be limited to primitive tool use. Even if you injected knowledge into a single generation, the very next generation it would be lost. All major technological advances have ridden on the back of an improvement in communication. The most significant advances were probably: parenting, taming animals for riding, writing, printing press, radio, television, internet. Each one enabled a larger, more stable culture. Empathy No-one likes a race of psychopaths. Without the ability to empathise with others of it's race, a culture can never form, and they can never support the scientists and thinkers required for higher learning. You'd end up being limited to individual intelligence again, just the same as if you had no communication. I'd say that humanity rides the border of too-little empathy. We have fought with each other ceaselessly for generations and generations, and lots centuries of man-years of work to our lack of empathy. Riding with this is the physical requirement of being able to express emotion. Pure communication may not be enough, as we perceive emotion primarily through body language and looking at each others faces. If our faces were not expressive, would we be able to form a culture? I'm not sure.
