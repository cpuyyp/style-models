The reliability depends on the quality of the brifter itself but, for most brifters, all you need to maintain, adjust, and them and keep them in good working condition is a hex key set, some spray degreaser, and a high quality grease. I use mostly sram brifters and they just work when they are set up right. To keep them in good working order I remove the hoods and blast out the internals with degreaser, working the levers into different shifting positions until everything is clean and working smoothly. After they are dry I apply some high quality grease with a small brush to the mechanical parts inside, and then put the hoods back on. Extremely simple maintenance. Not fussy at all. I'm not sure why some competitive cyclists are that are telling you brifters are so unreliable, but, they are wrong. I believe 100% of the tour riders rode some sort of brifter in 2015. These are the cyclists who demand the utmost durability and certainly wouldn't use brifters if they were inherently flawed or fussy somehow. But, like any part, if they are low quality to begin with they will require more maintenance and will tend to be less reliable. 

I've torn a bunch of Castelli stuff over the years. I just started using this ShoeGoo product and it's working well so far. 

You can set up a hitch and trailer and tow the cargo. This of course requires the equipment and know-how to set it up but it might be a viable option if you can do it. Here is an example of one: 

The conclusion one can draw from this is that all things being equal, following these stats (and other sources below) one should always ride head on, because statistically, one has the least chance of collision, even if the closing speed is the greatest, which itself, would then seem not to have any correlation with risk of collision, or possibly an inverse relationship if assumption 3 is held. Head on collisions may have a higher incidence of fatality than others, I don't know. If someone finds data on that please share. In summary, riding at a lower relative speed (to other vehicles) alongside traffic is more dangerous but probably less fatal, whereas riding at a higher relative speed against traffic is statistically less dangerous but may prove to be more fatal in the event of an accident.

Track racing helmets have a built in visor, but these usually only cover the eyes. You can probably achieve what you want with a combination of a non vented helmet, wrap around glasses or goggles and a half-face mask or balaclava. There are numerous bicycle specific helmets made for commuting or casual riding that have minimal vents, or closable vents. Some have cold weather liners that fit to the chinstrap to cover the ears. There are half-face masks made for skiing, cycling or other cold wether use that are semi-rigid so that there is space between the mouth and nose and the mask. 

As @Nate Wengert says that screw is for adjusting chain tension. It pokes into the axle slot and prevents the axle from moving forward. It does not attach the axle or hub to the frame in any way. It sounds like you just need a bit more torque to get the axle nuts undone. If you cannot apply enough torque with a full size wrench, a short length of approximately 1" diameter sturdy metal pipe that can be slipped over a wrench handle to extend it for more leverage - sometimes known as a 'breaker bar' - is the usual tool of choice. Apply WD-40 or similar to help loosen the nuts before attempting to undo them. It's best to use a box-end wrench if you can. Avoid an adjustable wrench if possible because there is a greater chance of rounding the flats on the nuts. Also, you want to be really, really sure you are loosening not tightening (we've all done this at some time), especially if you use a breaker bar as you may end up rounding the flats on the nuts or stripping the threads. 

I would try buying a set of 28mm tires (or larger). You can run them at a lower pressure than a 23mm or 25mm and doing so won't likely cause the bite puncture you are experiencing b/c the air chamber is much larger and thus has more area to compress before it nips at the tube. An upside is that the ride quality is far superior to say, a 23mm. Also, make sure you are installing your tube properly. If it isn't seated under the tire just right you will keep pinching it over and over. Start at the valve stem and keep it even as you work it under the tire. Roll the tire around with your fingers and palm to seat the tube after you get the tire back on, and before inflating the tube to pressure. DON'T use levers to get the tire back on if possible. Just another opportunity for a pinch. I ride a road bike with Conti 28mm tires on a daily commute through Chicago with many potholes, broken glass piles, nails, etc. and haven't had a pinch flat or puncture in probably a year, and, I ride them at a very low pressure (80psi/ 175lb rider) When I did flat last it was because the tube was not installed properly. 

Along with the aforementioned supplies there are two small rubber tubes, hollow, and about 1cm long. What are these and how would one potentially use them with the patch kit? 

To add to Michael's comment if it's your property you can't be forbid to bring a bicycle into your apartment, unless it's somehow unlawful to be in possession of said bicycle. Would you be forbid to bring a crank set or a pair of wheels or a bar set into your apartment? Why would you be forbid to bring those things assembled in a certain way into your apartment? Read your lease very carefully, or get a lawyer and ask him or her about your situation considering your lease. If you can meet the building owner or property manager and ask, indirectly, about bicycles, do so and get a feel for their attitude about it. If you can tell they are going to be giving you a hard time about it don't even bother, look elsewhere. Having a bad landlord and/or building owner is a whole other problem in and of itself. 

I believe that is an Ultegra 6600, made from 2005 to 2008 (according to Wikipedia). Not sure you will be able to narrow it down to the exact year. 

There are some differences between modern and 'classic' bike sizing, but a quick google search says no, it's too big for you. $URL$ What you were told is true, the seat tube length measurement is not an exact size. There is variation between manufacturers. It was a good method to size bicycle frames when all bikes had a horizontal top tube and similar geometry. It's a very poor way to size modern bicycles that come in many styles and frame geometries, hence the move to 'stack and reach' sizing. BTW, the consensus on this site is that one really needs to test ride a bike to know if it fits. 

Shopping advice and product recommendations are specifically off-topic here. However, general advice: Shimano makes products in a deliberate hierarchy of incrementally improving features, weight and quality. The feature you probably want is removable chainrings, so when those wear out you don't have to replace the whole crank. The FC-M361 is from a higher product line (Acera) than the other two and has that feature (you can see the chainring bolts in pictures online) the other two do not appear to have it. 

From the picture that seems to be the brake lever clamp. The bolt can be removed, cleaned or replaced and reinstalled with no problems. Make sure to note the position of the lever in case it moves or falls off when the bolt is removed. You can then position it properly when you re-install the bolt. 

Are there any technical limitations that make 3D printing frames impractical? And, if it is just a matter of time before our technology is able to overcome any limitations (like manufacturing techniques and processes), will 3D printed frames theoretically be better in so far as they will be able to be made with exact thicknesses, tolerances, etc. and also be lighter in weight? I'm interested in the implications for the common frame metals - steel, aluminum and titanium - as well as carbon. 

So, 11 speed groups are great, but as everyone knows, they are old news and manufactures are constantly innovating and upgrading to sell "this year's" new parts. 11 speed has been around for a while now and I was wondering if any of the big names are developing a 12 speed group? Are there any freehubs that could support this? Personally, I wouldn't rush out to but one but it seems inevitable. 

Most cyclist will try to avoid a collision at all costs A collision is prerequisite for fatality Speed difference is always greater head-on than same direction, rider speed and vehicle speed held equal 

I also live in a Midwestern city, Chicago, and if you are riding on the sidewalk - i.e. moving at any moderate pace with legs slung over the top tube - you are in the wrong 99.99% of the time, unless you are under 12 years old. God forbid you actually hit someone on the sidewalk. I get chewed out in the hundred meters it takes to make it from the street, onto the sidewalk, and into my front door. To your question: Is it safer? Well that depends. It sounds like it's legal riding and fairly unoccupied on the sidewalks by you. In that case it may be safer. I think the bigger concern is your riding habits in general. You can't take your sidewalk riding habits with you anywhere, be it safe or not. So what happens when you realize you love to do long road rides and all you know is how to maneuver on the sidewalk? There aren't any interesting sidewalk rides I know of in the Midwest. Better to learn how to navigate in real traffic patterns on trafficked streets. That is the least common denominator in the real world - streets with traffic. You will have to get on them and in the mix at some point. It's part of riding. So, I think it will behoove you to start riding on the road as much as you can, even if it's busy. When it comes time for you to do a long group ride, it definitely wont be on the sidewalk, and you will be better prepared. In my humble opinion, those who regularly ride the streets are safer riders in general - they are better bike handlers, have better reactions, are more intimate with traffic patterns, and some (many) are even safer drivers because of it. 

Looks like the decathlon.in page is for the retail outlet. There is a separate Rockrider 540 page on the BTwin site that says the bike has Suntour XCR 100mm travel forks. I assume there is an error on the Decathlon page. 

From the video it does indeed look like the derailleur is being prevented from moving properly. You need to determine where the cause of that is. I think that most likely it's the cable or housing that is the problem. 1) Examine the shifter cable and housing, make sure there are no kinks, tight radii bends etc. Make sure the housing is fully inserted in any bosses, including shift levers and derailleur barrel adjuster. Make sure there are no obstructions to any sections of uncovered cable. 2) Remove rear wheel, shift gears at the levers and check the derailleur is going through its full range of motion and not sticking, especially on upshifts (cable loosening). 3) Disconnect the shifter cable from the derailleur, move the derailleur through it's range manually. Check there is no stickiness and the parallelogram spring is positively returning the derailleur to the high (outer) position. 4) Hold the shift cable at the derailleur end and put a little tension on it, run the shifters through all the gears. Check the cable is moving freely as you go through all the gears. This should make it obvious if it is the derailleur itself that is sticking, or the cable, or possibly the shifter. 

Depending on the bike, a single good drive side photo can suffice. As @nollak says: including good, well lit close up pictures of parts of interest to highlight higher end components, good condition, lack of wear etc. is a good idea. As @Grigory Rechistov says, pics of minor cosmetic damage you want to 'own up to' help to depict you as an honest seller. 

I went from 42cm to 40cm bars on a road bike and experienced the same symptoms. The switch to narrower bars can definitely cause tricep pain at the elbow. So, yes, tricep pain can be a symptom of narrow bars (it could be from other things too). Whether it is a temporary or a permanent symptom can be gleaned by how you feel after you've had some time to adjust to your new setup. It sounds trivial, but make sure when you are riding in this new cockpit, that you keep your elbows bent and use your arms as suspension/dampening/etc. If you aren't able to ride comfortably with your elbows not locked out, this is a problem. If this is the case, I'd first add some rise to the stem to bring the bars up a bit. If you still can't get a comfortable position, then I'd recommend getting another set of 42's and riding what you know is comfortable and works for you. 

You should buy a presta pump, especially if your wheels already have presta valves. But one fitted with a pressure gauge as well. 

Sprinter A sprinter is a type of rider who is known for explosive power and acceleration. They often have a large build, usually with massive quads and strong upper bodies. Since they are relatively heavier than other riders their speed advantage is often limited to flatter sections and they can and are often dropped in hilly terrain. Sprinters are know for drafting in the slipstream of teammates (usually the domestiques) who are sheltering them, before launching into a sprint in the final meters of a race. Some sprinters are stronger in hillier terrain and cobblestones, and are sometimes categorized to be Puncheurs. They often excel in the classics races. Mark Cavendish
