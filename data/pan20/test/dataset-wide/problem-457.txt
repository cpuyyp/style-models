I would check with your local bike shops and clubs, there are lots of cycling "coaches" out there that will tell you exactly what you should be doing to get the most out of it. Essentially the personal trainers of the bike world. I would also recommend doing some reading on optimal heart rate and zones. Coaches and classes can be expensive but if you read up on it you can do a lot of the same with a cycling computer and heart rate strap. However you may find that joining a "no drop" group ride could be equally beneficial as a starting point as they will offer advice as well. Also, less related but I see you're in GA but down here in TX, we just started getting these places called Cyclebar ( $URL$ ) They play loud music and have and instructor and lighting effects, but they also track every aspect of your workout and can custom tailor it so that you get the most out of your training. All while in a group similar to a spin class but in the atmosphere of a club or bar(minus the drinking :P) They are suppose to be really fun and a good work out. I have yet to try it myself but it has definitely intrigued me. 

Based on the style of lugs and overall frame style, My guess is a 1980 Raleigh Competition or Competition GS. It looks like one that has had the frame stripped and then polished. Similar to this one seen here: 

There are other options out there, just one i came across are these Origin 8's that are 99% silver, they have black endcaps but wouldn't break the bank. Tektro's version below them. 

Skipping the "proper" bedding in process can do this yes. Bedding in brake pads impregnates the rotor surface with material. There is a particular process to do it because you want a good even layer. If skipped, the will still get "bedded in" but possibly unevenly, causing vibrations and ultimately a shudder like you have described as the pads skip over these slightly thicker portions of the rotor. The proper method has guidelines of how fast and how hard to brake which has been proven to help keep the bedded layer smooth. Also if not bedded in and then ridden EXTREMELY hard brand new, meaning some downhill action,it is possible (but unlikely) to get hot spots much like car brake rotors can get when super heated beyond their intended use. Their are several ways to handle this situation, there is a resurfacing paste product called Squeeel Out that works decent, or you can resurface them yourself which generally works pretty well. To do so you will sand both the pads and the rotor surface, and then follow the initial bed in procedure. When sanding the pads, it is easiest to lay a piece of sandpaper on a hard flat surface and drag the pad around in circular motions. Sand the pad directly doesn't work as well because you don't get an even sanding. The rotor can be done a similar way, or by laying the rotor on a flat surface and hand sanding with a sanding block. You don't have to take a ton of material off, just remove the surface contaminants. After sanding the rotor clean with alcohol and allow to dry. Some people would recommend buy a new rotor and/or set of pads but i have had good luck with saving them the ways mentioned above. While you have the rotor off you can also check that it is true, but that shouldn't be an issue with it being new, but then again i have seen them come out of the package slightly bent. 

You said that it is laterally and radially true, dished correctly and properly tensioned. Sounds like its ready to ride! As far as i know there is no real true test method other than riding. I would just take an easy ride around the block or on a tame trail. You may find that after riding for a bit you will need to re-tension some of the spokes after they have settled in. This is pretty normal with use. 

I work in the bicycle industry and have never heard nor needed to know the term Flat Folding Width of a tube. Is this even pertinent information to anything other than maybe how many you can jam in your pack? Anyone familiar with or heard this term before? I'm guessing it's the size of a tube when its still folded up with no air, basically right out of the box.. Which seems really pretty pointless to me. It would be on the distribution side of the industry but even to a shop i don't see it having a point as the boxes they come in will be the deciding factor for stocking on a shelf, not the tube inside. Anyone heard this term or can think of a reason it would be important to anything? 

Generally speaking you shouldn't need either. The tolerances for press fit parts are made to do just that Press Fit! I have seen some mechanics use grease when pressing the headset but that is more so for ease of installation. It takes a lot more pressure to get it out than it does in. Being that you may need to change them at some point I would stay away from loc-tite as that layer will also effect the tolerances for said parts. The best bet is to always check the manufacturers specifications as well. In short I would use neither as long as you have the correct press tools. 

They definitely exist for bicycles. I work for a distributor that stocks them, they are referred to as adult stabilizers. They only thing i'm not sure of is how compatible they are with recumbents. One other thing to consider would be a recumbent trike or a tadpole trike which is just a recumbent with 3 wheels rather than two. I realize a new ride can be quite expensive though, the adult stabilizers are also a bit pricey however. The MSRP on the ones we carry is over $200 but that is because they are heavy duty and hold up to 300lbs. I was going to write this as a comment but it became lengthy and i thought an image may be helpful in deciding whether or not something like these could be attached to your recumbent. 

The "Best" brake system greatly depends on the type of riding to be done. Trials bike with extremely strong brakes are perfect for hopping around and locking the wheel up instantly, they however would not be so great at trail riding where disc brakes with good modulation are ideal. From a service and everyday joe stand point, my choice would probably be mechanical disc brakes as they are easy to adjust and service (No bleeding etc) while they also provide ample stopping power if decent quality and are adjusted right. I however use Hydraulic disc brakes as i'm a big fan of the modulation, or ability to slow down quickly without actually locking up the rear wheel unless i want to. But most of the riding i do is on dirt trails. The main selling point of hydraulic disc brakes is there is very little friction in the system. Where as a cable driven disc brake has friction present in the entire system essentially as the cable slides through its housing. Resulting in a slightly different lever feel and power. Cantilevers would be my choice for road and commuter use as they are tried and true, they put up with abuse and wet pretty well and they are easy to fix and adjust even on the side of the road with minimal tools. With that said, i don't think there is a concrete "right" answer to this questions unless it is in regards to a specific riding style or location. I would not personally want to ride old school rod brakes down a long decent either. Although i have done it plenty of times with V-brakes i would prefer a disc, although many good quality V-brakes have nearly equal stopping power. So it really comes down to the individual and what they are trying to accomplish. From Sheldon Brown 

However just because it will fit on the rim does not mean it will not rub on the frame so that is what is most important. For small changes such as from 26 x 1.95 to 26 x 2.125, or 700C x 23 to 700C x 25 you are almost certainly safe from a rim standpoint if the bicycle was factory equipped with 1.95"/700x23 tires. To be certain, the model of rim should be referenced and the width noted. Please also note that the same applies to going to a smaller tire size, too small of a tire on the same rim could not seal well and potentially cause flats or blowouts when the tire bead cannot seal against the rim well enough.
