Regarding the presence of $l$ in the Frisch elasticity, your result is correct. It is my impression that a Frisch elasticity free of $l$ requires very specific functional forms. For example we know that the following utility function $$U(c,l) = ln(c) +\alpha \frac {(1-l)^{1+1/v}}{1+1/v} \tag{1}$$ gives a Frisch elasticity independent of $l$ (and then $\eta=v$). We could compare this with your utility specification and say "ah, so we must have additive separability to obtain a Frisch elasticity independent of $l$"... No, this is not enough. Note that essentially $(1)$ does not express utility as a positive non-linear function of leisure but as a negative non-linear function of labor, and so the term $1-l$ appears. This is critical to eliminate $l$ from the final expression. Because, if we assume additive separability in general, then the cross-partial derivative is zero and we would be left with $$\eta = \frac{u_l}{- u_{ll}}\frac{1}{1-l} \tag{2}$$ If the additively separable utility function is expressed as a non-linear positive function of $l$, and not as a negative non-linear function of $1-l$, $(2)$ would also be dependent on $l$. -- Also, with your utility function specification, I do not find that $\sigma$ is out of the final picture. Instead I find $$ \eta = \frac{\gamma(1-\sigma)-1}{(\omega+\gamma)(1-\sigma)-1}\frac{l}{1-l}$$ If $\omega = 1-\gamma$ this simplifies to $$ \eta = \frac{1-\gamma(1-\sigma)}{\sigma}\frac{l}{1-l}$$ But these are treacherous algebraic calculations - you should recheck. 

The "constant term" in the regression specification may be a consequence of the theoretical model that is estimated. For example, if we assume a production function of the form $$Q = AK^aL^b$$ then taking logarithms we obtain the linear-in-logarithms specification $$\ln Q = \ln A + a\ln K + b\ln L$$ and it appears that the constant term in the econometric regression specification will be estimating the logarithm of the production shifter (technology) $A$. ...but also, the constant term guards to a degree against misspecification: if we wrongly assume that the error term that will appear in the stochastic specification has a zero mean, then the inclusion of the constant term, even if it is not provided by the theory, effectively "takes on" this non-zero value, permitting to treat the now transformed stochastic error as indeed zero-mean. This is important for one of the dominant methods of estimation in econometrics, Least-squares: this method produces unavoidably residuals that have zero mean. And we want to be able to assume that the unknown error is also zero-mean, so that we can treat the residuals as a good estimator of the unknown error. Now if one puts these two together, one realizes that interpreting the constant term is problematic: does it represent the constant postulated by the theory, or the non-zero mean of the error term? And if both, what meaning could we give to its magnitude, so as to subsequently test this magnitude? ...this is why, in many econometrics papers, the constant term is not discussed at all, while in others, it is not even reported. 

A schematic picture is as follows: Industrialization also means industrialization of Agriculture. This kills land-related jobs in the sector while at the same time it increases output. Inceased output requires preservation since it can't be immediately consumed as fresh product. So jobs are created in the "packaging" business-end of Agriculture, which turns farm-workers into factory-workers already. Moreover, the job-transformation is not one-to-one so a surplus of ex-farm workers is created, and they have to seek work in factories outside the Agriculture sector. In more abstract terms, capital displaces labor from the traditional Agricultural activities, while also it creates demand for labor in the agriculture-related and other manufacturing activities. 

First, we need to assume that the minimum wage is an "effective constraint", i.e. that in the cases examined people are paid the minimum wage. I guess this holds. Second, the negative relation between demand for labor (for the services sold by workers) and wage (its price), depends on an assumption of a smooth such relation. In turn, such a smooth relation depends on substitutability of factors of production: in order to decrease labor employed, one needs to increase capital employed (if it has no reason to alter the production level). Is it the case that the services offered by minimum wage workers in the study mentioned, could be readily substituted by capital? If not, here is one explanation. Another way for a firm to respond to a minimum wage increase, is to try to increase the intensity of work, so it could fire people and maintain essentially the same level of services with fewer workers that are paid the higher minimum wage, keeping the total cost the same. Is it the case that minimum wage workers in the study mentioned worked with some slack, and there was still room to press them to work harder? If not, here is another explanation. So it may be the case, that the firms have done their "profit making job excellently", and have managed to have the lowest operationally possible level of labor, by extracting full efficiency from it, but also from the point of view of factors substitution capabilities... and then came the minimum wage increase. The firms simply had no options, (at least in the short run), than, perhaps, to pass the cost over to consumers, or live with lower profits, because they were already operating at their efficiency frontier with the minimum feasible amount of labor. In such a case, the minimum-wage increase has a pure income-redistribution effect. 

negates the fundamental premise of this theory, and leads to some other theory, one apparently incorporating a general principle of "preservation of value" (which by the way, is what the Accounting discipline is based on). 

In this simple problem, using a Lagrangean is an overkill, direct substitution of the constraint is perhaps better. Anyway, treating the two consumption levels as two distinct decision variables under the budget constraint, the Euler equation emerges from the combination of the two first-order conditions: $FOC$'s $$\frac {\partial \mathcal L}{\partial C_1} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac 1{C_1} = \mu$$ $$\frac {\partial \mathcal L}{\partial C_2} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac {\beta}{C_2} = \mu\frac {1}{1+r_1}$$ Substitute the first into the second $$\frac {\beta}{C_2} = \frac 1{C_1}\frac {1}{1+r_1}$$ re-arrange and you 're done. I would suggest to also do that with a general utility function, where in the Euler equation the first derivatives of the utility will appear. 

This is a misuse of terms. The marginal product of capital net of depreciation is indeed $MP_k - \delta$, there is no doubt about it. What the authors mean is that $$R = 1 + (MP_k - \delta) $$ is the "gross return on capital" factor. In fact a few lines below the equation they call it exactly that, which is the correct term. Here "gross" reflects the inclusion of $1$. 

The moment an unknown and unknowable in advance future quantity enters an optimal solution, we have no other option than to insert in its place some estimation of it. The more widely used such estimation (but not the only one) is the conditional expectation. Conditional on $t$, everything except $s_{t+1}$ will be treated as a constant. Since we do not know how exactly $s_{t+1}$ enters the $f$-function, we write in abstract notation as a function: $$E\big[f(\alpha_t,\beta_t,s_t,h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t\big]=0 \Rightarrow f(\alpha_t,\beta_t,s_t,E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t]) =0$$ Remember also that the conditional expectation is a function, and not a constant (as is the unconditional expected value). Since this is a solution, to study comparative statics one has to use the implicit function theorem which states that, starting at the solution, $$\frac{{\rm d}s_t}{{\rm d}\alpha_t} = -\frac {\partial f(\alpha_t,\beta_t,s_t,E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t]) / \partial \alpha_t}{\partial f(\alpha_t,\beta_t,s_t,E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t]) / \partial s_t}$$ The partial derivative symbol in the right-hand side conveys the message that in the numerator, $s_t$ is not to be differentiated with respect to $\alpha_t$, and in the denominator, $\alpha_t$ is not to be differentiated with respect to $s_t$ (and the same holds with respect to $\beta_t$). But $E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t]$ is fair game in both cases. What will the operations $\partial E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t] /\partial \alpha_t$ and $\partial E[h(s_{t+1},...)\mid t] /\partial s_t$ yield, will depend of course on what is the actual expression for the conditional expectation.
