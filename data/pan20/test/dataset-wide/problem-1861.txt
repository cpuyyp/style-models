I don't take that as they expect an open-source project or even a github profile. They would like codes samples from you and want to know if they are available. If you don't have code samples then they will either need to forego code sample(s) or give you a problem statement and ask for a code sample. Anymore employers are going to want code samples especially with little experience. Create a github and post a couple code samples that show off your strengths. As for how to respond? Simple, I don't contribute to any open-source and I don't have a github. Don't imply it is an inappropriate question. 

If you are going to take a year off no better time then now. You took 4 (or so) years to get a PhD. Is your knowledge going to go stale in in a year? Go for it and see the world now. A PhD in software engineering is going to find a (very good) job today or next year. Going for a PhD is a differed thing in the first place. You did not do nothing during the year. You saw the world. If you have the money to see the world now then money is not that tight. 

How to not feel frustrated? Paul is not your problem. Let it go. This is a management problem. Stay within your sphere of influence not your sphere of concern. If you are feeling negatively towards Paul that is your problem. You can control you feelings. 

In an office you may describe a person as a power user as a general qualifier. A help desk person may say one of our power users is having a problem with X - it means that X may be broken rather than the user is likely just confused. But it is not appropriate on a resume as it could mean so many things. You should list out specific skills 

The fact he is behaving this way when you gave the notice is even more reason not to have informed him in advance. He reacted out of emotion and made it a problem with you. If you had told him in advance he would likely have lashed out at you. Worse case terminate you before you could find another job. The fact you did not complain is not a negative in my opinion. You have very little power to him placing fault with you. I would focus on a clean transition. Even if a new person is not found before you leave document everything you can. Focus on finishing up existing task rather than start a task you will not finish. 

I know not desirable but put in for a lateral change. If they say you are too valuable in your current position then ask why you have not been promoted. It they ask why tell them I don't seem to be able to get promoted in my current position so I want to expand my base of skills to hopefully get a promotion. 

Sound like your CEO wants to use drug testing as a way to get rid of employees. That is one way to do it but don't call it random if that is how it is executed. Update 

Leave it on forever. 1) People should stop contacting you if they read it 2) The business will eventually (if not immediately) forward your email and shut down your account 

This would depend on if the person knows it is urgent If they know it is urgent then just ask for a status 

Face it the emails are not working. With all the emails I get managing new procedures on an email by email basis would difficult. I get some people will make it a priority and comply. For others making them acknowledge they got the email and read is not going to fix it. When they fail the audit are they claiming they never got the email? Have a couple mid level workers review a procedure before it goes out to make sure it makes sense to them. Maybe the person that had the worse audit get to be on the review team. For me I would want an application that had all the procedure organized by topic / flow. And another section with all new / changed procedures ordered by date with more recent first. I would would a want check box that I can mark it as read. I know it may seem like overkill but form a team and task them with improving procedure compliance. First you need to educate people on the purpose and importance of procedures. Second look for best way to distribute updates. Third you need to have an internal program for measuring compliance. 

First meet with the boss and other interns and clearly define working prototype. To some people dummy data is a working prototype. I don't agree with no error handling. My experience is you spend more time with un-handled errors than it would take to just handle them in the first place. Is the data design complete? Then define the classes. If you define the interfaces (classes) to the server what is the harm with some mock ups that return dummy data and let him start on the UI? Later you return and get real data. Take charge of the project. This intern should have assigned project tasks. Once you define scope / structure then it is easy to reply task X is out of scope. 

I don't think too much power is the problem. IT needs the power to inspect data, change data if require, backup, and restore. You should focus on accountability part. Business impact statement. If a task needs business sign off before proceeding then have that in writing. For example you may need sign off from accounting before changing any data in certain tables. If there is data that IT is not supposed to see then encrypted tables or something. Let them know the cost / impact to IT. I suggest a report of the duties of IT and let them adjust if necessary. If the business wants to interject over site on identified tasks then fine. 

You are in a really tough spot. What your boss is asking you to do is wrong and he knows it is wrong. You stated he has bullied people out of the company that have challenged him. If you challenge him up front the problem is that you have no allies. The hours have not yet hit the other projects and PMs. So he may decide to just bully you out of the company. I would charge the time to other projects and keep records. If you are asked about it then tell them you were instructed to charge time from another project. Pretend like you figured it was OK. If they ask for proof then produce the email. You won't be blamed for making Bob look bad - he did that to himself. Now things could get ugly and you could be collateral damage. But at least it is an open battle and would be harder for Bob to bully you out without making himself look bad. Ideally you want to make this between Bob and the PMs.
