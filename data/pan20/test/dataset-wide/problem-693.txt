A number of things. The tyre pressure could have been too high for the weight of the person riding it (you don't always need to inflate a tyre to the max pressure), the inner tube could have naturally weakened with age, the rider may have hit a pothole or thorns/nails without remembering it that pierced the tire and tube. Ultimately; it doesn't matter. The tube is punctured AND old; get a new one and brush it up as bad luck. I doubt reverse engineering the problem at this stage will help you reduce punctures in the future. 

When in doubt, it's much easier to just completely replace the inner tube. They are consumable (like brake pads) and will only cost you a couple of pounds/dollars. This can be annoying and tricky at first but after a few tries should only take 5-10 minutes or so. In my opinion, it's easier and quicker to just buy new tubes the next time you're passing a bike shop and spend 15 minutes replacing them than spending several hours identifying and repairing the old tubes - and having the psychological weight of whether or not your repair was fully successful looming over you whenever you ride. 

I spent a week cycling in the Alps (ALpe D'Huez, Galibier) just from training in the UK and, to be honest, it was fine. I'd argue that the alpine climbs are easier than the types you find in the UK. Bear with me. Judging by that activity on Strava, I imagine you will be more than capable of riding these climbs. Alpine climbs are long (I was three and a half hours up the Galibier from the bottom of the Telegraph) but they tend to have an even gradient and rarely go over 10% for longer than a few dozen metres at a time. British climbs tend to be short and incredibly mean, with ramps of 20%+ in places followed by false flats combined with terrible surfaces. British climbs are like a sprint, where you need to go all in to get over the steep sections, recover, then tackle another steep section - plunging into oxygen debt, recovering and trying to hold it. Alpine climbs are a different beast. Assuming you have a low enough ratio (I had a 34 cog on the front and a 28 at the back) you should be able to ride in your endurance zone at a reasonable cadence without going into oxygen depth or building up too much lactic acid, apart from at the steepest sections. Obviously, this depends largely on your own fitness and lactic threshold etc. So, what can you do to prepare? I recommend finding a local hill of a similar gradient to the climbs you want to tackle (I imagine between 6% and 8%) of reasonable length (2km+) and taking it in your smallest gear. You should be able to ride to the top of it at a pace that doesn't leave you out of breath or sore - remember you'll need to do 10x this distance at that effort level in the alps. For training, forget climbing, unless you have a 20 minute long climb nearby. Think distance, you need to consider doing some longer intervals of 20-40 min duration at your threshold pace. THis was the mistake I made - I trained for a one hour climb by doing hard 6 minute hill repeats up a steep climb. This was almost completely wasted -> I had a great VO2 max and sprint but neither of these are particularly useful in a long steady state climb! You need to practice for the effort level and length of the climb in question. Most of all though, just go ride and have fun. The climbs are intimidating but they're only real monsters when you're racing other people up them. They are only as hard to climb as the speed you decide to charge up them at. Edit: In terms of altitude, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Don't sprint. Don't go anaerobic. If you're effort level is steady and sustainable for several hours you'll be fine as you get higher. The problem is when you try to go hard and you can't take in enough oxygen for the added effort. You sort of just slow to a crawl and it gets incredibly difficult to recover from without stopping for a real breather. Even still, I didn't notice too much of a difference until 2200m or so (so only the very top of the climb at most) but your milage may vary. 

Sheldon Brown's Wheelbuilding page links to the article: Check Spoke Tension by Ear. Obviously a tensiometer would be ideal, but Sheldon suggests that checking spoke tension by ear is a reasonable alternative. The article was written in 1987 and updated in 1997; are there any developments from the last 10 to 20 years that would invalidate the technique or require adaptation? For example, the article mentions that dished wheels require a different pitch on the left and right sides, but how great should this difference in pitch be? In general, how effective is tensioning by ear? 

Cycling is a varied experience including many different reasons to ride, such as commuting, fitness, or racing. Experience is further shaped by the type of bike and environment. The book Bike Snob tries to distill what cyclists have in common and presents the definition of a cyclist as someone who chooses to ride a bike even if they don't have to. The book further argues that there's no such thing as "bike culture". However, it also summarizes (in a humorous fashion) some of the types of cyclists and how they often view each other. Even though there's no uniform bike culture, many individual people have their own philosophy. You may be able to find some biographies or autobiographies about cyclists who describe their own attitude toward cycling and how it changed them. Of course, there are many groups of like-minded people who might share an approach to cycling. One website that often gets cited online is Velominati, which declares a list of rules for road cycling which they claim to be philosophical. This type of "philosophy" seems to be more about creating a sense of belonging than about any inherent truths about cycling--people want to be able to feel "in the club". Given the variety within cycling, any universal philosophy would be limited to the vague notion of self-powered locomotion. 

The rule of thumb of "the highest possible without wobbling the hips down to reach for pedals" seems like a better rule than "having the barefoot heel just touch the pedal with the leg completely straight when the pedal is completely down". If your saddle is at the right height, it should be difficult to place a foot on the ground while seated. Now that your saddle is at what seems to be a more appropriate height, you may have to change any habits that developed during the time that you had a lower saddle. Remaining seated on the saddle at a stop is uncomfortable on a well fitted bike. You should find stops much more comfortable if you stand over your top tube with one foot flat on the ground. With a bit of practice, you should be able to use a single push with your foot to simultaneously begin to pedal forward while lifting yourself onto the saddle. Clipless pedals make this easier because you can easily position the crank by "pedaling backwards" to the desired position. With a little bit of practice, this will become perfectly natural. 

It will certainly be more difficult than riding a standard bicycle. Although I don't feel like it would be impossible by any means. The factors to consider are: Weight - the Tandem weighs a lot more than a standard bicycle Wind - larger surface area means more effect from crosswinds Length - This will play very little with the transport as far as riding it to a friends house, other than turning, but plays a major factor in future transport by car or bus Tandems have a pilot, and a stoker, the rear rider being the stoker, and all steering is done by the pilot or front riding. Therefor the stoker is only there to help out with pedaling and enjoy the ride. So yes it will be more difficult but I wouldn't rule it entirely impossible. You will look lonely however ;) 

Chris H has the right idea. Eventually when you replace the brake cables leave it long so you can tuck it on the outside of the brake pad. For the time being i agree with Chris, do what you can to try and prevent it from rubbing because over time it will wear a groove in the tire if it hasn't already. Here is an image from Trek`s website showing how they have it long and tucked to the side. Nice brakes but the cable routing leaves some to be desired in my opinion. 

It is also possible with a brand new razor blade but the proper plier like tool makes it a lot more quick and easy. For hydraulic hoses they differ slightly because of the difference in hose material, there are two type of hydraulic hose cutters, one that looks a bit like a pill cutter such as this: 

There are several forums that cater to vintage bikes, one of the best in my humble opinion is the Cabe - The Classic and Antique Bicycle Exchange
