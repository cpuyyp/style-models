One of the pitfalls in such a meeting is directly jumping to the problem the person is supposed to solve. You then tend to omit the human-level interaction. What greatly helps (and some consultants are taught to) is to build trust with the cooperant in the beginning, clear the air with even some chit-chat. Once it is achieved, the talks go much smoother. Long story short - treat this person as a human being, not as a problem-solving machine. If you get the click, you'll go a long way. If not, you can still achieve your goal, but it will be rough and bumpy. 

This way you won't mix irrelevant activities into your professional resume while keeping company A on your resume. 

I clearly understand your problem. You can start with kindly but firmly reminding your boss that officially you are not allowed to use the product any longer and surely you won't be legally allowed to release your product without obtaining the licence from ABC. Happy flow is that your boss buys the licence or appoints you to purchase one. Sad flow - your boss will say "dobra, dobra" [all right, all right] meaning that you should carry on without a licence. It would be, (as far as I know the software agreements), breach of trial agreement. Whether you might have problems depends on your employment form (employee or contractor). To be 100% sure you should ask a lawyer. And yes, you should remind your boss to purchase the licence. 

Yes, you can :-) Generally this behaviour is caused by the fact that you want to start to say something before your mind is prepared about what you want to say. This can be handled very simply by waiting a bit before actually starting to speak. So simple? Yes and no: Yes, just by waiting (just half a second) you will automatically reduce saying those things. No, because you're dealing with other persons too, and there's the catch: generally you start saying things like "eh", "heu", ... when you are in a hurry starting speaking, and this is regularly caused by the other people around you: the people around you are used that you start speaking quite quickly, so in order to say something they are doing this very quickly, and before you realise you end up in a speaking contest, and the one who is the first to start talking, wins the contest. In other words, when you wait, even for just half a second, you might end up loosing every speaking contest. I propose you to start experimenting with the waiting thing outside of the daily speaking contests, e.g. you are in a meeting, you mention that you want to say something (e.g. by raising your hand), and while everybody is expecting you to say something, you do the waiting trick and then you start speaking. Be aware, this is very difficult: everybody is expecting you to say something and instead of starting to speak, you remain silent for half a second. (I've been there, I know how hard it is) But you'll soon find out that that half a second is not that long, and once you speak more fluently you'll earn more respect from the people around the table, and that confidence will stimulate you to go on with the waiting trick. Good luck and keep us informed about your progress 

Should you not get any information on this person (even the information allowing you doing some research), be honest about it and ask them to tell something about themselves. You can do the same. 

you want to work for company A (starting date unknown, salary acceptable, location excellent) but use contract from company B to improve the salary you want to start working ASAP and company B comes in handy (known starting date, excellent salary, acceptable location) you want to work for company A at all costs (you don't mind waiting, you accept the salary) 

Why don't you have some sections on your resume, like "occupational experience" where you state company B, and later on something like "other activities / voluntary work" where you state company A, giving the time frames of the activities you performed. For someone doing an extensive background check this would seem as: 

Please, don't take it personally, but it seems like you have some sort of disability (you took the trouble of finding a medical explanation for your condition). If you were missing a limb, you'd be provided with some assistive tools, if you were having chronic back problems you'd receive more ergonomic workplace, wouldn't you? I see the following choices: 

Long story short - company A is not flawless here - they shed a considerable amount of uncertainty. Use this as the reason for walk-away message if you chose for option 1 or 2. But if you hear "then go", do your best and not look at company B as a punishment. I with you to make a satisfactory choice. 

I'd say, you have two options: either you stay or either you go. When you want to go, I'm advising you to get a career coach because, honestly, saying you have picked up pieces of knowledge and being MCSA(ish), not one single employer will hire you when you say it like this. When you want to stay, there are several thing which need to change, because at first sight your MD has a point: I read from your question that you work as a support IT engineer. This means that, in case something goes wrong with the IT equipment, you're the one who needs to solve the issues. Regularly something goes wrong with that equipment, due to third-party errors, and you believe this gets you off the hook (I didn't cause the error, so I'm innocent). I'm really sorry but it does not work like that: as a support engineer it's not your job to explain why things are not working. It's your job to get them working, despite the errors! How can you achieve this? I propose you to do a monitoring of the equipment (diskspace, network connections, regular diagnostics, ...), so you can act pro-actively (I once contacted a user of a server about one of the file-systems being at more than 95%, he was astonished that I was monitoring his machine, and on another occasion I had a user who didn't want to do something about it, so I contacted my direct boss saying that if anything would go wrong with the server, the responsibility was up to that user, you can't believe the speed the user changed his attitude). Stop working too long without getting paid. Ok, you might need some time to set up the diagnostics I just mentioned, but as far as the updates and utilities are concerned: Ok you do that during the night and you come to work in the morning just in case there is an issue, but you must be able to take a leave for recuperating the hours you worked during the night. Good luck 

As I have been in similar situation, I can tell you what I've done then. If the offer seemed reasonable (work environment, industry branch, commute time) I had attended the interview, provided that it hadn't collided with my then current work and other tasks. I gained quite some interview experience, I also got an idea on what the employers (in most cases they were intermediaries) expect from software developers. After some time I knew that my situation was not that bad as I thought and possible gains of switching to the new employer would not pay off the effort of leaving the current (suddenly leaving the on-going projects, changing the retirement plan and insurances, etc. and starting off at the new project). Still, I managed to slightly grow my network, which paid off later. There is a saying in the country where I live - the neighbour's lawn is always greener. The offers you receive now may seem great on paper, but once you go through an interview, you get completely different point of view. But if you don't, you keep on living with the idea of much better position (though unverified) elsewhere. TL;DR; If you have time and feel like, attend the interviews (provided you don't sacrifice your current responsibilities). If you are happy with what you have now and you're not looking for a change, respond with "Thank you for your offer. I'm not interested in new challenges at the moment. Should my situation change, I'd gladly reach out to you." 

My current direct manager. I don't care for him, but I'd like to avoid giving the opportunity to harm me. My second level manager (which is the same as the one from the previous department): when he proposed me to change department, he clearly confirmed that in case the new task would not suit me, I could go back to my previous task. The CTO (Chief Technical Officer): I've told him (about a month ago) that the new job is a challenge, now I will need to tell him it's not just a challenge, it's a disaster, but I don't like bringing bad news to one of the bosses of the company (the company is led by three brothers, the CTO being one of them). My previous direct manager. When he heard about my leaving for that other department, he tried to stop me (but I didn't understand his advise at that moment, now I do). I believe he would like to have me back (but how well can you know your direct manager after only six months, in a department of Â±20 people?). 

I don't get anything done here (really nothing), so why would he listen to an employee who has nothing to show for? We have complete different characters, which can lead to two possible situations: 2.1. We talk about our differences and learn from each other. 2.2. We drift away and start disliking each other. 

I believe there is nothing wrong in asking "what do you mean by..." if the topic is really unclear. Also concluding their ideas by "if I understood you correctly, you mean..." or "just for my understanding, ...". To avoid fuss refrain from making statements like "I don't understand what you mean", rather ask open questions instead giving the other party the possibility to share their thoughts. In the beginning it may seem as it is you, who has problems with understanding your colleague, but as the times go, they will develop the ways of communication leading to the situation that you don't need to ask additional questions. Anyway, it is not something that will happen immediately, it will be a process. Have patience, act proactively. Good luck! 

If you're not willing to talk to the management, ear protection (with some note on your desk explaining why) is the solution. I know about the following: 

Perhaps this is the reason for the meeting - to see whether this consultant is suitable for your problem? Do you have the name of this person? Can you Google/LinkedIn them? 

Ask your boss if there is/will be an NDA signed before the meeting. If so, you can share sensitive information. 

You seem to have pretty normal questions concerning the meeting - why not ask them to your boss? Try to arrange a short (quarter to half an hour) meeting with your boss where you clarify your doubts. Or send them by email if the availability of your boss is scarce.
