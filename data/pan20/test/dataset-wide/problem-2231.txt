1500m a day seems a very short distance. My ten year old swims 3500 to 4000m each evening as part of her training. When I was competing in inter-county swimming races in my late teens, I would swim about 5k each evening, and another 1500m each morning. And while I was pretty fast in my county, I was never going to be up at the speed professionals swim At risk of stating the obvious, when you use arms and legs you go much faster than arms or legs alone. This is perfectly normal. 

Distance to Finish (DTF) is the simplest and most common way to measure distance in sailing. If you take a Great Circle line (the shortest distance on the surface of the Earth) between the boat and the next mark, buoy or finish, that is the DTF. Once round the next mark, the measurement starts again to the following one. It isn't an accurate indicator of who will actually be in the lead, as it doesn't take into account course made good over tides, winds, upwind sailing capability etc., until the boats are close to the mark/buoy/finish line. Because of this, commentators typically provide analysis based on expectations of positions, and this is especially valuable for long distance races such as the Vendée Globe. They take into account known weather patterns, sea conditions etc. From the Volvo Ocean Race site (emphasis mine): 

The generally accepted solution is to accept that this will happen - you can minimise the risk by kicking the board backward when you bail, but most skaters would rather damage the board than accidentally get hooked up with a leash in traffic, or trip on the leash when trying to bail at speed etc. Boards are meant to take dings anyway. That said, there are some situations when you might want one, so you can use a leash (a little like a surfer's leash, but tightly coiled so it won't go under the trucks, hopefully) but you will look silly and will get harassed by other skaters :-) There was someone who invented a 'dead man's brake' that would stop a longboard quite quickly if your foot came off it, but it didn't catch on. 

I'm going to assume you're asking about MLB Rules. The main rule covering this is 5.09 (b)(7) and the definition of FOUL BALL is also relevant. 

The batter received a ball and remained at home plate. Since the batter has not become a runner, there is no force play. Ball is not dead and runners may move to another base at their own risk. Runners need to be tagged out. 

Because this question is not about the actual play, but instead the call and response to it, there's just nothing in the rule book to help. There may be some umpiring documents that would be relevant, but I have no access to them. So instead I'll give a rationalization based on the principle of "what would probably have happened if the screwup didn't occur" (similar to how fan interference is dealt with). The proper initial call would have been that the outfielder did not complete the catch, and that the ball is live. The runner on third was not tagging up and would have easily trotted home. An argument could be made that the runner on second could have scored as well, but the conservative arrangement is to give all runners one base. The actions of any player after the out was signaled are irrelevant. The runner on third only went back because of the incorrect "out" signal. An MLB article by Gregor Chisholm mentions that because this was a replay overturn, the specifics of what to do with the runners were handled by the replay officials, not the on-field crew. 

I was watching the two big games in the Champions League this week and both of the games were spoiled by the red cards (the card in the City-Barca game was a clear red as it was a clear clear goal scoring opportunity whereas the Arsenal-Bayern game was not so clear cut). It got me thinking; 1: when was the rule around clear goal scoring opportunities introduced and 2: was there a case that made them introduce it? I'm thinking something like when they clamped down on tackles from behind because it was this kind of tackle that forced Marco Van Basten into early retirement or Lampard's goal in the 2010 World Cup which got a debate on goal line technology going. 

The first ever transfer was Willie Groves to Aston Villa in 1893 for £100. This was after player registration was introduced in 1885 by the FA making it possible for a player to play for a club only after he had been registered with them. Just out of interest that sum of £100 would now be worth £10881.81 taking inflation into account. 

Italy used to use a playoff for league winners, european spots, relegation if two teams were level on points for the same position. This was before the 05/06 season, since then they have used head to head records to decide league standings between teams on level points. 

Gymnasts are also usually quite small, there is actually some debate over whether gymnastics can affect growth (but I don't think there is much evidence behind this). According to this website American gold medalist Gabrielle Douglas is 

But if you have a large swell or rough seas in a light wind, leaving the vang too loose will let your boom bounce up and down, so pull it in enough to stop that happening. 

This gives more power, as the sail flattens, and the mast bends, but be ready to slacken it off as the sail overpowers. That basic rule, having your vang tension proportional to the wind strength is an excellent approximation. This allows the sail more power - which is what you want control of in racing. It would be ideal if the helmsman could also work the vang, because you can play the helm, main sheets and vang off against each other, but on a 2 person boat you'd usually have your crew play the vang. Edit: Just found a brief page from Dave Dellenbaugh (an America's Cup veteran) that gives a little more detail on these. 

So, as no-one has answered, I thought I'd pop up some of the info I found in my research. It doesn't seem to matter much whether the leader continues or whether you swap leads, however leading for a couple of pitches and then swapping may get your hand in with placing anchors on that climb. Weigh this up against fatigue. The key piece for all multi-pitch climbs is rope handling at each belay point - this is where some additional techniques and practices come into play: From Petzl's guidance: 

If you have identified your ideal heart rate for the distance you are running, and use a monitor in training then it makes sense to use it in a race - it helps you to keep from getting caught up in the race spirit and pushing too hard (especially useful in longer distance runs) I used to just use my feeling and a known running cadence, which worked for most marathons, but for my last Paris Marathon I got over excited early on and ruined my time by overdoing it. Since then I would swear by a monitor. 

Also they can't use their social media to promote sponsorships or advertisements. This next quote is probably the most important and interesting part of it as it seems to be the downfall of most footballers when they tweet! 

That interview was from around 2013, I believe he is open to the idea of it being used at Euro 2016. FIFA seem to have the seem view of the issue. Some pundits and ex-footballers believe it would also slow down the flow of the game but the main reason for it not being implemented seems to be financial and logistical. I would guess that we will say goal line technology being used in only major tournaments such as the World Cup and major leagues like the English Premier League where the technology is currently being used. Here is an interesting article on Fifa's attitude towards it. 

Essentially it hasn't been introduced by UEFA because the top brass don't support it because of the financial cost. Platini says: 

From what I have read and heard he was released because his knee made him a liability. On this forum the fans talk about it said that Paule Le Guen deemed he was surplus to requirements at Rangers and that Andrews was afraid to take a medical at Reading in case he failed it as it would look bad when he was trying to find a new club. I didn't see any interview where he gave a reason behind his release but the amount of injuries he suffered must have made up Rangers' mind about releasing him in 2006. 

No. Bert is still entitled to 2nd base (there is no force). So there are no outs to be made on home plate or third (or on first). They need to throw to second. 5.06(a)(2) tells us that the following runner (Adam in your example) would be out if tagged, if both Adam and Bert are on second. 

There are three exceptions listed, but none of them apply in this case since the out at third base is not a force. The MLB rulebook also contains an Approved Ruling scenario that is very similar. 

"swarm" in this case suggests the convergent movement of the defense to the ball or ball-carrier. This is to emphasize the role of all teammates in the play, not just the one nearest the ball. To "stick" suggests a well-executed tackle, where the defender reaches and stays with the ball carrier. This is in contrast to a poor tackle where contact is made but the player bounces off or scrambles free. 

The sources I used probably predated the Rams move to L.A. and did not mention their current (2017) usage of the L.A. Coliseum. I missed that one and as GB11 points out, there's no team logo there. As the new Los Angeles stadium is also planned to be used by two teams. We'll have to wait for the opening to see if it will be similar to Metlife or if they have something else in mind. 

When defining the conditions for a legal offensive formation and for receiver eligibility, there is no mention of where the ball is located. The eligible receivers need to be on the ends, not covered, and wearing appropriate numbers (they are here) and appropriate numbered ineligible receivers must be found between them (also true). It's just that for this play, the ball is snapped by one of the eligible receivers on the end, instead of one of the ineligible receivers in the middle. Handling the snap does not make the player ineligible, or make the formation illegal. See the NCAA Football Rulebook 7-1-4-a (FR-72) for requirements of the offensive formation and 7-3-3 (FR-76) for receiver eligibility. 

There is a good answer on yahoo for it. Basically it varies from country to country because of the co-efficient system UEFA uses, England, Spain and Germany all have clubs entering into Europe because of how their teams have performed over the last few years in Europe. UEFA did introduce the rule about winners of the cups going to the Europa League to give teams more incentive in the domestic cups. Regarding Man Utd in 2008, they beat Spurs in the final and spurs would have already qualified through their league position so in that case it goes to the 7th placed team. Stoke were entered into the UEFA cup when they finished runners up because they were outside the top 6 in the league that year. 

I know that on the Barclays premier league site there is a fantasy football game and they award points for an assist on corners and that is the official site for the Premier League. I always see this on sites like Goal.com as well where assists are awarded for corners. 

La Liga and the Copa Del Rey are considered separate competitions, Ronaldo recently picked up a 3 game ban in La Liga against Bilbao but was able to play (and score) in the semi finals against Atl. Madrid. 

Longest additional time: 12 minutes 58 seconds (Arsenal v. West Ham United, 23 January 2013) Here is the match report for the game from the Guardian. The time added on was due to an injury to the West Ham player Potts.
