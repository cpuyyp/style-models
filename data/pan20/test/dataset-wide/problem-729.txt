Overall everything is just a bit more fiddly to adjust and get setup right and goes out of adjustment quicker: pedals, pre-cartridge bottom brackets, headsets. Steel is a nice frame material though, better than today's mid range aluminium bikes. I've got another retro race bike which I fitted with fattish tires. It came from a dumpster and I use it to ride our bike thief infested streets. 

At 10 o'clock there is a wedge that holds the handlebar. Taking off the plastic cap at the end of the stem reveals the bolts for tightening the stem and handlebar. 

There is no limit to safe downhill speed on your bike. The limit is when you come off your bike. In which case even a low speed crash of 20 to 30 mph can be pretty nasty on chip and seal type surfaces or where there are obstacles (oncoming traffic anyone?). You can ride a modern road bike up to 60 mph, even a little more but I would say that it is not safe to ride at that speed with nothing but spandex and a lightweight crash helmet. 

If you are feeling physically worn out by the commute and you are not used to, well, you are just tiring yourself out and not allowing you muscles to recover between rides. Keep riding and your body will eventually adapt. Maybe you want to do this commute every other day for a while, or at a slower pace to help you your body strengthen itself. Simply riding will build strength and endurance. Doing some body weight core exercises will probably help stabilize you torso and let your legs work efficiently. 

When truing a wheel (such that the rim lies in a plane perpendicular to the axle) it is only necessary to measure against one side of the rim, as rims have a uniform width around their circumference (assuming there are no dents in the sidewall. The other aspect of wheel geometry is correct dish (rim lies in a plane exactly halfway between the axle shoulders). Another question here indicates that the Park TS 2.2 needs calibrating to achieve correct dish. I believe most wheel builders use a separate dishing tool to ensure dish is correct. 

I'd say get any cheap thumb shifter. Much easier to operate than grip+twist shifter. Click down is very easy. Shift up requires a firm push with the thumb. My daughter when learning to shift gears had a big problem. She's a tough cookie but more delicate hands than average and the twist shifts were just too stiff. You don't notice this with big strong adult hands. We replaced her twist shift with cheap thumb shift and it made a huge difference. Also make sure gear cable is well oiled and moves smoothly and derailleurs cleaned and oiled for smooth operation. 

It's over politically-correct to say "you cannot do it" or "you have to ask permission". I find that it's not really that possible to chat / ask permission. I don't think it is rude. Most cyclists do not mind. You might exchange a word if you stop at traffic lights. Depending on relative speed and road situation common sense (ahum sometimes not that common maybe but not all that uncommon either!) is a good guide. There's a long steady uphill section on my commute home mostly with mixed on-road and shared foot/cycle path. I often find I'm riding at the same pace as other cyclists so drafting happens somewhat naturally. I don't find that taking turns happens at all much. On SAFETY(some of the common sense): you have to be HYPER-aware of what is coming up in front as well as road situation all around/behind (as usual!). You cannot draft right on wheel expecting signals as in road racing. It is an informal arrangement! When drafting like this I try to be of safety BENEFIT to the cyclist in front. You can back off frequently and give space as the cyclist in front encounters hazards, move to the side to look in front and behind, signal to front and behind and look after both yourself and others. I generally have flashing lights on and I have a bell :-) and I find riding as a pair like this is better for safety against car traffic. Also, I don't know is this just Dublin, Ireland, but many cyclists don't have(illegal here) or use bells. I find the tinkle of a bell + voice from well back mostly gives enough warning to pedestrians/dog walkers/other hazards(:-)). Warning enough that multiple cyclists can pass in a friendly way as opposed to all coming to a grumpy slow halt or blazing past close by in a dangerous manner. I find I might be the only one sometimes in group of 4/5 that will offer a tinkle! 

Modern carbon fiber composite frames don't actually have to make a trade off between strength, durability and weight. The properties of modern carbon fiber composites are such that a bike built to enough strength will still be lighter than a metal frame and also possess superior durability because carbon fiber composites have better fatigue resistance than metal frames, apparently including titanium (and I suspect they are vastly superior to aluminum). long term exposure to UV radiation and heat can weaken epoxies, but there have been improvements in UV radiation resistance in the epoxy resins and paint finishes. What carbon fiber is susceptible to is concentrated force in a small area, which can crack or damage the epoxy matrix. Source: $URL$ If you want to convince yourself you should look on YouTube for videos of the punishing testing manufacturers put carbon frames through and see how well they withstand it. 

New chain is the right length? The new chain should have the same number of links as the old chain. Did you line up old and new chain (allowing for wear so the line-up will be asymmetrical!) and put on new chain with the same number of links? I used this recently: $URL$ OFTEN rear derailleur can get a bit twisted or bent. You were riding in the forest and chain snapped. Might you have bumped something? :-) Especially your rear derailleur is exposed to bashing off things when mountain-biking. Check does your rear derailleur cog line up correctly with your rear cogs? Applying some gentle brute force in the right place on the rear derailleur can help. This is very good: $URL$ Check something in your drive chain. I got a notch in my front derailleur which chews and snaps chain! So check front and back drive-train. Is your back wheel aligned correctly also?
