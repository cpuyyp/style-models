Since upright rows stress the traps and the shoulders, I would switch to using barbell or dumbbell shrugs. Your shoulders won't get as much work, but, if done correctly, the traps should benefit. Additionally, either exercise should reduce any strain on your wrists. 

The rotator cuff is collection of four tendons and muscles. Most people don't target them until they've had some form of injury to the area. They are typically exercised using bands, towels, cables, stretches, and very light weights. If you've had previous problems with your rotator cuff, it's not a bad idea to warm up first. Make sure to perform any exercise with strict form. If you currently have problems with the RC, you should seek the advice of a physical therapist. 

(Blast fat exercise machines) If you decide to try a rower, make sure to get proper instruction. Learning how to use a rower correctly will help you avoid injury and allow you to gain full benefit from the machine. 

I’m a firm believer in making sure to remove any unnecessary movements that would otherwise affect my technique/form. I think that’s important to reduce any risk of form break or injury. And, extra movements tend to reduce the impact on the targeted muscles. For example, while doing barbell curls, I don’t bend at the waist and swing the bar up. In my opinion, there’s no added benefit to engaging extra muscles if I’m targeting the biceps. Since your grip is important for maintaining proper form, I would resist the urge to push or pull the bar especially if you progress to heavier weights. I don’t see any added benefit to it, and, it can only lead to bad habits. 

First off, it's hard to quantify the exact amount of recovery time on an individual basis. There are many factors that will affect recovery including genetics, nutrition, training status (newbie vs. experienced), sleep, fatigue, etc. While it is generally accepted that the recommended guideline for recovery is 48-72 hours, it is only a guideline. Individual rates of recovery vary depending on some of the factors I've indicated. In their paper, Recovery in Training: The Essential Ingredient , doctors Jonathan N. Mike, M.S. and Len Kravitz, Ph.D. Explain: 

(my emphasis) While the free squat is arguably the better movement, the study results do not imply that there is no benefit to performing machine squats. It simply says that for some muscles, free squats are better. Machines do have a place in training, but, are often dismissed based solely on perpetuated opinions. Rather than dismissing a machine outright, I would suggest using them on those occasions when a piece of equipment is not available, you don't have a spotter, or, simply to switch things up to keep the training fresh. As for the different feel to machine squats, there are many variations of the squat (eg. split squat) that can be performed to provide an effective workout. And, if you're dealing with lower back pain, machine squats can provide a sense of security because the movement is restricted and there's less likelihood that you'll injure yourself further. 

I share the same profession as you and have the same concerns. My advice would be to avoid computer eye strain by taking frequent breaks from the screen. I’ve been advised to get up from the pc every twenty minutes, or so. Frequent breaks give your eyes a chance to relax and reduces the strain. I’ve found that setting a regular schedule for breaks helps so that I know when to get up. The See Clearly Method & Other Programs: Do Eye Exercises Improve Vision? 

Changing the order of exercises that fit your schedule should not cause any problems. In fact, as you progress you should find yourself constantly ‘tweaking’ your routine for various reasons. Once you’ve established your training goals, changing exercises, the order of exercises, training days, reps, and sets will assist you in combating boredom and training plateaus. A natural progression would be to split your exercises per the type of work/goal(s). For example, Push/Pull. As a beginner, it’s more important to be consistent and build a good foundation before moving on to more advanced training methodologies. That also means giving yourself enough time to rest. So, keeping weekends free is not a bad thing. 

Unfortunately, you've discovered one of the risks of training alone. And, while Alec's answer may be a start, asking someone who “looks” experienced is no guarantee that you will reduce the risk of injury. For example, let's assume you ask an “experienced” person to spot you. They won't be familiar with your training and what you expect from a spot. Even explaining it to them leaves it open to interpretation. And, then there's the matter of timing. If your spotter's timing does not coincide with what you expect, your chance for injury may rise. A better approach would be to train with a partner who knows what you expect. While this is still not a perfect solution, having a partner that understands your goals and what you expect from each lift should reduce the risk of injury. If a partner is not available, there's one more solution that could lower your injury risk. Assuming a bench press lift, I would try using a smith machine since it has inherent spotting capabilities built into the design. And, while the Smith Machine has some disadvantages, one advantage is the ability to perform a lift without a spotter. 

Associations of sitting behaviours with all-cause mortality over a 16-year follow-up: the Whitehall II study While there seems to be confusion and a lack of consensus, I would suggest, from my own experience, that using a rower for an extended piece certainly does not qualify as a lack of movement, or, energy expenditure. And, while other studies suggest that sitting is harmful even with exercise, in my opinion, given the lack of consensus, there needs to be a more complete study that examines exercise and its potential to counteract any harmful effects of sitting as it applies to a pattern of sedentary behavior. 

That's followed by “The Basics of Weight Training” which provides all aspects of training including goals, equipment, specific exercises, designing routines, nutrition and much more. The book contains illustrations of all the mentioned exercises and includes a “workbook” at the end for designing a routine and tracking your progress. Two other books that may be of interest were written by three time Mr. Olympia Frank Zane. Known as the "Zen" bodybuilder, Frank was not your typical bodybuilder as he stressed symmetry and pleasing proportionals over total mass. His books stress exercise programs, nutrition, psychology, dreams, meditation, motivation, and inspiration. The two I would recommend are Mind, Body, Spirit and The Zane Way to a Beautiful Body.
