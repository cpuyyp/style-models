Look at any classic bodybuilding book or DVD and it will say free weights are superior to cables (and machines) for muscular hypertrophy. Joe Weider and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two famous proponents of this idea. Their claim is that humans have evolved to work against gravity and free weights provide a natural gravitational force, while cables do not. I understand how machines are inferior because they don't work stabilizer muscles, but I don't understand how this logic proves cables are suboptimal. A) Evolution Who says humans have evolved to get bigger muscles from working against gravity? If anything, technological advances have made humans work less against gravity over the centuries. We do not toil on the farm like our forefathers. We now have cars, computers, and robots to do heavy lifting for us. B) Contradiction to overload principle Isn't the key to hypertrophy to subject the muscles to ever-increasing unusual stress, thereby making them adapt to this new stress? Bodybuilders know that doing the same routine over and over make their muscles become complacent. Since cables provide a force that is unlike the gravity we deal with every waking moment of our lives, then wouldn't cables stress the muscles more than free weights? 

Here are the nutrition facts of red and white quinoa from the same company. The main differences I can see are that red quinoa is slightly lower in total fat, marginally higher in sodium, fiber, sugar, and protein, vitamin E, riboflavin, and folate. Their amino acid profiles are pretty similar (they are both complete proteins). Just because red quinoa has less fat doesn't make it necessarily healthier (saturated and trans fats are the ones potentially implicated in health problems, and they're the same in both types of quinoa). Foods high in fiber and vitamins promote health, so red quinoa is slightly superior to white quinoa on those fronts. High sodium diets can increase risk of high blood pressure and high sugar diets can increase risk of diabetes, but even though red quinoa has slightly more of both, neither type of quinoa would be considered high in sodium or sugar. If you're a strict vegetarian, red quinoa would be a little better than white to help you meet your protein needs, but meat eaters generally have no trouble meeting their protein requirements. I'd say red quinoa is marginally healthier, but really, if you like white quinoa better, they're about the same. 

You may want to read up on Basal animal metabolic rate for more tips on increasing your metabolism. From personal experience, weight lifting to increase muscle mass has given boosted my metabolism through the roof. In the first 6 months of weight lifting, I dropped a pant size, yet gained 10 lbs of lean mass. Muscle burns a ton of calories just to maintain. The more ripped you are, the more calories you burn just by sitting. 

Why does the eccentric contraction increase DOMS, but not the concentric contraction? From the Wikipedia article, it appears that the eccentric contraction uses a very different mechanical process and is fueled by different nutrients. I recall watching a video on Intructional Fitness saying that workouts with extremely prolonged eccentric contractions cause DOMS, not the day after the workout, but actually two days after the workout. Nutrition I'm not an expert on how nutrition affects DOMS, but I've read in numerous places that eating branch chain amino acids reduces DOMS by repairing muscle faster. BCAAs are found in most high end protein powders. 

So you don't have to be a total freak about reducing saturated fat. The FDA suggests that no more than 10% of your daily Calories come from saturated fat (~20g in a 2000 Cal diet--a gram of fat yields 9 Cal) and the American Heart Foundation suggests no more than 7%. 

BCAA stands for branched-chain amino acids. According to this article, from the Journal of Nutrition: 

Accordingly the study found that sitting on an exercise ball instead of a chair was related to spinal shrinkage. Since the psoas major originates from the lumbar vertebrae, it may be compensating for the extra strain on the low back. My advice would be to nix the exercise ball and go for an office chair designed by ergonomic specialists, but if you want to keep using the ball, this article offers some decent tips, such as: 

Which bodybuilder should I believe? Jay Cutler is a far more successful bodybuilder than Hunter Labrada because Jay has been Mr. Olympia 4 times, but both guys look much better than I'd ever hope to be. 

The majority of fitness experts suggest eating carbohydrates right after a workout to replenish depleted muscle glycogen stores. Arnold Schwarzenegger even went as far as saying the window of opportunity for utilizing carbohydrates is even tighter for carbs than protein in his Modern Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. Why must one rush to restore muscle glycogen? You're not going to be doing any strenuous activity after working out that requires maxed out glycogen stores. Usually, your next workout is at least 24 hours away, giving you a chance to eat multiple carb heavy meals before then. 

It doesn't matter exactly what your arms and legs are doing in dead bug, as long as you do a variation that's easy enough that you can keep your low back pressed into the floor. With all else equal, I'd say the easiest option is to have one foot on the floor with the knee bent while the other one lowers (first option from the second video), because in that position, the bent leg helps support the neutral position of the pelvis. The medium option is to have one leg straight up above the hips while the other one lowers (second option from the second video), because the leg that is up is stacked straight above the pelvis so it doesn't contribute much forward-tilting torque to the pelvis. The hardest option is to have one knee bent at 90-90 while the other lowers (first video), because now both legs are contributing to forward-tilting torque on the pelvis. You have to keep the bent knee above the hips though, if you bring it in toward the chest you lose that torque. In any of these positions, only lower the leg down as far as you can keep the lower back pressed into the floor. If you can do all of these variations without arching your back at all, the next step up is to do exercises in which you lower both legs, such as this one. In this video they add another variation you can incorporate into dead bug with the head and shoulder lifted. This engages the upper abs, and helps keep the rib cage in a neutral position, which in turn prevents the low back from arching. 

The answer can be found in the "No Sex Before Sports" episode of Manswers. Here is a summary of that video: The assistant coach of the LA Avengers tells his players to abstain from sex the night before a game because late night sex can take away hours from sleep. Adequate sleep is necessary for good athletic performance. David Baron, M.D. Physician, says that higher testosterone levels give better coordination, reflexes, and spatial coordination - traits for good athletic performance. He says testosterone levels are NOT affected by sex. David says sex will generally only burn 50 calories and will not wear out an athlete before a game. David quotes Canadian physician Ian Shryder on his report that there was absolutely no effect of sex before a big game. 

Trans fat only occurs naturally in a few food sources, and at very low levels (Health Canada). If a food is high in trans fat, the trans fat there on purpose (e.g. processed foods use trans fats to improve texture, increase shelf life, etc.). If a scientist's focus is saturated and unsaturated fat, and if food intake could be carefully controlled (such as in animal studies), they probably wouldn't include foods high in trans fat at all. For example, this study from 1990 compares soybean oil-based and lard-based rat food, neither of which contain trans fat. Even before we knew the health effects of trans fat, including it in one group but not another would be an obvious confounding factor. I would say any older animal or in vitro studies haven't lost any validity. Studies on humans have to be epidemiological for ethical reasons, so it's harder to control for trans fat (and a whole lot of other things), especially since many processed foods are high in both saturated and trans fat. Evidence from epidemiological studies is usually combined with animal and in vitro to support for conclusions about causation, so these findings are a little sketchy to start out with. This study re-evaluated a bunch of older epidemiological studies to better control for various confounding factors. It found no link between reducing saturated fat intake and reduced risk for heart disease and stroke in humans. So maybe saturated fats aren't damaging our bodies as actively as we once thought. From a practical standpoint though, even though saturated fats may not hurt your health, they are not thought to actively help it, whereas polyunsaturated fats are thought to decrease risk of heart disease and stroke (based on in vitro, animal, and epidemiological studies). If you increase your intake of polyunsaturated fats without decreasing your intake of saturated fats, you'll increase your total caloric intake, which would increase your risk of obesity and other associated health risks. So, even if saturated fat is benign, I would still argue that it makes sense to cut back on it to make more room in your diet for polyunsaturates. 

We have tons of squat variations to work the quadriceps and glutes, but I've never seen a free weight exercise to really work the hamstrings. It seems like hamstring isolation is only possible on a leg curl machine. Machines don't work the stabilizer muscles, so a free weight variation would be more complete. 

Why does he change his hours of sleep depending on the season? By sleeping 8-9 hours in the off-season, Jay Cutler is somewhere in the "long sleepers" range according to this poster. Is he putting on unnecessary fat as the poster says or does the poster only apply to sedentary people? 

On the page linked above, they also suggest sports and activities to avoid, as well as activities that are good for people with lower back problems. 

I couldn't find a site that actually explains these equations, but I can make some educated guess about the rationale behind them. The first term probably gives you a an estimate of body fat based on a couple circumference measurements. However, this estimate lacks precision and accuracy, so it needs to be corrected. The second term probably corrects for height (so that tall people don't get punished for have proportionate girths), and the last term is probably an experimentally-justified constant that corrects the result of the equation to it's as close as possible to actual body fat levels. If you check out the first term, you can see that waist and waist/hip measurements are used to estimate body fat of men and women respectively. This makes sense since these areas correspond to primary areas of fat deposition for each sex. You'll also notice that neck circumference is actually subtracted, so it makes sense that gaining more girth in your neck than your waist would cause a decrease in estimated body fat. I think neck circumference is being used to correct for your lean body mass so you don't get punished for having big muscles and bones. Maybe this is because necks don't usually have that much fat. The underlying assumption seems to be: if you have a larger neck girth, you have more muscle, bigger bones, etc., which shouldn't be counted as fat. If your neck circumference increases more than your waist circumference, the assumption is that the increase in your waist was due to muscle, not fat. If the method is accurate within 3%, it must work pretty well for most people, but there are obvious ways the results could be skewed. For example, if a male only did exercises that beefed up his neck without adding much muscle to his torso, the equation would probably underestimate his body fat. Or, if a female had muscular thighs, but a weaker upper body and neck (typical of runners and dancers), the equation might overestimate her body fat. People with uncharacteristic fat distribution would also have skewed results. 

I've heard the concept of "genetic potential" thrown around when referring to bodybuilding. They say that people are hardwired to reach certain size. I have the following questions regarding this elusive concept. Scientific validity Have scientists singled out the gene that determines the genetic potential a person's muscles? Or is the concept purely based off observation from the bodybuilding community? Plateau How can you differentiate between hitting a plateau and hitting your genetic potential? Should a person who's been unsuccessfully trying to break a plateau for over a year give up because it's not really a plateau but rather a genetic brick wall? Hard Limit? Is the limit a hard limit? For example, the gene says one person's upper arm circumference will not exceed 26 inches no matter what. Or is it a ballpark limit? That is, a person will struggle to get past the suggested limit, but will have an exponentially harder time going past that limit.
