While it looks clever, I have some doubts that it will work efficiently for any real rain. As soon as the brush is "saturated" with water, incoming drops will cause some of already collected water to detach and continue its way up. It will definitely not work for snow, the reason being the snow is hard not liquid. I had my rear wheel fully blocked many times when a build-up of snow formed in the chainstay-seattube-bottom bracket area of my bikes. Even a rear fender placed too low once caused such snow accumulation resulting in inability to rotate the rear wheel. Placing another hinder somewhere can only shift the position of such build-up or even provoke it. Maybe some oil on tires might help to repel snow sticking to the tire, but obviously the same oil will hurt your braking capabilities to the extent that it will be safer to leave the bike home. However, you may try to use some bike polish on the frame and on the drivetrain parts. It is told to help with preventing mud sticking to the frame; however, I used it and did not notice any measurable effects. Solutions that I consider to work are: 

Why produce a heavy but durable carbon frame if one can have a heavy and durable steel frame that is cheaper? Apparently there are no (mass) buyers for such technology. The bicycle industry is mainly driven by the competitive cycling needs, whether it is good or bad for a regular consumer. The choice of frame material is driven by the material properties and many adjacent tradeoffs, such as durability/weight. The resulting product price is closer to the end of the list in competitive disciplines. The product will not be initially mass-marketed in any case, which would drive its price even higher, but who cares. At any point in time, current technology advancements dictate the sport's favorite frame material. Movement from steel to better steel, then to aluminum alloys and then to carbon was caused by that. If tomorrow someone invents how to make a frame from weightless forcefields, it would quickly replace carbon in sport. The consumer market is more driven by a mixture of price and fashion trends, in no particular order. What is deemed to be well sold, will be produced. What does not look like a marketable thing, will only stay at bike expos and end up in museums. Apparently there is no need for carbon frames that are heavy — there are already steel frames. Besides, what's wrong with modern consumer grade carbon anyway? Its advantages and weaknesses are well known, and, if used properly, carbon has no life length limitation. 

Just an update on this topic: I have now checked what is available on the market and realised (as we have discussed previously here) that the easiest way to achieve my goal is changing the calipers to post mount. I am not sure if I could build an adapter to use flat mount calipers on post mount frames, but this would mean putting the caliper farther from the rotor, affecting the positioning of it. There might be as well another problem, that the natural curve of the rotor would not fit on a flat mount caliper used as post mount. I hope this is useful (for somebody) and please let me know if you have any other question. Paolo 

I have a set of Miche reflex wheels. I would like to use them for a single speed conversion project on a Peugeot frame. can I use a 10sp cog? what I mean is: can I use one of the normal cogs that are on one of my 10 speed campag cassette to do it? This would allow me to use all the gear that I have like: - 10 speed chain (after being shortened) - original 10 speed chainring - one of the 10 speed cogs 

I just bought a 2nd hand salsa El Mariachi frame, that I will start to build this week. Unfortunately when I received it I realized that the previous owner probably has ridden it with the seatpost too high or inserted only a few cm and I noticed that the top of seat tube is deformed, have a look at the picture. Do you think it is safe to ride? or might break? suggestions? 

Yes, normally if a bolt get stuck there are 2 possibilities. 1) in shops often they have bolt extractors; they rip firmly on the bolt and then should be possible to unscrew it. 2)another solution I have found to remove bolts has been using glue. So put the bike of its side, so that you can drop the glue in and stuck the hex key in too, to bond. Leave it to rest and if the glue is strong enough try unscrewing it, to remove it. It worked for me a few times. 

You do not need to remove existing paint. However, it is recommended to use a primer before applying new color layers, and also a clear coat on top of that. I used spray rattle cans (primer, color and clear coat) to repaint a suspension fork on one of my bikes. Not the best tool for a fine paint job, and even that required a couple of attempts to gain the experience to do it right. However, I am satisfied with the result, given that the fork is on a beater bike. Good advices on hand repainting of bicycles can be found here. There are other good web resources that I used to learn about the process. Or, you can leave it to professionals — there certainly are services for quality paint jobs. 

No, they are not, if used in a way they are designed to and regularly checked for health. I think that a proper answer to your question should include statistical information on what percentage of bicycle frames (btw, why only frames? wheels, handlebars etc. break too) break over the time. The reason of a breakage, such as crash or manufacturing defect, should also be taken into consideration. However, I do not possess such information. So instead I want to warn you against being affected by the survival bias effect by only looking at "bad" examples. I want to comment on several points in regard to the video above, or any other bike crash footage. 

It happened to me once that a V-brake pad that sat too low relative to the rim's braking surface literally wedged itself down into the rim at braking. To alleviate this, reposition both pad's position and angle. Always make sure that it clears the tire, because otherwise braking friction will destroy the sidewall in no time. 

EDIT As ojs points out in the comments below, the freehub's width of 7-speed systems mismatches those of 8- to 10-speeds. This means the rear hub/wheel has to be changed as well, in addition to everything listed below. Clearly a cost of such change now would exceed the price of a half new bike. 

I would like to use a set of 105 shifters (10 speed), but I don't have a rear mech yet for them. I would like to purchase a mech that would allow me to use a big cog cassette, like a cyclocross or mtb one. What is the compatibility with other models, like mtb mechs? Thanks in advance 

is it possible to use Shimano 11 speed road shifter with 10 speed hub/cassette? if yes, how? I have a set of Shimano Hydraulic 11 speed shifters but I don't want to upgrade hub to 11 speed. Is it possible to use the shifters in some way? Checking online on compatibility I realized that pull in shifting is quite different between 10 and 11 simano road. Thanks in advance! 

I believe that the answer was easier than all you got there. yes all is easy and compatible. All you needed was a spacer (normally provided) to be placed before the cassette on the hub, to make up for the space remaining. But I see that you have been using it successfully already! 

I would like to go touring using my narrowide chainring, but I would like as well to put a smaller chainring (the infamous Grannie) so that I could have it as a last resort in case of really hard climbs (considering that I will carry a lot of gear while touring for several months). Do you think I will be able to shift gears on the crankset with a front derailler, considering the narrowide chainring? 

Yes, normally if a bolt get stuck there are 2 possibilities. 1) in shops often they have half measures, like 8 1/2, or even 9 if it is particularly damaged. 2)the best solution I have found to remove bolts has been using glue. So put the bike of its side, so that you can drop the glue in the hex key. Leave it to rest and if the glue is strong enough it will remove. It worked for me a few times. 

What you need for drivetrain parts is called "a new groupset" — a name that encompasses all the parts I've mentioned. Converting the rear wheel to a new hub would require a complete wheel rebuild. Oftentimes it means that buying a new complete inexpensive rear wheel would be cheaper. 

It is a known psychological fallacy (sunk costs fallacy) that already having spent too much resources (time, money…) on something that turned out to be a mistake somehow justifies persisting in doing that instead of switching to something else. Because it is irrational, it is hard to use rational logic to persuade. Maybe pointing out that the very feeling is irrational, and that feelings should not be placed before logic and hard data when making certain decisions will help somewhat. Point out that new information obtained later on can and should affect people's reconsidering of past decisions, instead of living in the past. Also, maybe asking on a forum dedicated to psychology will give better results. 

Other factors are less deciding. Inner tubes should be fine. There might be some extra muscle effort needed if you install tubeless-ready tires on a regular rim (or was it the other way around? cannot remember). If your fork does not accept wider tires, you can change the fork. If it is the frame that has too narrow rear wheel clearance, changing it equals practically to obtaining a new bike. Getting new wider wheels is easier, because you'll then have two pairs of nice wheels. Some people use 27.5+ wheels on 29-ers, but if bike geometry is not an empty sound for you, you might consider doing some calculations before going that way. 

I thought I've seen something like this before... so I googled a bit and found traces of this design, apparently deceased. 

Situations when the weight of whole bike + cargo (+ maybe a rider?) is concentrated on a small patch of kickstand's clamp and when a small dynamo clamps the same seatstay are really incomparable. In the first case it's a thousand Newtons of stress applied to a piece that was not supposed to be pressed in that direction, and for dynamo it's about five Newtons and the clamping force. I would say just clamp your dynamo mount with a reasonable torque, or, if you are really paranoid, use a torque-measuring wrench and clamp according to manufacturer specifications. If it turns out to be loose at some point, simply re-tighten it. Steel and aluminum alloy frames could sustain quite a lot of abuse of excessive clamping torque (but there is no need for it in the first place). If you make a mistake and instead of 4 N×m would crank it up to 20 N×m, it will still be OK. But I doubt that you will be able to achieve such huge torque with a typical size 3-6 mm allen key that is most likely used for the operation. If your frame is carbon fiber, then a more accurate approach is recommended, as this material is more sensitive to clamping. However, I am not sure that there are many touring carbon bikes around.
