Mathematically, there is not always a "best." Mathematics allows for many situations where one cannot specify a best. Consider the trivial example of "Real numbers which are less than 2." If I define larger numbers to be better, what's the "best" number? The answer, according to set theory, is that there is no such largest real number less than 2. If I were to take the set of real numbers less than 2, it has no maximum. It's a bit strange, and non-intuitive, but that's how mathematicians have chosen to define sets to operate (the original construction, by the way, is called a Dedekind cut, if you care to look at them). Beyond such mathematics, there is also the issue of moves that are "best" in some circumstances, but very poor in others. Let's say you got a super-computer to crunch all possible chess games, and they found that 1. Nc3 "wins." However, when people try to play this "best possible game," it is recognized that it is notoriously hard to win starting with Nc3 as a human, because some of the lines black can play are full of situations that are hard for white to analyze, but easy for black. Alternatively, you might be particularly good at games starting with 1. e4. Worth noting: whether chess has a winning line is an open problem today. We do have "endgame tables" which contain every possible position with a small number of pieces, along with the "best" move to play at each step. However, even in these tables, there's complexities. For example, very few of these tables can account for any rules which limit the number of moves before a draw occurs. 

Science has always been an empirical discipline. I don't think that would ever change without fundamentally redefining science. Science strives to make predictive statements about the world which can be tested. Science has always been interested in two specific criteria: 

Science is a social creation, tied to politics. However, it seeks to move in the direction of being objective. If you think about the scientific method it consists of: * Identify a null-hypothesis * Suggest an alternate hypothesis * Do a study * Reject the null-hypothesis if the data is supported * Publish. Of these steps, the most politically charged step is "Suggest an alternate hypothesis." Given any imperfect model, there are an infinite number of potential "better" models you can choose from for your alternate hypothesis. There is nothing in the "rules" of science to force you to one hypothesis or another, other than the eventual need to be able to reject the null-hypothesis and accept this new one. Science moves towards objectivity via recursion. Your alternate hypothesis stands until someone else expends the resources to reject it and provide a new hypothesis. The more politically motivated a hypothesis is, the more room it gives for the next scientist to reject it. The limit as "number of experiments" approaches infinity is "objectivity." Accordingly, a large group of politically motivated scientists can influence science by refusing models which violate their politics. If nobody challenges this with an a-political alternative, then politics clearly affects society. Another political issue that can come up is the ability to do work. Rejecting a well entrenched null-hypothesis requires a fair bit of data. If it is expensive to generate that data, the political minority may lack the power to collect the data to reject the politically charged hypothesis. This could come up easily in situations like particle physics, where tests can cost remarkable sums. The theory of science is that, over time, there will be a series of politically-viable-but-undesirable experiments to overthrow any poorly-matching-but-desirable result. This usually stems from the ability to use small scale tests to theorize about the large scale experiments that will be needed, and to find solutions. This is just a theory, it isn't proven. 

(This is going to be way too much opinion... but I'll post it anyways. Feel free to comment) Who says there is a monopoly on progress? There are countless examples where individuals came to two different conclusions, and both called them "progress." This happens all the time throughout history. In the past decades, it has been safe to say that Western culture has a monopoly on progress, because any attempt to progress in a different direction was overshadowed by our progress. After enough attempted failures, other cultures "gave" us the word. If needed, culture will invent a new word to describe something which supersede our "progress." As for modernity... This is more of an opinion question, as the word has many meanings in different groups. From your description, relying on empirical evidence rather than scripture, I can offer my opinion: modernity is the result of trying to describe the world in indisputable terms. All words are subject to linguistics. Modern linguistics suggests that words themselves rarely have a meaning to themselves -- they are defined within the fabric of culture. If the culture is lost or changed, the meanings to words become vague. I like to reference the kashrut rules for grasshoppers, because it is a religious example which is not very conflagory. There are four types of kosher locust: Arbeh, Sa'lam, Chargol, and Chagav. These types were well understood in the time of the Torah's creation, but their meaning has been lost to time. Jews seeking to honor kashrut law are trapped by this loss. Many Rabbinical traditions will forbid eating of any grasshopper, just to be conservative. Others allow the eating of grasshoppers only if they are a traditional food. It isn't simple! This issue is less apparent in non-writtten religions, because the religion is not bound to historical wording the same way a written religion is. A non-written version of Judaism might be free to replace Arbeh with Nomadacris septemfasciata (currently believed to be the most likely species match to Arbeh), but a written religion must hold to the oldest written word. This is both the greatest strength and greatest weakness of a written religion Science seeks to resolve this issue. It identifies the issue to be the connection between the culture and the language. If they could use a language which is universal to all cultures, science could never be misinterpreted. In order to make this work, they were forced to pay a grave price: All scientific language had to be built from repeatable empirical trials. There was no way they could base anything off of a cultural phenomena (such as "virgin birth" or "a flaming bush") which occurred once and nobody can predict if or when it will happen again. Thus science is formed around repeatable experiments. Many of the fundamental ones, such as those needed to comprehend the meaning of "force" or "momentum" can be done on a playground in a few minutes. Others, such as chemical reactions, can be done in a lifetime. One can identify the element we call "sodium" by identifying potential sources of salt (NaCl), and then running them through a battery of tests which are designed to isolate "sodium" from other elements. The purpose of science is to leave behind not only a model of our world, but a set of instructions for which a future civilization could resuscitate our scientific language and leverage the body of our work. 

The article did not say much that is new. The idea that science can define what is ontologically true has always been a faith belief, just like everything which claims to be able to make ontological claims of truth or falsehood. Combine this with quantum physics, which challenges determinism naturally, and it is natural to see the claims he makes. I can only assume that his actual work is more profound than this article makes it seem. It seems his biggest issue is that there must be some limit on omnipotent, omniscient deities a. la. Abrahamic tradition. This sort of issue has been known for centuries, at least as far back as the first time someone asked "Can God create a rock so heavy even he cannot lift it." He seems to have simply come across a new one. I think the big thing he is trying to point out is that, if we assume all of reality is modeled with these "inference engines," that we have to be ready for science to fail to describe at least 1 bit of state in the universe, for no reason other than our current science finds itself naturally organized into inference engine notations. 

What's different here? When the photon hits the detection grid, it is literally unknown what detector its entangled sister will go to. There's a 50% chance that it will go to a detector which reveals which path it took. There's a 50% chance that it goes to a detector that does not reveal anything, "erasing path information." The result? If they filter out only the photons whose sister hit a detector which gave path information, the result was a wide pattern with no interference patterns -- particle behavior. If they filter out only the photons whose sister hit a detector which erased path information, we saw interference patterns. If one thinks in terms of classical observation, somehow the photon must have "known" which detector its entangled sister would go to in the future! It would appear that a future event affected the past detections! Now not only are observations affecting the result, but observations that we don't even know if we're going to make seem to be affecting it! Once again, the QM equations predict the results without any of this future observation nonsense, but they have to do so statistically, by using terms like superposition of states. Trying to explain what any one photon will do is fraught with error! After exploring the exotic results that occur with the series of eraser experiments, hopefully that helps unseat any privileged status that "observation" might have. After that, accepting that philosophy finds it a tricky topic may be more palatable. Then you could explore what individual philosophers thought "observation" or "perception" might be, and the consequences of those beliefs. That's where the real fun begins! 

It also presumes that an explanation one's actions has to be necessary and sufficient, rather than merely a way to convey information. There's also plenty of arguments that you cannot always apply rational thought to the actions of the sane, but that's another beast. EDIT: It is, however, an effective way of distancing ones self from the actions of another. It attempts to make the claim "normal people can't possibly ever think this way," reinforcing any desire the speaker has to convince themselves that they are better than that, and would never do such a thing. 

This would certainly have earthshattering implications for mathematics. One of the deeply rooted concepts within mathematics is the idea of the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3...). If we were to assign numbers to each question, we would see that there's always a next question as long as there's at least a mapping from natural numbers to questions. A trivial mapping would be "What is the most interesting feature of the number X" where X is a natural number. If we ran out of questions, that would suggest that something fell apart in the mathematics of natural numbers, because natural numbers should always be able to yield one more question. That would be quite earthshattering... and most likely spawn its own questions. Now there are other ways we could run out of questions, but they do need to be addressed on a case by case basis. For example, if we run out of questions because we ran out of energy in the universe with which to ask them, that calls for a very different sort of contingency plan. 

Your test can be applied to 1. The result of dividing up 1 into pairs and observing whether there is an unpaired unit or not results in 0 pairs and 1 unpaired unit, making it odd. The only reason why 1 would not be odd by your definition is because you explicitly define it as such, with no rationale given other than the desire to make it not be odd. It took you extra sentences in order to exclude it, which weren't even part that described the test itself. As with the other mathematical question linked, the real answer is one of lingusitics and the nature of mathematicians. Both the sets {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...} and {3, 5, 7, 9, ...} are indeed sets that can be defined. One of them could be given the title "odd numbers." As it turns out, mathematicians prefer the simple definition which does not arbitrarily exclude 1 instead of the definition which does arbitrarily exclude 1. You are welcome to care more about the latter set, but the former set is the one which mathematicians as a whole have given a single-word name to. You also might be interested in the concept of the parity of zero. Parity is the concept behind the definitions of odd and even. The system of parity states that zero is even. Of all the numbers which might get arbitrary exclusions, zero is much more common, and not even zero gets excluded here.
