All this is going to give you the ability to lift your weight up by an overhead grip, by training your upper back, biceps, and latissimus dorsi. Mixing it into your workout plan Essentially, unless you work out every single day, you can do these every time you work out. We normally work by the rule of thumb where we give our muscles 48 hours before working them again. For instance, if you have a split where you work legs, chest, and back separately, you would work pullups as your primary exercise on back day, but on legs and chest day, you throw in pullups at the end. Not only does this ensure that you work your entire body, but it also gives you the benefit of also working pullups when your body is already exhausted. There are a lot of gains to be had when working out until you're tired, and still going at it. 

If you're not locking out, I'm not counting it. They'd get 0 reps counted in a competition, so they're just fooling themselves into thinking they're doing lots of reps. Additionally, getting a full stretch on the muscle (in this case, the latissimus dorsi and bicep in particular) before starting the rep will give you more of a payout if you're doing it for the actual training, and not just to show off. Their delusions will hold them back, gains-wise. If you're having some sort of internal competition, impose a lock-out rule. If you don't, people will just go down as far as it pleases them to get a higher count, and people will stop at different points. A lock-out rule will keep everyone honest. 

A lot of people have this problem, and it's usually caused by short tendons on the back of your ankle. I forget the name... Achilles? Anyway, there are plently of things you can try in order to fix this, and yes, the weight is supposed to drive into the ground through your heels. Method 1 One way, is to elevate your heels, by placing them on top of plates. 

I sincerely doubt that packing peanuts will provide any resistance to your punches. Rice is something you can buy cheaply in huge bulk, and is dense enough to provide the resistance you need. You can also help packing it by using old clothes you don't need. It doesn't have to be all rice. If you use a mixture of small particles (e.g. rice or sand) and bigger ones (e.g. packing peanuts), then you need to consider the Brazil Nut effect, aka "granular convection". When you shake a container with both small and large particles, the larger ones will jump, and smaller ones will fall through cracks. The smaller particles will then collect at the bottom, and create a weird imbalance in the punching bag. Using clothes in the mix will help mitigate this effect, and keep a steadier and more even mix. 

Ah, the powerball. I had forgotten these existed after I broke mine. A powerball is indeed a workout tool, but it has an extremely limited effect. It can help with strengthening grip by engaging forearm muscles, but depending on how you "swing" it, you can get some upper arm and shoulder work into it. Forearms To train forearm and grip, have a constant 90 degree angle in your elbow joint, and simply rotate your wrist to keep it going. Upper arms This time, keep your wrist fixed, and rotate your elbow joint to keep it going. This engages the bicep and tricep, and will take a bit of getting used to. But again, it's very import that you're not rotating your wrist here. It should be completely straight throughout the entire movement, and the only joint that is moving is the elbow. Shoulders This is the tricky one. Extend your arm completely out to the side, and lock out both your elbow and wrist. Now rotate the entire arm to keep the ball in motion. It's kinda like washing your window, but with a completely straight arm. Your hand should be making perfect circular motions. 

Purely nutritional questions tend to get closed, but just to outline the idea; Take 2 caps of amino with breakfast. Take one scoop (~5 grams) of creatine with ~250ml of water 15 minutes before workout. Chug it immediately, and don't let it dissolve. It should look disgusting. Take one protein shake sometime after workout but before bedtime. Just before bedtime has been shown to have somewhat better effect (source), but it might make you sleep uneasy as you're digesting while sleeping. If you're already using Gold's (whey), then I see no reason to use a casein product simultaneously. But since you've already bought it, you could consider having a shake a couple hours before the workout. Casein is a more slow-acting protein, and takes slightly longer to digest as it releases amino acids into the bloodstream at a slower pace. 

The sad truth is, if you can do as many as 25, you're not building strength by doing it any more. You're building endurance. You won't be getting leaner, or build bigger muscles. But if you're doing it anyway, do 25 every two hours instead, because you should be taking mini-pauses in your seated work-day regardless. Hell, once an hour would be even better. But my best tip: To combat any negative effects on your posture due to sitting for too long (and I should know, I'm a software developer by day, avid gym-goer by night), you should do stretches. There are a ton of stretches you can do without even leaving your seat. I'd list some, but if I did, I'd have to describe them with words, and I'd end up listing too many because there are so many good ones, but I found some pictures here: $URL$ I'm particularly fond of the one they call The Freedom Search (and now I regret linking it, because those are some ridiculously horrible names). This stretch is almost like an hourly reset-button for your slouched posture. Hold it for a minute or so, back arched backwards over the back of your chair, head leaned even further back, open your mouth wide, and take good, deep breaths. It's a bit of an energy booster as well. Gives you a good surge of oxygen. In the picture it shows them sitting on the tip of their seat, but I prefer really arching over the back of the chair. If you're lucky, you might get a few pops as well. 

It's hard to achieve in the first place. You need to put a LOT of time and effort, and even money into it, in order to get the "gym body". A lot of people try, and don't succeed, even WITH the time and money spent. It takes years. Yes years! In plural! 

This will depend largely on how you warm up. Starting with your max from the get-go is, as you well know, not a good idea. Warmups are essential to prevent injury. Warming up at 30-60% and then jumping up to 90-100% is going to come as a shock to your nervous system, because if you wrongly estimate how heavy it's going to be, chances are you'll mess up your form by spending way too much energy at the first few centimeters of the lift. My best tip, is that when you do pyramids, go low-to-high-to-low, making sure that before the first low, you are properly warmed up. I know, the idea of "tiring myself out before I hit max" might seem bad, but unless you're doing some serious hypertrophy work, it's not going to take away from your heaviest lift. Even competetive powerlifters go low-to-high with some insanely heavy lifts before their max. Not only for warming up, but also to ease into the weight, so the intensity doesn't come as a surprise. Bottom line: Doing 3-5 rep sets while working your way up, will have very little effect on your performance at the top of the pyramid. 

Ab wheels are a great tool, but unfortunately, that alone won't give you visible abs. The bottom line is that no matter how well-shaped your abs are, they won't be visible unless you burn the fat that covers them. In other words, I do recommend ab wheels. I love them. But the real way to get visible and toned abs, is to get your diet in order. Both these things combined will have the effect you desire. Since this is a very commonly asked question, I'll refer you to some similar questions with decent answers. What can I do to make my abs look their best in a very short timeframe? What are ways to exercise abdominal muscles without harming your back? What exercises should I perform to reduce fat on a specific area of my body? How to lose fat fast and healthily? Optimal exercises for an abdominal workout 

Yes and no. If you're worried about permanent damage, pain is often the indicator that lets you know something is wrong. Therefore you should NOT take medication which inhibits pain. Instead, you could give the 5k a shot, but abort if the pain gets too substantial. But if, as you suspect, it's really just a minor injury, then the pain can of course be overlooked as what it is; a bruise. In this case, you could opt to relieve the pain with aspirin to get through the run, or just man up and run regardless. 

No, you are NOT doing the right amount of volume. You're doing way too much. And too little. Too much curling, too little of anything else. If you want to see progress, you need variation in your exercise. If you just curl all day, your body will simply get good at curling. It doesn't even need to build muscle, it will just create new neural patterns to help you do this particular movement. You need a complete workout program for your entire body. Like @TestWell says, you need to squat and everything. And I know what you're thinking. "Squatting doesn't do anything for my arms." Well, you'd be wrong. When you're doing a full-body program, there are synergies between all muscle groups and exercises. Your CNS (Central Nervous System) as well as your bones will be developed, and this is something that will yield results all over. And squatting (as well as all the other exercises) is an integral part of this. There are plenty of good beginner programs out there. I believe SL5x5 is among the most popular. You'd do well to start there. And I promise and guarantee, you'll see more results in 4 months of that, than you would in 1 year of what you're doing right now. 

Normal? Yes and no. It's about people and their preferences, not procedure. Etiquette? No rules against it. Don't like it? Get over it. "letting the penis and balls go where ever they want" is just you exaggerating. So long as they're not touching you, they're not doing anything wrong. It's a locker room! They're allowed to be as naked as they please. If they're getting uncomfortably close to you, let them know. Other than that, deal with it. 

I have revised this answer to fit the edited question. First off, just to get it out there; there's no reason not to do both. They both have advantages and disadvantes, the largest of both being the fixed and unfixed grip width, and double axis movement. Cable rows allow you to switch grip types, which is a huge advantage when you want to perform the movement with some progressive overloading in terms of which muscles get more focus. It also allows you, to some extent, to choose to pull it higher towards your chest, or lower towards your stomach for increased variety. Leverage seated row (as I believe it's called) is a machine where the trajectory of the pull is at all times fixed. This means that the distribution of the work load also is fixed every time. This is both a disadvantage (see previous paragraph on cable rows), and an advantage, because there are fewer factors to keep in mind in terms of form. I would put this as an "auxiliary exercise" at the end of the workout, just to get that last minute squeeze and really wear down the muscles in your biceps and upper back. The benefit here is that when you're already weary, form tends to break. This is less of a factor with fixed-trajectory machines. Conclusion So the bottom line, much like the top line, is that both are good. On any day where you train upper back, I would sincerely suggest doing some rows early (like barbell rows and/or cable rows), and then finishing with leverage seated rows at the end. 

This will get real heavy, real fast, but it's the variety that gives our muscles and nervous system the huge kick in the balls it needs. 

Any lie-down exercise should be done on a mat. If your group training session involves lying on your back on the ground without any mats, you should immediately STOP doing that, and seriously question the competence of whoever is arranging these sessions. 

Sports tape to the rescue! My gym used to have the same problem, to the point where some people actually started bleeding. Calluses don't really go away if you work out a lot, and so the injuries inside the hand compounded between exercises like deadlifts, pullups and EZ-curls. The staff at the gym eventually started taping the bars every day because of this. "Every day" because sweat and dust is pretty much absorbed by this type of tape (which, believe it or not, is a good thing, because people also use it to prevent blisters on their feet during long runs/walks). The tape will therefore become dark and dirty after a short while of consistent use. Availability If you're having this issue at your gym, chances are they have drawers full of this stuff, because it's very easy and cheap to get a hold of. And they should be used to people using it on certain pieces of equipment. Especially pullup bars, where people have vastly differing preferences in term of grip. If you're having this problem at home, then go to your local sports shop. If they don't have it, they have no business calling themselves a sports shop! 

Some do, some don't, some will. A lot of people exhibit good posture because they've had the adequate amount of physical exercise while growing up. For instance, young farmers will almost as a rule become very strong and lean because of the amount of physical labor that goes into their role as farm hand. Other people have had to work on their posture, until it became second nature. I.e. they did it consciously for so long, it's now something they don't have to think about. (Personally, I fall into this category.) Meanwhile, some people simply have to make a conscious effort to keep their shoulders squared, chest and chin up etc. 

Again, this is a rule of thumb, but it's a place to start. For the rep ranges in between, you can probably guess what's going on there. It's not like you're getting "the best of both worlds" by going with 6-rep sets, but it's not like we discourage their use. For posture, I'd suggest 8-12 reps per set, for 3 sets. This study suggests that if one is aiming for hypertrophy (size gains), doing more than 2-3 sets provides very little benefit. Most of it is achieved through the first 3 sets. I've adopted this tip into my own training with good results as well, just to throw some anecdotal evidence into the mix. The best tip for good posture I would be a bad advice-giver if I didn't say this. If you want good posture, do the big compound movements. A compound movement is an exercise which engages a large set of muscles. Deadlift is widely regarded as the #1 exercise, and belongs in any exercise regimen. It works lower back, legs, upper back, shoulders, neck, forearms... The list goes on. While I like to draw the deadlift out as the biggest posture exercise, the other compound movements you absolutely should be doing are;
