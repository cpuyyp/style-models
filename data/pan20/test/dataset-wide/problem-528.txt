The best method for handling exterior frame rust depends on how much time you'd like to invest. The difference comes down to what you use to complete the two basic steps: 

Rubber rim strip is pretty stretchy stuff--and you want it to fit snugly! Therefore, if buying rubber the diameter of your rim strip is not nearly as important as the width. It should cover all the spoke nipples and/or the large holes drilled for the spokes, and fit well along the rim. That said, your local shop should have some in a size that fits 26" rims best. Alternatively, there are brands of rim strip which are not one continuous piece and are not rubber, but instead are similar to thick tape. It's important to note the thickness--electrical tape may work in a pinch (and after a couple layers) but it's not nearly as resilient. This type of rim strip is basically one-size-fits all and is generally considered higher quality that the rubber type. 

You're absolutely right--children's bicycles with training wheels are good for exercise and entertainment, but they do little to nothing for balance. In my experience, the best way to teach anyone--children included--to ride a bicycle is to take the pedals off, lower the seat, and let them scoot & coast around until they develop the proper balance. Then, add the pedals, and let them coast, pedal, etc. For children, there are several popular brand that makes 'run bikes', which are usually made out of wood, and have neither training wheels nor pedals. They are low enough that the child can sit in the saddle and place both feet on the ground, but high enough that they can still propel themselves & lift their feet to coast. These bikes allow the child to quickly and safely develop good bicycle balance. (See $URL$ $URL$ and $URL$ 

I've seen both P-clamps (a.k.a. brace clamps) and the similar, ratcheting versions used. This is actually the preferred method for some front racks on bicycles without rack braze-ons on the fork. As long as they're the right diameter, and there's a little rubber (even an old tube) between the fork and the clamp, it should work fine. 

This means that the former is 8mm shorter in diameter than the latter, and when you mount a 700c wheel to a bicycle with brakes set for a 27" wheel, they will be mis-aligned by 4mm (a significant amount). Depending on what type and variety brakes you have, you may or may not be able to reposition the brake pads correctly. In the case that you can't, you will be able to replace them with brakes designed to have a longer 'reach'. 

I haven't used a handlebar bag myself, but the same logic applies. Weight in such a bag will have a very high center of gravity, as well as the ability to turn with you. Therefore, it might be a good place for maps, snacks, phone/keys/wallet, patch kit, etc. 

This is pretty unconventional and not necessarily available to you, but here's some food for thought. Friends of mine had had a custom 'rack' built for their Kona Ute by a local rack & frame-builder to transport their two daughters (although they are much older). It came out exceptionally well (plus the girls love it): 

Not sure about filling in hairlines, but I have used Pledge and have been very happy with the results! 

Based on this picture, it looks like it was most likely purchased at a department store. I am not sure how knowing the brand will help you decide whether or not you will get a new bike. IMO the main criteria for determining this would be function and comfort. 

Both Neil & Ttarchala are spot on. The one additional comment or perspective that should be considered is with a smaller cockpit your body may not be stretched out enough and for me the impact of mountain biking on a bike with too tight a cockpit wreaks havoc on my BACK! Think of your spine as a coil...is there more flex when it pushed together or stretched out...that flex softens the ride and allows for more movement which ultimately improves your riding, is less taxing on the body therefore less fatiguing. Also, too long a stem tends to put too much weight forward which increases the likelihood of issues with your upper body and increasing propensity to endo :( Be careful..probably not a viable option! 

YES! I have had frame damage occur, but it was not from chain slap alone! As Daniel mentioned, it was on a steel steed, that led to corrosion. In fact it was on the very first bike in which I was totally smitten, a Ritchey P-23 :( Sadly, the chainstay did crack. Ritchey did repair, so all was not lost. The term ridden hard and put away wet...yep on steel frames with chain slap or any paint chips for that matter is not a good idea! Most of us keep our bikes in a garage or in basement rampant with moisture. The MIT (most important thing) is to dry your steel steed! Over the years I have seen this numerous times and just saw an old Serrota at the LBS with major rust to point where the shop was not going to do any repairs because failure was imminent. Most of my riding is in RI, along the ocean, so that may accelerate the corrosion. 

Slide back on saddle and drive heels through the bottom of the pedal stroke If you need to stand, do so while minimizing body sway and unnecessary counterproductive upper body motion Get into a rhythm - climb at your own pace Stay upright to keep lungs operating at full capacity Pull handlebars into your thighs as you drive pedals forward 

This question is akin to, "I have a Chevy and a buddy of mine went into a BMW dealership..." If you are happy in the Chevy, do not test drive the BMW! Once you do, you will likely notice all sorts of inefficiencies that you did not previously :-( As Jahaziel and Gary.Ray point out aerodynamics, bike handling and overall comfort are all factors and ultimately personal choice. Mix into the equation average miles per ride, type of terrain, road surface, rider weight, typical wind and climate conditions and the variables are unfortunately endless...this is both the beauty and the curse of finding the perfect set up! Based on the fact that you mentioned racing, I encourage you to hit the BMW dealership or in this case the LBS! Most shops have test wheels...so give a few a whirl and make your own experienced/educated decision. A good set of wheels is the single most significant upgrade to any steed! I have ridden all types and many brands...so do not hesitate to ask more specific questions about manufacturers or models! 

I generally pull on my brakes equally while on the road and bias toward the back if I am stopping hard while offroad. I'd rather lock up the back wheel around a turn than the front wheel. The front wheel only had so much friction to spend. I rarely need to panic stop when it really makes any difference. Under most conditions the front and rear brakes are capable of generating the same braking force. Edit: after many more years of riding I don't stand by this opinion anymore. using both brakes is a good move in the snow or wet and you gain an intuition of when you are using too much of either but maximal braking force can be achieved with the front brake alone in dry conditions. 

Such a thing does exist and it's the best! I own an Arkel Sherpack and Randonneur rack. The rack is great because I don't have any mounting points on my frame for traditional panniers. The rack hold very tight. I have commuted with two hefty laptops, lunch, and a change of clothes on it. I've been doing that kind of thing for well over a year. Everything has held up. The pack has a sleeve on the back into which the rack slides. You can secure, with a buckle that comes on the pack, the pack to your seat post. If the bag is full it doesn't move. If the bag is kind of empty and things can slide around I notice when I get off that things can be drooped to one side but I never notice while riding. The pack's sleeve on the back unzips and can be tucked away in a velcro compartment on the bottom (inside of which you can also keep a rain fly). It turns into a hiking day pack with hip and chest strap in like 10 seconds. I have hiked with a 3 litre bladder in the interior pouch too. The pack is by no means 70 L ( I think it is 22) but it is still a great compromise. Light commuter, easy access, fully functioning regular backpack. I've really enjoyed mine. 

Then at least your hands are free and it's always pointed in the right direction. It'd probably get torn away in super high wind (hopefully not with your head). I couldn't find a picture but you could even try it with one of those deep, shoulder width, clear umbrellas too. Then your shoulders would be covered too. Either way your feet/hands/arms/legs are all still going to get wet and unless you have fenders your butt and back are going to get wet too. 

I've had this happen before too. "Skipping" while putting lots of torque down, although it wasn't skipping left/right it was skipping up/down on the sprocket. It turned out that replacing the chain without replacing the gears was a waste. Because the chain had been so old and thus deformed/stretched this caused the all the teeth on the sprockets to be deformed as well. Normally when a chain gets old you replace it before it's deformation influences the rest of the drivetrain but it will if you let it go. By replacing the chain and not the gears your new chain was aged almost instantly to the state of the old chain by the already deformed gears. the gears are much stronger than the chain and try to force the chain to conform to their shape. Before their deformations are in sync you will feel skipping. The answer for me was to either 

Here's the skinny from my perspective. Two factors: weight & aerodynamics Carbon wheels are super lightweight which requires less power to spin. Taller(Deep Profile) rims are more aerodynamic, so once moving they reduce wind resistance. Obviously, the taller the rim, the more material, therefore they are also heavier. Many folks talk about spin up, which means how quickly one is able to get the bike up to speed, when discussing Taller/Deep Profile wheels. The ideal wheel is a balance between these two factors, but then again, it really boils down to your goal? Are you racing? If so, what is type of racing? Are you able to afford/maintain multiple sets of wheels? This is a great question because it deals with the one area that many inexperienced riders underestimate. Wheels IMO, after the frameset, is the most important component of speed, weight and ride quality! Please keep in mind this is only scratching the surface, but nonetheless I hope it helps! 

My recommendation is to use a rag and de-greaser like Simple Green. Apply the solution to your rag, wet pads let the liquid do its thing and wipe clean/dry. If that does not work, repeat. If after doing that twice you are not getting the appropriate braking power, I would gently sand the face of the brake pad with a fine grit sandpaper. 

Studded tires are a must on ice. They are expensive, but well worth it! A couple of points to consider that have not been mentioned: Footwear: Winter specific riding shoes or boots. For mountain biking and cross, I ride with Lake boots. On the road, I use an older pair of road shoes that have been stretched to accommodate thick wool socks and neoprene shoe covers. Head-wear: I typically ride with a helmet cover all winter. I also bring along a couple different varieties of skull caps on ride ranging in thickness, ear/face coverage etc... yes to balaclavas!!! Depth of snow: whether you are running studs or not, my experience is that if the snow is deeper than 4-5 inches, it is not ride-able. In this case, it is best to wait until either the cross country skiers, hikers or plows(in the case of roads) have cleared or packed down the snow. Body Temperature: Many cyclists new to riding in colder weather tend to over dress. The trick that works for me is twofold, first absolutely dress in layers and second I want to be cold, not freezing, but cold as I go outside and get my bike ready or at the very start of the ride. If I am warm at that point, I will be sweat soaked in the matter of minutes and wetness is something you want avoid! Fender: Clearly, if the snow is dry, it is not necessary, but my experience is it is better to have one as a precaution than go without! Heat Packs: At extreme temperatures, I have successfully used heat packs in the tips of my shoes and palms of my gloves. I am not a huge fan of use in the palms, I very rarely and if i do it is usually just a temporary fix. Use of Car Heater: If I am driving to the ride, I preheat my shoes and as much clothing as possible using my car heater on the way to the ride. If you get yourself set up with studs, I would highly recommend finding a frozen lake or pond to ride on! The experience is phenomenal! If you can time the lake ride with 1-2 inches of fresh snow it will be that much better! I ride road, mountain and cross year round outside. Hope this helps!
