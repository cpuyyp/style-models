It is widely recognised that GDP as conventionally measured does not reflect an economyâ€™s impact on the environment and its consumption of natural resources. There have been various attempts to develop broader measures of economic performance via adjustments to conventional GDP (some of which also address non-environmental limitations of conventional GDP), for example: 

Since the exchange ratio of A to B is 10 to 1 in the first transfer and 5 to 1 in the second, it is clear that B is more valuable, although as @denesp says the exact value ratio is undefined. It's a very odd question because it focuses only on transfers between the coins and says nothing about the rates at which the coins might exchange for real goods, in other words, the prices of goods in terms of the coins. 

Recall, that the directional derivative of a function is defined as the the rate at which the function $f(x,y,z)$ at a given point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ changes in direction of the vector $v$, where $||v||$ is the norm of $v$1. What comes to mind Applications of the directional derivative can be used in determining the rate of switching inputs in production functions, which can be very helpful in determining/forecasting switching costs for a given bundle of inputs. Though it does not tell you where the optimum points are it does tell you the rate of change (i.e. the switching costs) of moving to a different bundle. Hope this is helpful 1 $URL$ 

It is possible for a country to have economic growth without population growth. Three sources of economic growth are: 

Certain types of agricultural subsidies are permitted under the WTO's Green Box. These include direct income support for farmers, and environmental and regional development programmes. However the rules state that, to qualify, such subsidies must be no more than minimally trade-distorting. Whether such subsidies (in the US and other countries) actually meet that requirement is a matter of controversy, as discussed in this ICTSD Information Note which also shows (in Figure 1) the very high Green Box proportion of US subsidies. 

London is surrounded by a "green belt", a large area which government policy has protected from housing development. The current high cost of housing in London has led some to advocate a selective relaxation of the policy so that housing supply can be increased (there have been reports by London First, the Adam Smith Institute, and Shelter, although their economic analysis is in some respects not very deep). Question Can anyone give a reference to an academic paper or official report which provides, for a site anywhere in the world, a full cost-benefit analysis of the conversion of undeveloped land for housing development? Within "undeveloped land" I include agricultural land, woodland, grassland or parkland, whether accessible to the public or not. By "full" I mean a cost-benefit analysis which includes at least a serious attempt using environmental valuation techniques to quantify the value of the range of ecosystem services that undeveloped land may provide and may be lost on development, eg drainage, water purification, support for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and opportunity for recreation. 

My question : The way the case seems to be presented is that the architect is forced to choose 40 percent in light of the alternative where there is no profits to be gained. What about the architect's opportunity cost? Isn't there what to be gained from the architect when refusing this split of profits in a 40-60 split as far as opportunity cost in concerned? 

Conventionally both demand and supply for goods and services are both more elastic in the long run than in the short run. My Question 

The reason why Cobb Douglas production functions are so popular stem from the fact that the following assumptions are satisfied while remaining statistically rigorous1: Recall the Cobb- Douglas production function form: $$F(K,AL)=K^{\alpha}(AL)^{1-\alpha}$$ where $0<\alpha <1$ (i.e. the share of output that goes to capital) $1)$ Positive marginal products: $${\partial{F(K,AL)}\over{\partial K}}>0 \space , \space\space{\partial{F(K,AL)}\over{\partial (AL)}}>0$$ $2)$ Diminishing Marginal Products (as you already mentioned) $${\partial^2{F(K,AL)}\over{\partial K^2}}<0 \space , \space\space{\partial^2{F(K,AL)}\over{\partial (AL)^2}}<0$$ $3)$ Constant Returns to Scale (this is how most production processes work) $$F(\lambda K, \lambda AL)= \lambda F(K, AL)$$ for any $\lambda \ge 0$ (E.g. "Double input $\Rightarrow$ Double output") Hope this helps!! 

The change in total consumer surplus is the difference between a) the initial total consumer surplus and b) the final total consumer surplus. The sequence of the price changes has no bearing on either (a) or (b). (a) is E + F and (b) is (A + D + E + G) + (B + C + F + H). Hence the change in total consumer surplus is an increase equal to (b) minus (a) or A + D + G + B + C + H. 

While many points can be made about the pros and cons of inflation, the following is one of the most fundamental. Suppose A borrows \$100 from B and inflation is 5% per year. To keep things simple, assume the terms of the loan require repayment after one year. When the repayment falls due, A pays B \$100, but because of the inflation it is only worth (at the original price level) $100/1.05 \approx \$95.2$. So A's debt has been somewhat eased by the inflation (and if the term of the loan were much longer the easing could be much greater). But what about B? In real terms B has lost the same amount that A has gained. Other things being equal, therefore, inflation benefits borrowers and costs lenders. And in total, amounts lent must equal amounts borrowed. It may be that the the borrowers (government, struggling households) are more visible than the lenders (better-off households, foreigners). Nevertheless, the effects on lenders, and on incentives for future lenders, cannot be ignored. Where inflation is expected, lenders will as suggested in Henry's comment demand a higher interest rate to offset their expected loss on the principal repayment. 

David Romer in his textbook Advanced Macroeconomics (Third Edition) writes regarding the speed of convergence of the Diamond model the following: (Pg. 83) 

Recall the steady state level of unemployment is: $$u^*={q\over{q+f}}$$ where: $q=$ job separation rate $\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space f=$ job finding rate Thus, to try to lower the natural rate of unemployment would man to try to reduce the job separation rate $q$ and increase the job finding rate $f$. Examples of methods for increasing the job finding rate are: Government employment agencies: disseminate info about job openings to better match workers and jobs. Public Job training programs: help workers displaced from declining industries get skills needed for jobs in growing industries. An example which can be used to reduce job separation rate is: Labor unions: Unions exercise monopoly power to secure higher wages, better working conditions etc. for their members.This in turn can help reduce the job separation rate by providing conditions which would be more suitable for for members employed to want to still hold onto their present jobs. Hope this is helpful!! 

Short answer: whether a firm's maximum 'profit' at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost is positive or negative depends on whether average revenue exceeds average cost at that point. To give a simple numerical example, suppose for a firm in a perfectly competitive market: $$MR = AR = 1$$ $$TC = 2 + 0.4Q + 0.1Q^2$$ where $MR$ is marginal revenue, $AR$ is average revenue, $TC$ is total cost and $Q$ is quantity produced and sold (for a defined period). Then marginal cost $MC$ is: $$MC = 0.4 + 0.2Q$$ and $MC = MR$ when: $$0.4+0.2Q=1$$ implying $Q = 3$. At that point, however, average cost $AC$ is: $$AC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{2 + 0.4(3)+ 0.1(3^2)}{3} = \frac{4.1}{3} \approx 1.37 > 1 = AR$$ So the firm would make a loss of $4.1 - 3 = 1.1$ by producing at $Q=3$. In this case 'profit' at the point identified by equating $MC$ and $MR$ is only a local maximum within the range $Q > 0$. Note for example that the loss at $Q=2$ is $3.2-2=1.2$ and that at $Q=4$ is $5.2-4=1.2$. The global maximum 'profit' within the range $Q\geq0$ is zero at $Q=0$, so (considering the period in isolation), the firm would do better not to produce at all. 

Morton Davis in his book Game Theory: A non-Technical introduction brings the following example of a non-zero sum game (pg.73) : 

Based on this definition is appears that even under full employment workers do not find work instantly under the Shapiro Stiglitz model. What exactly am I missing? 

The Consumer price index of a country is defined as: $$CPI_{t}^{t_0}={{P_{1t} Q_{1t_0}+P_{2t}Q_{2t_0}+P_{3t}Q_{3t_0}}\over{P_{1t_0}}Q_{1t_0}+P_{2t_0}Q_{2t_0}+P_{3t_0}Q_{3t_0}} \times 100$$ where $P$ is price, $Q$ is quantity, $t$ is reference to current year and $t_0$ is reference to the base year. So using this formula we get: $${{10\times8 +4 \times 15+18 \times 6}\over{9 \times 8+3 \times 15 +12 \times 6}} \times 100 \approx 131.2 $$ Now finding the inflation rate we can see (CPI of the base year is always going to be $100$) $${{131.2-100}\over{100}} \times 100 \% \approx 31\%$$ Hope this is helpful! 

You are right: both the price-elasticity of demand and the price-elasticity of supply affect the respective proportions for producers and consumers of the burden of a per unit tax imposed on sales by producers. The proportions depend on the relative slopes, which reflect price-elasticities, of the demand and supply curves. Considering the elastic supply case in your diagram, the slope of the demand curve between points AE is much steeper than that of the supply curve between CE. Hence E is much closer, in the vertical (price) dimension, to C than to A. Thus the post-tax price to consumers (p2 corresponding to A) is much further from the pre-tax price (p1 corresponding to E) than is the post-tax price to producers (p3 corresponding to C),and so most of the burden falls on consumers. For the inelastic supply case the position is reversed. A detailed explanation may be found in this NTRC paper (see section III). 

Under the Shapiro-Stiglitz model the No-Shirking Condition is: $$w=\bar{e}+\left( \rho +\frac{\bar{L}}{\bar{L}-NL}b \right)\frac{\bar{e}}{q}$$ Where: $\bar{e}=$ exerted effort by employees $\rho=$ discount rate $\bar{L}=$ total number of workers $N\bar{L}=$ number of employed workers $b=$ job separation rate $q=$ shirking detection rate (From Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics 3rd edition, pg. 453) 

To see if the preferences between $u$ and $u'$ are the same, simply look at the $MRS$ of both of them to see if they are equivalent. i.e. $$MRS_{u}=\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}=\frac{\left(0.5x^{-0.5}y^{0.5}\right)}{\left(0.5x^{0.5}y^{-0.5}\right)}=\frac{y}{x}$$ $$MRS_{u'}=\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{y}}=\frac{y}{x}$$ $$\Rightarrow MRS_u=MRS_{u'}$$ $\therefore$ $u$ and $u'$ have the same preferences. Hope this is helpful 

This being said there is one thing that comes to mind when wanting to model house pricing based on this reality: Game Theory. My Question: Is there any (famous or otherwise) papers which discuss the nature of Game Theory in the housing market? (Papers with computer simulations of the housing market are additionally helpful!) 

Hint. Is it always the case that MPC + MPS = 1? Or does this hold only in a certain type of model with assumptions that simplify from reality? 

It has been argued that the concept of present value was implicit in Liber Abaci (1202) by Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci). This paper by Goetzmann makes this claim in its abstract and introduction, and presents (pp 26-7) an example from Liber Abaci of what appears to be present value analysis. 

One possible circumstance relates to firms undertaking long term contracts (eg for building or engineering work). Where a contract is uncompleted at the end of a period, the firm may (depending on its accounting policies) include in its turnover an amount reflecting its assessment of the work in progress. Sometimes unforeseen difficulties in completing a contract will subsequently come to light, and it may become necessary to include an offsetting reduction within turnover for the next period. If the contract is a large proportion of the firm's activity, then this could result in overall turnover for that period being negative.
