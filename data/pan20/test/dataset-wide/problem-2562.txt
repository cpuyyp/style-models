I know that space is often said to be unconditioned, and it seems right to say that it is empty of svabhava. 

However, much Mahayana Buddhism uses the term in a different way, to mean what the scholar Westerhoff calls "essence svabhava". I believe I have it on very good (academic) authority that's what Zhiyi means when he talks about emptiness of svabhava. I can't really guess if that's from genuine, not merely contingent / historical, evolution of the term, as it features in Buddhist "philosophy". But if I may I'll add my own opinion: Zhiyi and his tientai school in general are talking about the exact same concept but refined it. Wetsterhoff claims 

I believe that the Buddha does say, in some suttas, "I have", so this makes sense to assert, whether or not it's true! If your question is best answered via saying what that "I" means, when Buddhas say it, I personally feel it refers to Buddha nature, and not the bodhisattva that has fulfilled its vows and been used up. Thanks! 

what exactly is a "substantial cause"? Once you have that you can work out whether every moment of consciousness is preceded by another moment of consciousness as a substantial cause. What's important is that you do so without begging the question. I don't think Descartes thought that reality is indivisible. Descartes is engaged in a specific metaphysical project to describe the nature of "reality itself", and in doing so he says that mind and body are "really distinct". If in reality itself mind can exist without body, and vice versa, then it is wrong to say that reality is indivisible, whether or not reality is divided. 

Moreover, could be mean anything unconditioned, permanent, or in some way separate from the rest of 'us'? The tags are clues, but I'm not being facetious. 

Read the literature, talk with Buddhists, try to work out for yourself what is reasonable to believe. Give up your insight practice. Find a tradition which doesn't ask you to hold a view you don't have. 

Hope that my question is pertinent here :) ? Can anyone here help me think about the difference between the two :) ? 

Following on from a few question I've asked about nihilism, I wondered - quite casually if not in an idle way - whether seeking to enlighten other sentient beings (into Buddhahood) is ever redemptive of either stimulus or response (I just mean self and other)? Because in zen you can't seek to be a buddha, and in pure land you seek deliverance from another buddha, and theravada teaches the path of the arhant. 

So they're different names for suchness, the essence of mind, dependent on if we mean that the excellent qualities are latent or manifest. 

In Buddhism what is the word for this "introspectively accessible" aspect of "what it is like"? Is the term just "phenomena" or is there some other more subtle translation, like "awareness"? 

I was struck, when reading on the history of Buddhism in China, by the stories of brave monks escaping certain death, often many times in one life. I was curious is this was something Indian Buddhists also wrote about, or if it was something peculiar to China. Do these stories also appear in earlier reports, in the Buddha's life, etc.? 

My question Assuming it true that there can be causation without causes, then is there any way to argue that the sentences of science, with their unique particulars eliminated, are not conceptually constructed? Perhaps because only those particulars are as such, and so empty; and our ideas about the rest of the world can be grounded in them, without that structure being thereby empty. 

Seems to me that memory is notoriously fallible, whatever we think about the nature of the self. I have a copy, but rather than reread it, I thought to ask, whether Dogen's wholehearted way, or right effort in general, from moment to moment, involves relying only on those memories of immediate relevance? 

I suppose some of my family are Christian, and though I wasn't really raised that way, I'm wondering, if Buddhism is syncretic, as with the Tao in China, how it has or will combine with the Abrahamaic religions. Has there been any serious scholarship charting this, or even, though the idea seems off, predicting it? 

I have often been told that nirvana is not a state or entity, because there are no real states or entities in Mahayana Buddhism. If so, is that nirvanisation (a word I've seen for the process of coming to enlightenment) a state for those that undergo it? 

I believe that all Buddhist "sects" would say that there is a path to nirvana. In deed this is the "fourth noble truth", though different "sects" interpret it differently, or at least claim that other "sects" have a different understanding of it. For your purposes, maybe that's what the long history of doctrinal debate is actually about. I believe that all Buddhists claim that meditation is a prerequisite to nirvana, though that seems to take different forms, with different "sects" vying over e.g. the terms "sudden" and "gradual", and with different instructions and communities. I've put 'sect' in quotes because I'm going to side with what I understand from soto zen, which I think stresses that we "don’t practice zazen in order to get enlightened, we practice being enlightened as we practice zazen". So the fukanzazengi by Dogen says: 

I'm thinking that the presence itself, in sense objects, of ignorance, the first link, is never erased; that with final nirvana something has being, the absence of the 12 links. Can the absence of causation itself be present like sense objects are, in absolutely any Buddhist philosophy? Or is that silly, like saying that the there exists the non existence of a crow's teeth? 

ARe there any schools which say that Shakyamuni the historical Buddha, alone, will ever be a Buddha? I understand that some might identify him fully with the dharmakaya, but isn't it completely canonical that there is a Buddha vehicle for others, at some point in time? 

I am still baffled by your confusion of pleasure with sexy pleasure! Not all forms are sex, and if they were, then one would be in a pickle! Sometimes even good things can be pleasurable, such as cooking a good meal for someone else. 

Suppose Dave is a Buddha. Does he want to be a Buddha? Will he get what he wants - forever ? Does it matter ? 

Emphasis mine. I find the idea of citta without any sense consciousness at all completely baffling! I think that unless your canon explicitly says, probably best to make up your own mind. 

Does a realization or just thorough understanding of impermanence, as it appears in Buddhism, benefit a non-believer in the rest of Buddhism, at all, especially not karma? I'm not asking if they can reach samadhi or be on the path, but if the effect of karma is really quite small and more a matter of character than empirical events, what good does an understanding of impermanence grant, in that sort of world? 

What did Santideva, the authour of the Bodhicaryāvatāra, say about the realisabaility of Buddhahood? What assurances did he make? 

I understand that according to some "schools" at least historical ones that the historical Buddha didn't teach the Mayanaha. Is that true? 

Does 'right speech' prohibit expressions which "hate" anything at all? So, not an individual, or even really a point of view, but to ex-press the sensation of intense (if not actually visceral) dislike? 

Hey I just wondered: I met a high intensity theravadin meditator (who teaches it) and he defined the self enlightened as being meditators that no one had to teach. It came naturally, so to speak. Is it possible to be practicing this untaught meditation but not be self enlightened? 

Well, I'm just going to give my two cents, based on not being raised a Buddhist or in a Buddhist etc. nation. You can read about the effects of cultural appropriation, and decide if you want to call yourself a Buddhist, practice as one, etc.. I had never encountered this in scholarship, but it does exist peculiar to Buddhism. There'll be blogs discussing it, but who do you believe? I think the question of religion, like philosophy and ethics, is not just cultural. So (and I wouldn't want to affect concern) if you feel Buddhism could be sound on these accounts, and / or you need it (to be?), then I would suggest retaining your interest, and concern. I embraced reading about it because it felt right to. Terms like "Buddhist" don't seem as important, which may be offensive but also seems right. IME asking people "is this offensive" is offensive, and you have to ultimately have to make that judgement yourself, short of being ordained or something. I hope that you get the answer you're looking for! 

Are these three ways exhaustive? I do not know if a paccekabuddha / Pratyekabuddha claims that the Buddha has realised the truth before they themselves have realised it. Or what Mahayana schools say about belief without faith or realisation. It seems, though, that it depends on what you mean by "realised the truth". Clearly, if this only is no "psychological effect", then anyone who hasn't "realised the truth" is only making that claim based on a "psychological effect". 

It depends on what you mean "true" Buddhist. If you mean sincere, devoted, mindful and so on then of course. Can you be enlightened? Yeah I think people say that, but only super super SUPER rarely! 

Has any Buddhist meditator claimed that the mano-vijnana has a base (I don't mean that in any technical sense) to differentiate it from the other consciousnesses? If so, what is it called, and when is its action suspended? 

I just wondered, is it bad karma at all to disagree with an arhat? I'm not saying I would, I just wondered, because killing one is phenomenally bad! What about disagreeing with a Buddha? 

Does everyone need to sit, even zen masters, especially according to Soto zen? Or are certain highly accomplished meditators incapable of experiencing scattered thoughts? 

Is it equating the real truth of the separate teaching with the complete teaching's mundane truth? The so called "separate teaching" is what Yogacara and Hua-yen Buddhists claim, and Zhiyi says (translated by Swanson) says that therein: 

Nietzsche said... Whether we see death as a rebirth or not, that does IMHO mean that release from suffering (even if we say that all life is suffering) is not opposed to life and not opposed to living. 

Does any Buddhist school claim that what arises when it is divided or destroyed, whether or not that exists etc., is the self? 

Might it be true that emptiness can be conceived of as the one taste of mind: that the world of mind has only one reality which is everywhere and always the same, unchanging. Who (which groups or individuals) say so? And: what reasons are there to believe it is a correct charaterisation of mind? 

The quote seems to say that the Tathagata is not without form feeling etc.. If nirvana were something in addition to the aggregates, then I'm thinking the Tathagata would be without the aggregates. On the grounds that nirvana is all that the Tathagata is.
