The question is not whether you can, it's whether you should. It's unlikely that there will be anything that is truly impossible to make using something that can be defined as 3D printing - but there will be many things that will never be economically viable to make in that way. Generally, the simpler and stronger an item needs to be, the less point there is in printing it. So maybe you could 3D print a hammer, but it'd make much more sense to make it in the usual way. 

There are two options here that I can see: 1) Continental drift on this world is very, very fast. On Earth, you're looking in the order of centimetres per year, or metres per lifetime. For your story, you want somewhere around 100,000 - 1,000,000 times faster than that - 100K times faster would mean that the continents would be hundreds of km apart in the time it takes for a baby to die of old age (assuming a long life-span; halve it if everyone tends to die by 40) and 1M would give you thousands of km in that time (so trans-oceanic distances). If it's just continental drift carrying them apart, then no need for a catastrophic event - however, if the plates are moving in the order of 100m-1km per month, then it's hardly going to be unexpected either. 2) Your bit of land isn't much like any rock on Earth. The simplest option here is that through some strange set of geological circumstances, a bit of land is composed of rock that is less dense than water. If the two aren't very well attached (note that they're not continental plates here) then perhaps the light part could literally float away. Perhaps sea level rise causes the whole slab of rock to float up, whereupon currents gradually carry it away (maybe it moves slowly because most of the time it sits on the sea bed, and only moves at very high tides). Moving and stopping along the sea-bed would probably cause some earthquake-like issues, but nothing that couldn't be built around. 

Can't the aliens use B12, the humans use B10 and computers change their display depending on who is using them? 

The only way I can think around those conflicting requirements is to have a guided projectile - essentially a miniature cruise missile. That way, it can fire at a low velocity (and maintain a steady velocity) out to a long range. A small rocket motor, wings and a miniature guidance system would be needed - laser SACLOS or possibly beam-riding would be my suggested guidance system. 

Depending on the age: 1) Fuse. Lay out a long line of fuse, and set it on fire. The only issue with this is if it doesn't go off as expected, then you don't really know why (it could just be slow-burning), and long bits of fuse aren't necessarily that reliable 2) Mechanical. Depending on when your timeline is, technology like the wheellock could be available (it basically came into being at around the end of the Middle Ages. If you have this technology then you can essentially hook up a musket (or mechanism of) to the end of a long piece of string, and set off the explosives remotely. 

Any spacecraft that is designed for both atmospheric and exo-atmospheric use must essentially be built along aviation lines - where mass-limitation is the key. Under any real-world physics, getting mass up to escape velocity is very energy intensive, which means that any grams saved are worth saving. Spacecraft must withstand many things; but certainly when it comes to transiting Earth-like planets (and the space between them) high pressure isn't one; just enough to hold around 1 BAR. Submarines on the other hand are incredibly heavy as they have to withstand far more pressure. For example, the Kilo-class submarine and the International Space Station are both around the same size (~70m) but the Kilo-class weighs around five times as much (2000-2400 tonnes compared to 400 tonnes). TL;DR - unless you have an exceptionally compelling reason why the spacecraft would need to go underwater and to space (rather than having two separate vehicles) then it wouldn't be worth the huge compromises. 

Fit your space ship with a thousand trillion-tonne keel. Actually, I've thought of something else. The only current way of creating a gravity-like force that we know of is acceleration (such as the rotating ship). Assuming that you want to go somewhere, and have a fuel upply that can last a long time, and are either subject to the laws of physics then as long as you keep accelerating towards your destination at 10ms-2 then you will have artificial gravity (of course, it will be in a different direction than one would expect. When you get half-way there, spin the ship around and use them as retro-rockets to slow down at the same rate. 

A few calculations: Assuming that you're going to travel at, say, 0.1C it will take you around 40 years to reach Alpha Centauri, and only around a month to accelerate to that speed at 1G. If you can hit 0.5C then it becomes a bit more relevant; ~8 years to travel the distance and six months to accelerate. (Obviously you'll need to accelerate at both ends, but handily the time taken to accelerate actually works out as the total extra time if you do both ends) 

I think that it's fair to say that the effect on the world would be much less marked than if the opposite happened (significant over-population of males) - as it shouldn't affect the birth rate anywhere near as much. Men can clearly father many more children than women can, and can go on siring offspring for a long time. Socially it is possible that polygamy would become far more acceptable, especially in societies where it is felt necessary to keep the birthrate up. Age-difference in relationships would also become more significant. Past that, it would affect the rest of society to some extent; assuming that the issue only lasts for 15 years and basically goes away when it's discovered then the imbalance isn't that great. Whilst your figures would give you 90% females for that period, with its only being around 20% of the average western lifespan you'd only end up with a 42:58% split, which is significant but perhaps not completely world-changing. For example, if you look at any field that's male-dominated and then add 1/3 to the number of women in that field, then you'll probably still find it comes out male-dominated. For example, the UK has 650 members of parliament, fewer than 200 are female (so more than 450 are male). Change that to 260 female MPs, and it's still 390:260 male dominated.
