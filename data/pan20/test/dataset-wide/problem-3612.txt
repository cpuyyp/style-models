That legal "drug" everyone divulges in, alcohol, is a LOT more harmful to your muscle and general health. Alcohol is a testosterone blocker, and does damage to your organs - especially in binge situations. The day after I had a big night out on the liquor my performance in the gym was pitiful. As a person that pushes to the max every workout in reps or weight, I REALLY notice a HUGE difference. If I'm in there a night after a few puffs of the green - no difference. I've been on a strict diet for 4 months (haven't had a drop of alcohol or sugar) and my body fat has dropped 4kg and I've gained 4.5 kg of lean muscle. My deadlift has gone from 160 kg to 220 kg (485 pounds) and I've smoked weed about 3 times a week the entire time. Giddyup! 

Be careful about listening to self confessed YouTube 'guru's like the hodge twins. They aren't intellectuals and whilst mean well, they often have blaring holes in their understanding. They are ok for entertainment value but I personally wouldn't follow anything they said. They have decent physiques, but there is no way to know if they just have good genetics (anything works) or hard gainers that know how to train. This is all neither here nor there, but the 'gurus' that I've talked to that have devoted their lives to muscle building seem to agree on the high reps for legs. The crowd I train with certainly prescribe to this. In fact 50 (yes FIFTY) rep leg press comes up in programming fairly often. 15-20 rep squats are also common (very painful). I feel the white hot pain in those let me assure you! Last week I did 50-40-30-20 reps on leg press. Very painful. I realise this sounds NUTS for someone that has only ever trained in the 12 reps or under ranges. If wikipedia is to be believed, there are predominately type 1 fibres in postural muscles which matches exactly what you said. Since type 1 fibres are endurance tuned, you would definitely aim for fatigue over higher rep ranges to induce an adaptive response. Legs in humans contain closer to 50/50 white(type 2)/red(type 1 & 2) muscle types which matches the kind of training I've been doing. Squats can be as high as 20 reps and as low as 1. Whether we like it or not, we walk around on our legs all day and therefore there are always going to be type 1/2 fibres there and they have to be trained. So to try answer your question, I'm not sure who is advocating doing the same old rep ranges all the time and on all body parts, but I would definitely train hard in a variety of rep ranges. I know as I look around my gym, its the guys confined to their 3 sets of 10 (pick a number) month in month out that grow the least. The single best thing I've ever done is to allow myself to rep up to 20 (and beyond for legs). After 3 years of stagnated training, I was able to gain 6kg (13lb) of muscle in 5 months once I learned how to train properly. 

Unfortunately it is as simple as eating less calories than you burn on paper, but greatly more complicated when you delve into the energy balance equation. Anyone that claims any metabolic or energy system in the body is simple is grossly misinformed. The element of complexity lays in several factors - a few of which are explored here, but mostly it is in your BMR (basic metabolic rate). The calories your body burns to simply function as a couch potato are nearly ALWAYS the VAST majority of the energy you burn throughout the day. As an example, I'm eating 3000 calories a day, and 2100 of those calories are the minimum required to simply keep my organs functioning and to stop my 175 lb body @ 9% body fat from eating itself. So the goal is to force your body to burn more calories without doing hours of pointless, joint straining, and body wasting cardio. Another common misconceptions are created from the over-use of weird 'nothing' words and phrases like 'tone up' and even 'lose weight'. When people want to 'lose weight', what they really want to do is build muscle (tone) and lose fat. Most people don't realise that on a starvation-style catabolic diet (which I consider to be anything under your minimum required calories), you will actually usually lose more muscle than you will fat. Over 50% of that 'weight' lost is actually valuable, attractive, and BMR-boosting functional muscle tissue. These people end up with the infamous skinny/fat physique. They are often visibly thin but still have fairly high body fat % (because of the muscle loss) and still may be in the danger of obesity-related diseases. Your body is clever - if you aren't feeding it enough food, your body will drop your BMR (along with your energy levels) and burn muscle ahead of your fat. Our bodies are adaptive machines. BUILD the body you desire with weight/interval training and your body will ADAPT and become a lean, muscular machine. Eat and Train to force your body to DEMAND more energy. Starving your body of the nutrients it needs is not only unhealthy, but your body ADAPTS to require less and less calories. Your energy levels (a good indicator of your BMR) drop, and your body is ironically tuned to HORDE fat the moment it has the chance (when your diet finishes). This journal article shows how intermittent fasting tells your body to store fat at the next opportunity. The type of exercise is also important. Research has shown that high intensity anaerobic training (weights, sprints) are more effective than aerobic (treadmills, jogging) for burning fat. Anerobic training uses primarily glycogen (sugar) stores in your muscles. While you technically burn more calories doing your hour long jog than during your weight training session, anaerobic exercise burns more calories in the long run. This is due to the 'after-burn' as it is called which is your body replenishing its glycogen stores for up to several hours after your workout. I would highly recommend reading this article, as it explains how staving yourself is NOT the most efficient way to loose weight (contrary to popular belief). Here is what I would recommend: 

You can (and I did month after month) burn fat on a calorie surplus. I'm currently on a 150% calorie surplus and since I'm doing heavy weight training, I'm telling my body to put on muscle to adapt to my ever-increasing intensity in the weight room. As for your plea to not talk about food in weights or calories, well you can't really expect to do random things and expect specific results. I can only achieve fat loss + muscle gain at the same time because I've carefully tuned a diet that enables enough calories to put on muscle. Your body is constantly both burning/storing fat/muscle. It is constantly in both a catabolic and anabolic state. The key is to gain an overall NET catabolic state in the fatty tissue and NET anabolic state in muscle. If you are training hard your body will utilise excess calories for muscle before it does fat. That said, if you eat too much you will put on fat as well as muscle. So the key to a clean bulk is to find that happy caloric intake that SLIGHTLY under optimises protein synthesis for the purposes of burning fat stores for the net difference. Good luck trying to do this eating haphazardly! If you want general advice for food, eat more protein rich foods (naturally lower in calories) and stay away from sugary things. Eat fresh food - stay away from junk food or food that is overly processed. If you aren't getting stronger (or bigger), then eat more! If you are getting fat or not losing fat then eat less. That said, if you want to look like a sports model, you have to train like a freak and eat very clean. I'm 8% body fat because I REALLY watch what I eat and I train very hard. You can't obtain an impressive physique by eating any old thing and doing sloppy training unless you have very impressive genetics. 

The answer to your question is simple. Buy some callipers and pinch the area with the most fat on your body (probably stomach?). Measure with your fingers using belly buttons, nipples, or whatever as a point of reference to ensure you pinch the same point every time. I pinch 3 points, stomach, thigh, side of pectoral. If the millimetres are shrinking over time then be happy :). If not, reduce food intake slightly until you get the right amount. It doesn't matter what body fat percentage you are - it just matters if your skin folds are reducing. I do this once per week. P.S. If your skin folds are shrinking and you are maintaining or gaining weight on the scales - you are building muscle and losing fat at the same time (yes - its possible!) 

Hardness can be a component of how much glycogen has been stored in the muscle (from your diet). Are you eating enough? A well fed gym goer has puffier muscles which are harder upon flexing. If you are cardioing your ass off in between sessions this will deplete the muscle's glycogen stores. That said, I assume that if your muscles are small (as you say), then you want them bigger! I have read about and have had more success with big compound movements which indirectly train arms. Try some bent over DB rows (trains back but overloads biceps). Your biceps will be turned 'on' for the entire bb row set. Chin ups are another great compound for biceps. Your nervous system will never let you load a single small muscle (like the bicep) to its max. Believe it or not, most people have the ability to snap the bicep off the bone but our nervous systems will limit the signal sent so that doesn't happen. That said, you can continue what you are doing but switch to high reps & volume as the way forward with arms. I'm not sure what reps you are doing with the 40 pound dumbbell but pick a weight where you fail at about 20. Do 5 sets of that. Next time pick a weight that maxes at 10 reps and do 10 (yes TEN) sets of that with 1 minute breaks in-between. If you aren't barely able to lift your arms after that then you are a better man than I! Alternating between medium and high training volume will help with recovery while maximising affective work done. This article gives great advice on how to train arms. Excuse the shameless plug for the recomposition clinic within the article! Lastly, don't forget to EAT. 

I'm on a strict diet which consists of 3000 calories 50/30/20 (pcf) consisting of chicken or beef, green vegetables, eggs, bread, and rice. I'm 5'7" and currently about 8% body fat. I have consistently been loosing fat and gaining muscle and I've been happy with my progress. Is it better to polish off a tub of icecream in one sitting or across a cheat day? Is there any evidence that a cheat day is good for you? I've heard stuff that it keeps your metabolism ticking over or something. Is there any truth to this? 

Find a stretch of ground at least 80 meters (yards) or so long Start with a 5 minute stretch with special focus on calves hams Warm up with a few jogs back and forth to warm up the muscles Week 1, start with 'sprinting' 5 80-100 meter lengths Add another length every week (or every few days) until you get to 10 do your sprint session 2 or 3 times a week 

I don't think a single set of deadlifts would be enough volume to grow in my opinion. If I skimp on the deadlift sets (do only 2 sets) I notice I don't gain strength over the next week (assuming you are deadlifting once per week). @DaveLeipmann is right. Don't confuse things and count warm up sets. You shouldn't have to do huge extended warmups that are going to tire you from your performance during your working sets - especially if the first set is as low as 65% of your max. If you pyramid up the weight (and drop the reps) a 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%, is a good 4 set structure. You could divide the 65-95 range into 5 sets, but remember you don't really want to bother training under 65% of your max (the reps get too high to be of much affect). Notice I'm not talking reps - just % of max because I'm assuming you are going more or less to failure in your WORKING sets. If you are doing it right,the first sets are the HARDEST because high reps on deadlifts close to or to failure are VERY HARD (20+reps). 5 reps (about the 90% mark), even if hard, are all over and done with before you know it. A warmup 'warms' up the muscles. You shouldn't be 'training' your muscles as part of your warmup. If my first set was greater than 65% of max, I would do 2 or 3 warmups with graduations of weights going up with reps looking like 10,3,1. If your first set is 65% then you could almost get away with a bit of light stretching or light pumping at a low weight to practice the movement. There is NO point 'warming up' with the weight you are going to use on your first set!! You could be wasting precious reps and not meet your performance targets for that workout. If you are attempting a new 1 rep max, the warmup regime will be more aggressive. I'd start at 10 reps at 50%, 6 reps at 65%, 4 reps at 80%, 1 rep at 90%, 1 rep at 95%, go for gold! I try do these once per month to gauge how I'm doing. If you are doing these once per week, chances are you will be wrecked after the PB attempt and then will skimp on the VOLUME required for the strength increases & hypotrophy to achieve your goals.
