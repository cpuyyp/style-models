Not at all. It wouldn't even make any sense: if you have an object like an atom or a star in gravitational freefall, by the equivalence principle only tidal forces across it are relevant. The tidal forces stretch the object until the internal forces balance them. But for a Λ-driven accelerated expansion, dark energy contribution to tidal forces is constant. Hence, an object already in equilibrium has no reason to further change its size, no matter how long the cosmic acceleration occurs. This also applies to galaxies, only that the internal forces are also gravitational and balance the dark energy contribution. Looking at this in more detail, imagine a test particle with four-velocity $u$, and a nearby one with the same four-velocity, separated by some vector $n$ connecting their worldlines. If they're both in gravitational freefall, then their relative acceleration is given by the geodesic deviation equation, $\frac{D^2n^a}{d\tau^2} = -R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu}u^\mu u^\nu n^\beta$. The gravitoelectric part of the Riemann tensor, $\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\beta = R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu}u^\mu u^\nu$, represents the static tidal forces in a local inertial frame comoving with $u$, which will drive those particles apart (or together, depending). Hence, keeping those particles at the same distance would require a force between them, but it's not necessary for this force to change unless the tidal forces also change. Galaxies don't change size through cosmological expansion. Stars don't either, nor do atoms. Not for Λ-driven expansion, at least. It would take an increase in tidal forces, such as those provided by a Big Rip, for them to do so. A related way of looking at the issue is this: according to the Einstein field equation, the initial acceleration of a small ball of initially comoving test particles with some four-velocity $u$ (in the comoving inertial frame), which is given by the Ricci tensor, turns out to be: $$\lim_{V\to 0}\left.\frac{\ddot{V}}{V}\right|_{t=0}\!\!\!\!= -\underbrace{R_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu}_{\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\alpha} = -4\pi G(\rho + 3p)\text{,}$$ where $\rho$ is density and $p$ is the average of the principal stresses in the local inertial frame. For a positive cosmological constant, $\rho = -p>0$, and correspondingly a ball of test particles will expand. That's cosmic expansion on a local scale; because of uniformity of the FLRW universe, the same proportionality works on the large scale as well, as we can think of distant galaxies as themselves test particles if their interactions are too minute to make a difference. Again, we are led to the same conclusion: if the ball has internal forces that prevent expansion, then those forces don't need to change in time unless the dark energy density also changes, which doesn't happen for cosmological constant. If they're not 'clashing' now, then they won't need to in the future either. 

If we ignore the post-Newtonian parameters other than $\beta$ and $\gamma$, the static post-Newtonian metric is $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1+2\Phi+2\beta\Phi^2\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-2\gamma\Phi\right)\mathrm{d}S_\text{Euclid}^2\text{,}$$ where the Newtonian potential of the Sun is modeled up to the quadrupole term $$\Phi = -\frac{M_\odot}{r}\left[1-J_2\frac{R_\odot^2}{r^2}\frac{3\cos^2-1}{2}\right]\text{.}$$ Deriving the perihelion advance of Mercury with this metric is Exercise 40.5 in MTW, and it matches the general result referenced above with $M\equiv M_\odot+M_{☿} \approx M_\odot$ and sans the middle term. For the Sun-Mercury system, $\mu/M\sim 10^{-7}$, so the middle term is even more irrelevant than bounds on the PPN parameters would suggest. 

Perhaps more fundamentally than temperature, the 'hotness' or 'coldness' of a system can be described by the thermodynamic beta instead, which just like temperature is determined by the rate of change of entropy with respect to energy (at constant volume and particle number): $$\beta\equiv\frac{1}{k_\text{B}}\left.\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right|_{V,N}\!\!=\frac{1}{k_\text{B}T}\text{.}$$ Intuitively, the thermodynamic beta measures the coldness of a system from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. Since temperature per se is just the reciprocal of $\beta$, up to a factor of Boltzmann's constant $k_\text{B}$, that means the coldest is at $T\to 0^+$, approaching zero from positive temperature side, while the hottest is $T\to 0^-$, from the negative. Treating $+0\,\mathrm{K}$ as different from $-0\,\mathrm{K}$ may seem bizarre, but that's what we get for taking a reciprocal. Negative temperatures ($\beta<0$) are hotter than any positive temperature ($\beta > 0$). They can happen when a system has more high-energy states occupied than low-energy states, such as during population inversion of any laser, or during similar astrophysical phenomena. 

The short answer is that the Einstein field equation relates the energy, momentum, and stress of matter to curvature in such a way so that it would be true. We could certainly imagine other relationships between matter and curvature in which the opposite would be the case, or some other stranger things; they just don't resemble how our universe works. I will provide an overview of some facts regarding differential geometry and how they connect to this question. Depending on your background, this may be insufficient as a full explanation, but at least it will provide you with pointers about what to follow up on (although most of it would be more relevant either in math.SE or physics.SE, depending). 

In general relativity, gravity doesn't have to be attractive. For example, inside a perfect fluid with density energy $\rho$ and pressure $p$, $\rho+3p<0$ would imply that gravity is locally repulsive in the sense that a ball of test particles initially at rest expands rather than contracts under gravitational freefall. More generally, the strong energy condition characterizes whether or not gravity is attractive in this sense. However, there is no known material that violates the strong energy condition, besides possibly dark energy, which is a cosmological constant in the standard ΛCDM model, as Gerald says. 

That's not the case. There are four distinct homogeneous and isotropic spatial geometries: the Euclidean space $\mathbf{E}^3$, the hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}^3$, the real projective space $\mathbf{RP}^3$, and the sphere $S^3$. In any of those cases, the universe would look the same all around us and be independent of our position. Thus, the sphere is possible but not necessary. The first two of those cases correspond to the "flat" and "open" Big Bang cosmologies, respectively, and the last two are variations of the "closed" cosmology. And if we don't require the universe to be completely homogeneous and isotropic, but merely look like it in the part of it we observe, then much more exotic geometries are also possible. With cosmological inflation, virtually any large-scale geometry can be "blown up" to look flat, homogenous, and isotropic within our observable portion--even though it might not be s beyond the our cosmological horizon. 

A solar flare is a very hot, violent event that radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. The importance of the H-α line is due to the conveniences of observation. The spectral lines of hydrogen are outside the visible band except for the first four of the Balmer series, from the red H-α line to the violet H-δ line. When an hydrogen ion and an electron recombine into an atom, the result is generally a hydrogen atom in an excited state. Eventually, it decays to the ground state, but it doesn't have to transition directly there, and typically does so in a random sequence of transitions. A very sizable fraction of those transitions, however, include the $3\mapsto 2$ jump that produces the H-α line. Thus, the presence of the H-α line is an easy way to identify ionized hydrogen, and in particular, a sudden brightening of the H-α line in an emission-line spectrum is an indicator that something energetic is happening to ionize the hydrogen (moreso than usual, that is). And that's where the chromosphere, the low-density "atmosphere" surrounding the Sun, comes in: it has an emission-line spectrum, i.e., its spectrum is bright in narrow bands that correspond to its atomic or molecular composition. This is unlike the photosphere, which has an absorption-line spectrum instead. 

The de Sitter spacetime is maximally symmetric, and so having a full set of Killing vector fields, it must have a static form produced by a timelike Killing vector field. One way to get without worrying about coordinate transformations is to take the $M\to 0$ limit of the general spherically symmetric lambdavacuum solution, which is the the Schwarzschild–de Sitter spacetime: $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\Lambda r^2\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-\frac{1}{3}\Lambda r^2\right)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2\,\mathrm{d}\Omega^2\text{,}$$ where $\mathrm{d}\Omega^2 = \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2$ is the usual unit $2$-sphere. Except for minor notational differences, this is also identical to the static de Sitter slicing presented here in terms of different slices of a hyperboloid in Minwkoski $\mathrm{E}^{1,4}$, with $\alpha\equiv\sqrt{3/\Lambda}$. In these coordinates, the timelike Killing field is simply $\partial_t$, which corresponds to a family of static observers with time dilation relative to the static observer at the origin given by $$\dot{t}\equiv\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = \frac{1}{1-r^2/\alpha^2}\text{,}$$ which diverges as $r\to\alpha$. For geodesics, the Killing field also generates a conserved specific energy $\epsilon = \left(1-r^2/\alpha^2\right)\dot{t}$, which makes solving for radial geodesics not difficult. What's interesting about them is they take an infinite amount of coordinate time $t$ to reach $r=\alpha$, but only a finite amount of proper time $\tau$, and they have no trouble at all continuing beyond it. Additionally, time dilation for static observers becomes infinite there. This behavior is analogous to the event horizon of a black hole, except that the location of the de Sitter horizon is dependent on the choice of origin. 

And this is a tiny amount. As you just said, this is the equivalent of about 0.034% of the total mass of stars in the universe, which is in turn constitute but a fraction of the matter in the universe. So why you are surprised that its effect is negligible? It's literally thousands of times less than the uncertainty in the measurements of the amount of matter in the universe. 

An spherical electric charge has the same electric field lines whether spinning or not. The difference between those two cases is entirely in the magnetic field. Thus, one should expect as similar thing to happen for gravity. The parametrized post-Newtonian formalism, weak-field GTR has the metric $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -(1+2\Phi)\,\mathrm{d}t^2 + 2\mathcal{A}_j\,\mathrm{d}t\,\mathrm{d}x^j + (1-2\Phi)\delta_{ij}\,\mathrm{d}x^i\,\mathrm{d}x^j$$ where $\Phi\equiv -U$ is essentially the Newtonian gravitational potential, while $\mathcal{A}_j\equiv-\tfrac{7}{4}V_j - \tfrac{1}{4}W_j$ in terms of the other PPN potentials. For the four-velocity $U^\alpha\equiv{\mathrm{d}x^\alpha}/{\mathrm{d}\tau} = (U^0,\vec{U})$, the geodesic equation for time-independent $\Phi$ and $\mathcal{A}$ becomes, to linear order in $\Phi$, $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{U}}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = U^0(\vec{G} + \vec{U}\times\vec{H})\text{,}$$ where the gravitoelectric field is $\vec{G} = -\nabla\Phi$ and the gravitomagnetic field is $\vec{H} = \nabla\times\vec{\mathcal{A}}$, here $\nabla$ being used in the ordinary sense of $\nabla_i = \partial_i$, i.e. with respect to the Euclidean metric $\delta_{ij}$. If $\Phi$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are not time-independent, then $\vec{G} = -\nabla\Phi - \partial_t\vec{\mathcal{A}}$, paralleling electromagnetism, but there will be an extra term in the analogue of Lorentz force that has no electromagnetic counterpart. Much the same thing can be done in any stationary spacetime, including the rotating Kerr black hole. See also Costa and Natário (2014) for a much more general treatment of several gravito-electromagnetic analogies.
