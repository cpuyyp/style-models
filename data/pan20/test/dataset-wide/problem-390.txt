Nukes would indeed do basically nothing to the sun, it's a nuke far bigger than anything we could ever make continuously exploding for millions of years. Equally anti-matter - you'd need an absolutely monumental amount to even make a dent. This is something a lot of sci-fi writers get wrong. Stars are massive. Absolutely mindbogglingly enormous. To put that in perspective our sun could consume the entire planet earth (in normal matter not anti-matter) and it wouldn't even notice. Throw enough anti-matter into the sun and you will make a big explosion but you would need a LOT of anti-matter. To do what you are talking about you are going to need some exotic physics and some techno-babble. You're talking increasing or reducing the effect of gravity inside the star, or somehow changing the behavior of fusion, or introducing some sort of weird quantum state chain reaction. None of those things are possible using any physics we know about, but then neither is FTL travel so you can quite plausible use the FTL drive as a starting point and create some form of nova bomb. 

The main problem in this scenario is the input of energy. Life on earth is fueled from the surface by sunlight. This is then turned into energy by plants, algae, and suchlike and then the entire food chain is built up from that. Some life can live near the surface of cave networks based on the surface food web (for example it is common for animals to live in caves then emerge to forage or hunt). Cave-dwelling bats would be a classic example of this. To have a sustained ecosystem underground you need a source of energy. Most novels set in these sort of environments (for example the Forgotten Realm's Underdark) that source of energy is magic, which fuels the growth of fungi, and then the food web grows out from that. In a science-based universe though that is not an option so you are left with very few options: 

He won't actually have to do much work, the default position of a scientist is going to be that he's using sleight of hand, etc - so as long as he doesn't do anything that could not be faked then he will be fine. The flying to work is the thing that's going to be a real problem, he shouldn't do that as long distance flying in uncontrolled outdoor spaces would be really hard to explain. The problem you have is that explaining his activities and carnying on as normal are not compatible. Magic breaks any number of physical laws and as soon as he becomes blatant enough and gets enough people interested the fact that he is doing so will pretty soon be obvious. However if he just moderates things a little when in public he can get away with a lot. The best thing is he never has to explain how he does it, he can just say "a magician never reveals his secrets" and let everyone else do the explaining for him... 

What you are describing is impossible, I'm sorry. At the temperatures and pressures involved the rock will flow like water and compress down into a near sphere. An incredibly powerful magnetic field would cause anything affected by the magnets to pull towards the fields but everything else would still flow around them. It would also be unstable, either the magnet wins or gravity wins. The only way to make this happen is to somehow shape the gravitational field in the area or have something incredibly strong pushing the halves apart. The simplest way would be to have two planets (each spherical) next to each other orbiting a combined center. See Rocheworld for example. To give a "cut apple" effect though you will need an alien race to use some beyond-current-conception (i.e. magic) technology to make it happen. Throw in some techno-babble about gravitational fields, spacetime curvature, matter repulsing fields, or something and leave it at that. Keep in mind though that you would not have waterfalls/atmosphere/etc rushing into the crevice. Whatever is repelling the ground will repel that just as well. 

My first thought for a way to achieve this is to have a life form, perhaps an algae of some sort, that lives in the ocean. It lives on the surface and forms massive mats that all link together. The result is that it cuts evaporation of water from the ocean to a tiny fraction of what it would usually be. 

The simple answer is that you can't, but the more complex answer is that if you stretch a few things you might be able to get close. First lets look at the main "problems". The things that stop space combat being like what you want. These are the main 3, although they are not the only ones but you can follow the same process to isolate the others too if they become a problem. 

The catch is it's one zombie per 2 years of necromancer work. So lets say a preserved zombie lasts 20 years, that's still only ten times as long as the necromancer spent creating them, and the zombie is weaker and far stupider than a human doing the same job. The magical city just won't scale, it will do fine at first but as soon as things like mass production start happening none of the things you suggest can keep up. 

This is the fundamental problem with communism. If people aren't rewarded for doing harder/more skilled/etc work and spending the time investment needed to get good at it then why will they bother? Why should I spend 3 years at uni, 10 years learning skills and training myself, etc if at the end of it I get the same salary I could get just by going and stacking shelves at a supermarket? How do you value the employee who comes up with a great idea and optimizes systems so that the shelf packers can do their jobs in half the time vs the one who realizes they get paid the same amount no matter how slow they are so conspires with the other workers to slack off and do their job as slowly as possibly. 

Loot is what they took off the body of the last adventurer to get that far.... ...loot gets better as you get deeper as adventurers that get that far have better gear... ...monsters get stronger as they don't want to be bothered by adventurers poking them all the time so stronger ones live as far away from them as possible....and then steadily weaker monsters are pushed out towards the higher risk edges. A bigger problem is the ecology of the area (how do all these monsters eat for example - each other would be a short term solution) and how the mines/caves/whatever got formed in the first place. Neither of those is easy to explain. 

This all depends, is there a weakness to the illusions? If they are flawless then it is impossible to tell. What you might need to do is have all your people trained to handle illusions and taught techniques to detect them. For example visual illusions might be detected by throwing powder or sand across the area. Invisibility can be detected the same way. Code phrases and passwords can be used to identify individuals. Tricks similar to the spinning top in Inception might also be used, something that you know works one way in illusions but not in the real world. To go into more detail on answers though we really need more information about the scope, nature, strengths and weaknesses of these illusions. 

So as you can see a sea city is entirely feasible. Whether you go the "floating" or "fixed to the floor" route really would depend on local environmental conditions, in the middle of the deep ocean for example floating would be the only option. 

Of course most wizards would not be able to drain people anything like that strongly or that quickly, even a group of wizards working together would not work that rapidly. It would take minutes or hours of combat to bring on these effects, but this example shows exactly why it's something that generally you would only do to enemies...or prisoners! 

This image illustrates it for you. You have periods of high and low water with the current also ranging between a flow in one direction and a flow in the other. At the point in the center of the flow curve you have "slack water" and at that point ships are safe to manoeuvre. You would need a sheltered harbour to keep ships out of the currents and as you say rips, whirlpools, etc would be fierce in the area. So ships would time their passage with their tides, using the current to carry them close but arriving during slack water. They would come into dock and make sure they were secure before the tides picked up again. To leave again they would head out during slack water but timed for when the tides are going in the right direction. As they head out the increasing tidal flow would push them along. 

1920s onwards is recent enough that communication would not be too much slower than today. Anything big everyone would know about worldwide within a day. The telegraph/etc would spread the word to newspapers and newspapers would tell everyone. With the advent of radio even that final step would be faster too. The main difference before the internet was that there was very little "on demand" information. You were reliant on hearing what other people decided to tell you and there was no fast way to get more details. For example if there was a huge fire in Australia you could get the general news about the fire but if you had family in a specific town there would be no way to find out how that town in particular had done. The advent of the telephone would at least let you call for more information. The first long distance lines across america appeared around 1915 but international calls took longer to become possible. 

The simplest way I can see to do it is to give people "Citizenship". You have a citizenship scale where everyone starts at 0 and then accumulates points through contributing to society. Certain events would give automatic citizen points (for example born in country +1000, completing education +1000, further education +1000, each year worked and paying taxes +200, etc). Other actions (vandalism, antisocial behaviour, etc) would cause a reduction in citizen points. At 2000 citizen points or below the basic income would be 0, at 3000 points or above it would be full. There would be a linear scale between those points. This means that if someone is born in the country then as soon as they completes education they are already starting to be eligible. After working a few years or completing further education then they are receiving the full basic income. Immigrants though will be discouraged because they are starting from 0, that means they need to work for 5 to 15 years (depending on education level) before they qualify for the basic income. Additionally because there is no minimum wage and citizens have their wages on top of basic income immigrants have to work and pay taxes on a low wage for several years to qualify. This means that only those people who will work for it and deserve it can get it. 

In the current day, it would take a surprisingly long time. There are isolated tribes that still have very infrequent contact with the outside world. The virus would spread rapidly through the developed world and I'd expect most people to be infected within a few years but there will always be people on isolated bases, in quarantine, in isolated tribes, etc. It would take years longer to reach them, possibly even centuries for some of the truly isolated tribes. There are a lot of scientific studies about the spread of diseases, if you want a detailed analysis you should read up on them. The alien race can vastly speed up the process though, they just need to seed the virus across the atmosphere, ironically focusing on those parts of the world that are least settled and least connected. The connected areas will infect themselves fast enough.
