what are we trying to maximize/minimize? can we calculate the benefits of research in accordance with (1)? can we calculate the harm of lack of informed consent in terms of (1)? Does our utilitarianism permit us to make "harm"-causing actions (vis-a-vis (1)) or are these always illicit? does the species of utilitarianism we are using allow us to make particular bets or require us to consider principles of optimization? (i.e. are we act utilitarians? are we able to calculate on potential gains against real harms) Another ambiguity in Utilitarian accounts is whether the maximization is of (a) actual consequences, (b) reasonably expected consequences, or (c) intentions. This is going to matter a lot for how we can qualify the benefits in (2) against our criteria (1). 

In cluster (a), you're grouping "hypocritical, false, deceitful, and bad faith," but these terms are pretty different in meaning. "hypocrisy" of course referring to offering an argument that you yourself violate or that holds others to a standard you fail. "false" is a word that's problematic to apply to arguments since it either means "lying" or is an inappropriate use of the technical term from the pair true / false which applies to statements -- not arguments. "deceitful" matches the first definition of "false" . "Bad faith" is a term that either means "deceitful" or a technical term from Sartre that mirrors Hegel's unhappy consciousness as an incomplete stage in subjective thought. In cluster (b), the terms might all mean the same thing but might all mean something completely different. And I think this is the real crux of why you draw the conclusion you do. On the one hand, these terms can refer to arguing with someone about their personal behaviors or mores, and in this case, you're probably right that on a psychological level, they aren't really offering an argument for their position and to engage them with an argument and expect that to fit is to misunderstand what's going on. Thus, for "moral ..." understood as raw behavioral modification situations, logic becomes a tool of utility seemingly equal with emotion, bribery, manipulation, etc. But, on the other hand, if they can critically reflect, then they can abstract from themselves to at least some degree. And that's precisely what we're doing in almost all "moral arguments" in philosophy. We are looking at the parameters of what might make an action right or wrong and trying to figure things out systematically. There's no reason to think it's disingenuous to use logic to do this (or at least you don't offer an argument for it above). So the appeal to reason as a way of thinking about what is right to do needn't be made under any of cluster (a)'s problematic set. We can see this sort of thing (where we can reason non-hypocritically about our own morality) as far back as Plato et al. -- where they condemn behaviors they themselves undertake seeing their behaviors as inadequacies. (The same discussion is Aristotle's akrasia). 

Most of Hegel's texts are divided between a terse version and Zusatze ("Additions"). The quote is from an addition which means it's meant (at least in part) to interpret the terser bit rather than to make a novel point. The original part is section (basically like a paragraph) 4 of the Philosophy of Right which states 

It might help to think of a pair of six-sided dice. Let's first consider the number 2. The only way to get the number 2 on two dice is 1 and 1. Thus, there's an identity between rolling a 2 and having the physical state of two dice each showing 1. These two things are thus identical. But then let's consider the number 6. We can get 6 by having a 1 and 5, 2 and 4, or 3 and 3. Thus, rolling a six is multiply realizable. This means its non-identical with any of these particular physical arrangements of dice. Thus if multiple realizability is true about mental states, then type identity is false. And if type identity is true, then multiple realizability is false. 

Sartre's theory in Being and Nothingness isn't especially alive. There are several reasons for this. First, Sartre himself moved past his own theory in some of his later works specifically * Critique of Dialectical Reason* (which are by and large less read). I'm sure you can learn more about that angle in the entry on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. While I've read a decent amount of Sartre, I am most familiar with Part III ("Being for Others"). Here, there are several lines of critique. Sartre's account of how we relate to others is a dialectical approach which in some ways echoes Hegel. But there are elements of his account that are much more negative about human nature than Hegel's. For Hegel, everything will get better and we are meant for community with other humans. For Sartre, we're sex-crazed jerks who want to possess and control others, and the thought of being someone else's object is the most repugnant thing to us. But is Sartre right about this? His most compelling account is about a peeping tom who has the impression of being seen. But there may be other cases that are more appropriate for understanding how humans relate -- parents enjoying being looked at by their babies or such. He mentions this in a footnote explaining that his account presumes there's no possibility of good relationship with others. Second, one could object to phenomenology more broadly and argue that it does not get us to the truth. Instead, they would maintain that we either need to switch to a hermeneutic method, deal with metaphysics proper directly, reduce everything to science, or be skeptical about any of these ideas. Sartre doesn't seem to have much arrayed against this. A further problem is that Sartre's dialectic is one that lacks the possibility of consciousness-together in a positive sense. In other words, it's Hegel stripped of necessity. A third angle of objection is that Sartre doesn't contemplate a world with a prior relationship (God or the Other). This matters because if there is a relational God, then the relational system is utterly changed from his account. This objection's force is that if there's a consciousness there that should have priority over mine, then my weird resistance to getting along is kind of moot. 

We can see him trying to do this starting all the way back in Being and Time where he works on the etymology of certain German words to accomplish his argument (His followers think he's doing great etymology; his detractors disagree). See the SEP entry here Where does this idea come from?
