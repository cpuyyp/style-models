Until rather recently, ä represented the sound /ɛ/, also called "epsilon". This is similar to the sound of e (conveniently written /e/), but with the tongue slightly lower: it's the vowel in English "pet". Some German-speakers still use this pronunciation, but only when they're speaking carefully—that is, it takes conscious effort to get it "right". In casual everyday speech, it's merged into /e/ over the last century. It's not clear what the "original" sound was, but we can make a guess. The process of front-umlaut in German (and other Germanic languages) involved shifting vowels forward in the mouth in certain contexts. ö /ø/ is o /o/ shifted forward, for instance, and the same for ü /y/ from u /u/. So based on this evidence, we could say that the "original" underlying phoneme for ä might have been /æ/, a low front vowel (the sound in General American "cat"). But this is nothing but an educated guess. The difference between the actual sounds [æ] and [ɛ] is rather small, and I don't know of any evidence that would tell us conclusively that it was originally pronounced [æ]. 

This comes down to the ambiguities in the Cuneiform script. Cuneiform doesn't have a one-to-one correspondence between signs and sounds. The sign DIŊIR is a good example. The sign started out in Sumerian meaning an, "heaven". It was used for both the sounds /an/ and for the word an. Because it was pronounced /an/, it started being used for the word An also, the name of the sky god. And this led to it expanding to cover the word diŋir "deity" as well. In Akkadian, this sign was still used for /an/ as in Sumerian, but also for the word il, Akkadian for "deity", or šamû, Akkadian for "heaven". And due to the "deity" meaning it started representing the sounds /il/ in other contexts as well. So now the same cuneiform sign can mean /an/, /il/, šamû, diŋir, or even just indicate that the following word represents the name of a deity. When cuneiform is transliterated into Latin letters, all of these different meanings are conventionally written DIŊIR (in capital letters). It's up to the translator to figure out which of the meanings was actually intended. Similarly, the sign AG can mean the sounds /nabu:/, or Nabû, the god of reading and writing: this last one was written with the two signs DIŊIR-AG, to indicate that it was a divine name. 

The first of these is the easiest to explain: r is a tap, while rr is a trill. In other words, in r your tongue flaps once, like a very short "d", and in rr it flaps several times. Spanish makes this same distinction, written the same way, and recordings should be easy to find: the classic minimal pair is pero "but" / perro "dog". The second and third contrasts are more difficult. In Gheg Albanian the distinction is entirely lost, and this is spreading to some speakers of Tosk Albanian. The sounds written ç and xh are "affricates", like in the English words church and jar. They're pronounced by stopping the flow of air, then releasing the obstruction partially. The sounds written q and gj on the other hand are "plosives", closer to the sounds in English keen and gear, pronounced by blocking the flow of air and then releasing it all at once. English doesn't have Albanian's q and gj as distinct sounds, but they're very close to the pronunciation of English k and g before the vowel in "feed". These sounds also exist in Hungarian, where they're written ty and gy (as in "Magyar"). 

Most likely they're unrelated. Latin lūna "moon" comes from Old Latin losna from PIE *lowks-neh₂, derived from *lewk- "bright, shining". Hebrew l'vaná "moon" comes from the feminine of laván "white". I'm unsure where that goes back to in Proto-Semitic, but it seems to be a native Semitic root because it also appears in Arabic laban "milk". It's not impossible that one influenced the other, but they seem to have unrelated etymologies. Interestingly enough, they both come from a feminine form of an adjective describing the moon. 

(Note: the question has been clarified, making this answer no longer correct. This answer is about affixes, while the question is about suffixes.) Many Bantu languages, including Swahili and Lingála. For example: ni-na-soma 1SG-PRESENT-READ "I am reading" 

Diacritic restoration is a term for guessing the original form of a text, after it's been converted to ASCII in a lossy way. In Lingála, for example, writing in ASCII merges two pairs of vowels and removes all tone markings: the words mɔ́tɔ "fire" and moto "person" aren't distinguished at all. (It doesn't always involve diacritics, as with the vowel letters here, but the name has stuck.) The only diacritic restoration programs I've found for Lingála use a very simple statistical analysis: ASCII "moto" corresponds to moto more often than mɔ́tɔ, therefore all instances of "moto" are restored as moto. But this isn't particularly satisfying: tones and vowel qualities separate thousands of minimal pairs in Lingála (for instance, certain verb tenses are distinguished only by tone). Are there systems out there, for Lingála or other languages, which can take context into account? What are the best models currently used? In other words, what's the state of the art here? 

The English alphabet has had 25 letters at some points in its history. J and V separated from I and U in the mid-1500s, but W was still considered a digraph (like TH) rather than its own letter. 

Phonemes are "mental objects" in the sense that they exist only in the mind: no matter how many recordings you make, and how many formants you analyze, you'll never find some distinctive label on a spectrogram that indicates "this is a phoneme, and this isn't". You could equally well say that, since they only exist in the mind, they're "psychological objects". But just like with different phonemes, the difference between "mental objects" and "psychological objects" is only meaningful in context, and I've never seen an important distinction made between the two. For your final question, "if there is a point to splitting mental from psychological stuff", I would say no. I've never seen such a distinction made in linguistics. 

That's correct. In English, a ditransitive verb (one that takes both a direct and an indirect object) can usually have two different word orders: S V D to I, or S V I D. In other words, "he gave the book to her", or "he gave her the book". In this case, this is the SVID order: it could be rephrased as "the school has given serious consideration to David's proposal", which makes it clearer that the proposal is the indirect object. 

Latin's case system is fairly standard for Indo-European languages. But it's by no means the only option even within that language family. 

Before the Greek alphabet was standardized for political reasons in the fifth century BC, several regional variants also had 25 letters, including glyphs such as Aeolian digamma (Ϝ, pronounced /w/) or Ionian sampi (ϡ, probably pronounced /ts/). 

So as you can see, rendaku isn't completely free from ambiguity. Already-voiced sounds such as /n/, /r/, /j/ aren't affected by it at all, which is what the footnote in the problem is pointing out. But there are also specific words which completely ignore rendaku, or which cause it to happen inconsistently. A few roots become voiced when attached to nouns, but not to verbs. It doesn't help that this voicing isn't indicated at all in kanji writing. In these cases, the ambiguity has to be resolved the same way as in English: context, world-knowledge, and familiarity with the language.
