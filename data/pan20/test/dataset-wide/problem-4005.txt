If $G$ is a group with centre $Z$ such that $G/Z$ is cyclic, then necessarily $G$ is abelian. So no such group can exist. 

How about the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, which computes the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$? 

$R$ is a simple ring : it has no non-trivial two-sided ideals, $R$ has left Krull dimension equal to $1$. This means that $R$ has at least one infinite strictly descending chain of left ideals, and for every chain $I_0 \supseteq I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq \cdots $ of left ideals, there is an integer $N \geq 0$ such that the $R$-module $I_n / I_{n+1}$ has finite length for all $n \geq N$, $R$ is left Noetherian. 

Suppose that $A$ is a not necessarily commutative ring, which is both left and right Noetherian. Given a left $A$-module $N$, and a right $A$-module $M$, there is a general (fourth quadrant, cohomological) spectral sequence due to Ischebeck, with $E_2$ term $$E_2^{p,-q} = \operatorname{Ext}^p_A(\operatorname{Ext}^q_A(N,A),M)$$ which converges to $$\operatorname{Tor}^A_{q-p}(M,N)$$ whenever $M$ has finite injective dimension. If, in addition, $A$ has finite injective dimension $d = \operatorname{id}(A) < \infty$, then whenever $n = q-p$ with $0 \leq q \leq d$ and $p \geq 0$, we must have $n \leq d$. Thus $\operatorname{Tor}^A_n(M,N)$ vanishes for any left $A$-module $N$ and any $n > d$. So, if $M$ has finite injective dimension, then $$\operatorname{fd}(M) \leq \operatorname{id}(A)$$ which gives a positive answer to your question because your ring $A$ is assumed to be Gorenstein, hence has finite self-injective dimension. You can find an English translation of Ischebeck's paper here; see Theorem (1.8). 

This question confuses me, even in dimension two. The non-trivial branched coverings $f$ I can think of are extremely contracting near the branch points. So much so that $f$ is actually expanding elsewhere to produce enough area. 

The definition of the "curve complex" $C(Y)$ is altered when $Y$ is an annulus. Instead of using isotopy classes of essential curves they use isotopy classes rel endpoints of essential arcs in the Gromov closure of $\tilde{Y}$. The classes downstairs (in $S$) lift to the correct classes upstairs (in $\hat{Y}$, the Gromov closure). 

Yes. If the splitting surface $F$ is strongly irreducible then, after an isotopy you can assume that $T$ meets each of $H_1$ and $H_2$ in collections of disjoint incompressible annuli. This has been independently proved by Kobayashi, Thompson, and Hempel. For references, please see the bibliography of Hempel's paper "3-manifolds as viewed from the curve complex". 

In general, it is not true that $Ann_R(M)$ is a maximal two-sided ideal of $R$ if $M$ is a simple $R$-module. For example, let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}_2(k)$ and let $A = U(\mathfrak{g}) / \langle C \rangle$ where $C$ is the Casimir element. Then the Verma module $V$ of highest weight $-2$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ is a simple faithful $A$-module (so $Ann_A(V) = 0$), but the zero ideal in $A$ isn't maximal since it's contained in the proper two-sided ideal $\mathfrak{g}\cdot A$. Annihilators of simple modules are called primitive ideals; whilst any maximal two-sided ideal $I$ in a ring $R$ is necessarily primitive (simply pick a maximal left ideal $J$ containing $I$ and consider the simple module $R/J$), the converse is not true as the above example shows. As Ralph notes, in the general setting of non-commutative rings, the localisation $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$ does not exist: one needs certain Ore conditions to be satisfied by the set $S$ of elements in $R$ that are non-zero-divisors modulo $\mathfrak{m}$. Even if the Ore localisation $R_\mathfrak{m}$ exists, it could happen that the Ore localisation $M_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is zero. This is actually the case for the $A$-module $V$ considered above: since $A$ is a Noetherian domain, the set $S$ of all non-zero elements of $A$ is an Ore set, but $V$ is a torsion $A$-module so $V_S = 0$. It's known that $pd_A(V) = 1$ in this case, so the inequality $pd_R(M) \geq pd_{R_{\mathfrak{m}}}(M_{\mathfrak{m}})$ is strict in general. In the positive direction, however, it is known that flat dimension behaves well under Ore localisation. More precisely: suppose that $S$ is a two-sided denominator set in a ring $R$ and let $N$ be an $R_S$-module. Then the flat dimension of $N$ as an $R_S$-module is equal to the flat dimension of $N$ as an $R$-module; this is Proposition 7.4.2(iii) of the book Noncommutative Noetherian Rings by McConnell and Robson. For a finitely generated module $M$ over a Noetherian ring $R$, flat dimension coincides with projective dimension (see section 7.1.5 of the book cited above). This is enough to give a positive answer to your question under the following extra hypotheses: 

Fact number one: since $S$ and $H$ are Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, there is a map $f \from S \to H$ inducing $f_*$. Fix a cut system $D \subset H$: that is, a collection of $g(H)$ disks so that $H - n(D)$ is a three-ball. Homotope $f$ to make it transverse to $D$. Thus $C = f^{-1}(D)$ is a collection of simple closed curves in $S$. For any $\alpha \subset C$, let $D(\alpha)$ be the disk containing $f(\alpha)$. We now construct a graph $G$. We have a vertex $v(X)$ for every component $X$ of $S - C$. We have an edge $e(\alpha)$ for every component $\alpha$ of $C$. We connect one (both) end(s) of $e(\alpha)$ to $v(X)$ if one (both) side(s) of $\alpha$ are contained in $X$. Note that $G$ is a finite connected graph. Recall that the genus $g(S)$ is the number of curves we must cut $S$ along to obtain a connected planar surface. In similar fashion we define the genus $g(G)$ to be the number of edges we must remove from $G$ to obtain a tree. Define a map $r \from S \to G$ as follows. All points of $X - n(C)$ are mapped to $v(X)$. The open annulus $n(\alpha)$ is sent to the edge $e(\alpha)$ by crushing the circle coordinate. Deduce that $g(G) \leq g(S)$. We also observe that $r$ induces an epimorphism $r_* \from \pi_1(S) \to \pi_1(G)$, a free group of rank $g(G)$. [This much of the proof implies that $\pi_1(G)$ can only surject free groups of at most half the rank of $\pi_1(S)$.] Fix a point $x \in H - D$. We now define a map $h \from G \to H$ as follows. The map $h$ sends all vertices of $G$ to $x$. The edge $e(\alpha)$ is sent to any loop based at $x$ and meeting $D$ exactly once, transversely, at a point of $D(\alpha)$. (I am ignoring a small issue about orientations here.) We deduce that $f_* = h_* \circ r_*$. Thus $h_* \from \pi_1(G) \to F$ is an epimorphism. Fact number two: since free groups are Hopfian, $g(G) = g(S)$ and $h_*$ is an isomorphism. We now construct a handlebody $H'$, homotopy equivalent to $G$. Take $S$, thicken to get $S \times [0,1]$, and attach two-handles along the curves $C \times \{0\}$. We next attach three-handles to the sphere components of the lower boundary. We identify the groups $\pi_1(H')$ and $\pi_1(G)$. Let $i' \from S \to H'$ be the inclusion map. Fact number three: using Nielsen's theorem (giving generators of $\Aut(F)$), there is a homeomorphism $h' \from H' \to H$ inducing $h_*$. Consider the homeomorphism $k = (\bdy i)^{-1} \circ \bdy h' \circ \bdy i'$, where all domains and ranges are restricted to be $S$. Chasing the diagram of spaces shows that $i_* \circ k_* = f_*$, and we are done. 

Since $A$ is regular local commutative ring, it's an integral domain. Let $S = A - 0$ so that the localisation $A_S$ is the field of fractions $F$ of $A$. Assuming the algebra $A$ is central in $R$, $S$ is a central multiplicative subset in $R$. So we can localise at it and form the localised $F$-algebra $B := R_S$. The corresponding canonical $B$-bimodule $B^\ast = Hom_F(B,F)$ is the localisation of $\omega_R$ at $S$, so we see that $\bullet$ if $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ is torsion-free as an $A$-module then $B^\ast \otimes_B M_S$ is non-zero. So in the case when $A$ is already a field, your question is equivalent to asking whether $B^\ast$ is a faithful right $B$-module. This is not true in general: here is an example. Let $B$ be the upper-triangular $2 \times 2$ matrix ring with entries in a field $F$, so $B = F e_{11} \oplus F e_{12} \oplus F e_{22}$. Then you can compute that the action of $B$ on $B^\ast = Fe_{11}^\ast \oplus Fe_{12}^\ast \oplus F e_{22}^\ast$ satisfies $e_{22}^\ast \cdot e_{12} = e_{22}^\ast$ $e_{11}^\ast \cdot e_{11} = e_{11}^\ast$, and $e_{12}^\ast \cdot e_{11} = e_{12}^\ast$. So if $J$ is the maximal ideal of $B$ spanned over $F$ by $e_{11}$ and $e_{12}$ then $B^\ast\cdot J = B^\ast$ which forces $B^\ast \otimes_B (B / J) = 0$ and shows that $B^\ast$ is not a faithful right $B$-module. In the positive direction, it is enough for $R$ to be a Frobenius extension of $A$ for $\omega_R$ to be isomorphic to $R$ as an $R$-bimodule; then of course $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ is just $M$ as an $R$-module and therefore $A$-torsionfree. You can find more information about Frobenius extensions in a paper by Bell and Farnsteiner: $URL$ 

See this page by Coornaert for an introduction and references. In particular, finitely generated hyperbolic groups are always finitely presented (so you don't need to add that condition). Also, the referenced page suggests that your first question, about finite index torsion free subgroups, is open. I looked in various references for your related question, but didn't find anything. Edit: Aha! I finally looked in the right place. Apparently your related question is also open. 

There are numerous algorithms to decide this question. At bottom all of these are based on the "monogon" and "bigon" condition: If $\alpha$ is a closed loop on a surface then we can homotope $\alpha$ to realize its minimal self-intersection number by looking for and then removing mongons and bigons. For an example of such a paper, see Chillingworth's "Winding numbers on surfaces. II". For a related discussion, see section 1.2.4 of the "Primer on mapping class groups" by Farb and Margalit. There is also a more geometric criterion having to do with "linking at infinity." See section 8.2.4 of the Primer. 

Pick $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}_p \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ and define $H = \left\lbrace\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & a \cr 0 & 1 & \lambda a \cr 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} : a \in \mathbb{Z}_p\right\rbrace$. Then $H$ is a closed subgroup of $Tr_1(3,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ but $H \cap Tr_1(3,\mathbb{Q})$ is the trivial group, hence certainly not dense in $H$. 

Following on from Martin Brandenburg's remark, to answer the question in the negative it is enough to find a ring $R$ with no zero-divisors which has a non-reversible ring ($S$, say) as a proper homomorphic image. In a reversible ring, the right annihilator of an element is also its left annihilator, and as such, a two-sided ideal. So any simple ring with zero divisors is not reversible. For a concrete example, we can take $R$ to be the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $S$ the ring of $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{C}$. Since $R$ has an irreducible two-dimensional module (the natural representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$), there is a surjection $R \twoheadrightarrow S$. Then $R$ is a domain, hence reversible, and $S$ is a simple ring with zero divisors, hence non-reversible. Indeed, if $e_{ij} \in S$ are the standard matrix units, then $e_{12}e_{11} = 0$ whilst $e_{11}e_{12} \neq 0$.

Twisted torus knots are mostly hyperbolic, and in particular prime. The following paper can serve as an introduction to the literature. $URL$ 

For the thrice-punctured sphere, there is a generating set where both generators are parabolic. For the once-punctured torus only the commutator (and its conjugates) is parabolic. Hence any element that can be part of a generating set is hyperbolic. Thinking in the upper half-plane model of $\mathbb H$, the Farey set is the rational points of the real line (plus the point at infinity). If $X$ is a punctured hyperbolic surface then the lifts of the ideal points of $X$ likewise form a dense set in the real line. If $X$ is a thrice-punctured sphere then, after possibly conjugating the deck group by an isometry of $\mathbb H$ the lifts of the punctures are the Farey set. However, for any other surface $X$ this only happens if the modulus of $X$ is carefully chosen. 

Over a general ring (not necessarily commutative), every finitely presented flat module is projective. So, one simple condition on the ring that gives you what you want is that every finitely generated module is finitely presented. Of course, these are just the (left) Noetherian rings. 

I don't have a full answer, but the following calculation may be useful. Consider the example $G = SL_3$ so that $N$ is the Heisenberg group on three generators and in characteristic zero, $\bar{U}(N)$ is the enveloping algebra of the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. Thus $\bar{U}(N) = k[x,z][y ; z \frac{d}{dx}]$ is a skew polynomial algebra. This notation means that every element in $\bar{U}(N)$ can be written uniquely in the form $\sum_{i=0}^r f_i y^i$ for some $f_i \in k[x,z]$ and $y$ satisfies the commutation relation $ad(y)(f) := y f - f y = z \frac{df}{dx}$ for any $f \in k[x,z]$. Note that $z$ is a central element in $\bar{U}(N)$. Now consider the element $y^a \cdot x^b$ for any $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us rewrite it in standard form as follows: $y^a x^b = l_y^a(x^b) = (r_y + ad(y))^a(x^b) = $ $\left(\sum_{i=0}^a\binom{a}{i} r_y^{a-i} ad(y)^i \right)(x^b) = \sum_{i=0}^a \binom{a}{i} \frac{b!}{(b-i)!}z^i x^{b-i} y^{a-i}$. Here $l_y$ and $r_y$ are operators of left-multiplication by $y$ and right-multiplication by $y$, respectively. Note that they commute, so $r_y$ and $ad(y) = l_y - r_y$ also commute, so the application of the binomial theorem is legal. So in this case you can take $f(a,b) = a + b - \max(a,b)$. 

I believe that this is Theorem 1.4.6 (predicate calculus) in the book "Word processing in groups". However, I find their discussion somewhat confusing -- I came here hoping for a better reference... 

EDIT - Maxime has answer the question in the comments. The desired $h$ is not a function of the lengths $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3$, but rather lies in an open interval. The minimum (resp. maximum) of $h$ is achieved by sewing the first circle shut so it lies along a concentric (resp. radial) arc of the resulting annulus. See Figure 46e in Nehari's book for a picture of the concentric case. I wrote the following under the assumption that there is a unique best way to attach a disk. I'll leave it here as it seems like a particularly nice intermediate case. %%% It suffices to answer the following question. Fix six real numbers $A = \{a_0, a_1, \ldots a_5\}$ with $a_i < a_{i+1}$. We construct a right-angled hexagon $H_A$ in the complex plane by connecting $a_0$ to $a_1$, connecting $a_2$ to $a_3$, and connecting $a_4$ to $a_5$ by line segments, contained in the real axis. We then connect $a_5$ to $a_0$, connect $a_1$ to $a_2$, and connect $a_3$ to $a_4$ by arcs of circles orthogonal to the real axis, contained in the upper half plane. $H_A$ appears to have six degrees of freedom, but these are reduced to just three after translating, scaling, and applying a Mobius transformation that preserves the real axis as well as $a_0$ and $a_5$. One must uniformize this hexagon (ie compute the hyperbolic lengths of the sides) to answer your question. I think this is a variant of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, but I failed to find a reference after looking for a bit. Perhaps look in Nehari's book "Conformal mappings". That done, it is easy to double the hexagon across the real axis and apply a Mobius transformation to make the sides corresponding to $l_2$ and $l_3$ concentric. The log of the ratio of their radii now gives the desired modulus.
