Is it this monotheism the point of contact by which Plotinus was able to weld the two traditions together? 

I haven't heard of this parable, but it is a disguised form of Aristotles principle of sufficient reason. This is not to say that Aristotle was the first to determine it, but the first I know that recorded it. 

This, like Smolins notion of the Multiverse, is predicated on change being eternal as opposed to having an origin - which is the position Aristotle takes; though, it may be possible he is theorising the origin of one world amongst many. 

So also painters like Munch, Schiele or Bacon. Notice the close connection Sontag implicitly assumes to Agathon, even for art born in affliction - it affirms it's authenticity. But the proverb is not referring to any of this, but purely to subjectivity; it's comparable to another proverb: 

It might be useful to align this with another 'two cultures' paradigm in science which to most layman are very similar: that of physics and mathematics. Physics has been inspired by mathematics - Newtonian physics would be unimaginable without the differential calculus; Einsteins General Relativity would have been still-born without the technology of tensor calculus developed by Riemann and Ricci. Mathematics has been inspired by physics - non-commutative algebra were a curiousity (the quaternions of Hamilton) until Quantum Mechanics gave it new impetus. Heisenberg for example knew nothing about matrices before he developed matrix mechanics (along with Dirac). But given all this, they have different goals, languages & cultures. The same theory is studied in different angles. A mathematician talking about GR in the language of (coordinate-free) Differential Geometry is (almost) incomprehensible to a physicist brought up in (exceedingly coordinate heavy) Tensor Calculus. In the very long view physics began without mathematics: for example the early cosmologists and atomists in Miletus. There are physicists and mathematicians that straddle the divide. A famous one who does is Witten, another is Borcherds. Similarly there are philosophers who also cross the continental and analytic bridge. Nussbaum for example writes on the philosophy of law and the emotions in the analytic mode; but her choice of subject is continental; Jessica Frazier write on Indian Metaphysics drawing on the continental heritage ie Heidegger and Gadamer, but her style has the clarity of analytic school rather than the obscurity of Heidegger. Climate change was discovered by a whole of scientists but forms a thread in eco-philosophy; for example in the short works of the Norwegian Arne Naess, for example in his essay A Plea for Pluralism in Physics and Philosophy he writes as you have put: 

In the 13th thesis of the Incoherence, Al-Ghazali refutes the claim of the falsafa (peripatetic) philosophers that particulars aren't knowable by the First. Is this claim made on the basis that particulars aren't knowable by the intellect, but that essences are; that is when, I pick up a pebble, I don't know it intellectually, but by the fact that I hold it in the palm of my hand; I know it by sense-data: I can feel it's weight - small though it is; and see it's dark grey colour? 

It might be worth going back to when the term Event was first introduced by Derrida in his paper Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences presented at a conference in the US to investigate & ratify the idea of Structuralism, but was soon recognised as the beginning of post-structuralism primarily due to Derridas paper. He writes: 

She remarks, also in places, that these ethical considerations for arose out of her studies of Jewish Philosophy - she names Martin Buber as a source. It's worth noting too, that the question assumes - or perhaps I am making this assumption - that the primary site of struggle here is national 'governments'; but Homi Bhabha, in his foreword to Fanons Wretched of the Earth, points out: 

Use types: So that x:Apple, y:Orange This means that x is an apple, y is an orange. Then we cannot even compare oranges to apples - they're not of the same type; showing that they must be different. If one had an additional type Fruit from which these descend, then the types Orange and Apple would be comparable; but this would be additional type information that is unneccessary to implement and demonstrate the question asked by the OP. It's also worth noting that in an actually existing type system like Haskell, it would not be legal to construct two types of the same nature and name. 

I don't consider the following to be a full answer in the terms given; but it may help, or you may know this already. It looks like Hegels solution to the problematic set out in Aristotles Physics, on the number of principles (arche) of nature: a contrary acting on another; and A struggles to say whether this is two, or three; Hegel turns this into one; which is immanently a dyad, which it immediately and overcomes - hence an 'identity'. When the overcoming is transcendental, Laruelle is writing this as 2/3; and when immanent 3/2 - which is a neat allegory in mathematical terms to summarise the content of the above - recalling that a fraction is one number, and that inverting fractions is a useful thing to do with fractions and that transcendence and immanence have opposite or inverse senses. 

Reading helps, but did only reading help with mathematics? Perhaps it did, particularly early on, but to enter into the spirit of mathematics today, especially as it is today, takes a certain serious devotion: Questions must be posed, and answered; the real structure of a proof understood, as well as variants and all this must come, somehow naturally - this is the process of subjective dialectic as dramatised in the dialogue above. It's no different to any other field that has rigour - political philosophy included; this is if real knowledge is sought (and I mean real in the sense of your own questions); however it is true that strong opinions strongly and articulately held often count as knowledge - it's this that Socrates skewers in the Sophist (which doesn't mean that the skill of polemic and rhetoric if done rightly is not a virtue - this is in part, the nature of good journalism).
