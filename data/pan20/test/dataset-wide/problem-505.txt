I have a 5 speed freewheel that I need to take of from hub, but the standard freewheel tool that I do have does not fit. On the freewheel following text is engraved: UC SHIMANO SIS MF Z015 China It seems to me that tool would need to have 12 splines. 

Modifying frame is usually not worth the trouble. Maybe your bike was previously equipped with gears, and it has necessary provisions (derailleur hanger)? If not consider a hub with internal gears. If that is too expensive, consider a new bike. 

It is quite hard to locate origin of sound like that. Since sound comes from critical area, where some of the failures might result in loss of teeth or worse, I would suggest through approach. After eliminating simpler problems like skewers and bolts not tight enough (too much), or bearing issues, I would suggest disassembling whole stem/headset/fork assembly and carefully inspecting it in detail with magnifying glass for dentures, cracks, or anything out of ordinary. 

New tires are puncture resistance, not proof. It is possible to cut them so they can not be used. I keep old tires, as a quick fix for such situations until I can buy new ones. Also I frequently go to the cottage house with bicycle (cca 60km). So I keep one old spare tire there. 

Numbers denote number of teeth on smallest cog i.e. 11-32 has smallest cog with 11 teeth, and largest with 32 teeth. 11-32 gives you larger range of transmission ratios while 12-25 gives you smoother steps between the speeds. When calculating which one to choose also take into account number of teeth you have in front, and the kind of terrain you would like to drive. Also make sure your rear derailleur has capacity to consume chain slack for your given combination 

On M542 crank set and 68 mm BB shell, I use one spacer on the left, and 2 on the right. I think that on 68 mm shells you always use all 3 spacers, and distribute them on the left/right side to get chain line you need. 

That bicycle you had long time ago had rear brake (actuated by pedals turning backwards), the one you have now has no rear brake and you have to fight force of inertia with your feet to stop it. One might be tempted to add that this is the exact reason why brakes were invented and added as standard equipment to bicycles. 

Did anyone tried using yaktrax ice-traction device for shoes when using bicycle (with flat pedals)? I have noticed that often very large risk of falling in icy conditions is when mounting dismounting, and yaktrax seems like it could be of help in such situations. Anyway I am concerned if yaktrax might tangle into the pins of the pedal and lock my feet. 

Sheldon Brown, has a page with headset dimensions. According to him, some Austrian frames have slightly larger headset cup size 30.8 compared to standard one 30.2. So maybe you have old Austrian frame? $URL$ 

Assuming that basics are in order and that you are using properly sized tires and inflating them to proper pressure, typical route to get more puncture resiliency is to use different tires with better puncture protection, not different tubes. It reduced my puncture frequency dramatically, I expect it would also help you. 

I suspect that in spite of cleaning, there are still some sharp leftovers in the puncture site. You can try to get them out. Since you have glued the puncture spot, that might turn out to be quite difficult if not impossible. Personally, I would call it quits after 5-6 punctures, and get myself a new tire. 

I will tackle just the question what can be done to prevent such accidents in the future. I think that in some cases loud horn can help the prevent accidents where motorist is not aware of the cyclist. I was recently in an accident where I was on the main road and motrosit was approaching on side road. He was driving in faster spectrum but many other motorist approach main road in that manner and stop. This one did not, since he did not see me, and hit me in the rear wheel. I was much more lucky than you since I got only few bruises. But I decided and ordered loud horn for my bike which I intend to use on any suspucious looking motorist. 

I carry the chain wrapped around seat post and locked on the rack. It tends to scratch the paint on the frame that way though. 

I have a beater commuter steel bicycle that is subject to all kinds of weather, abuse and a lots of scratches. Several hot-spots on the frame have appeared over the time where most of the damages and corrosion happens. I was thinking of protecting those spots by: 

If there is decal of the manufacturer, you might be lucky to find the man who made it, and with serial number you might ask him original price, and how much he would charge for repair or substitute frame. 

I have lost track of actual numbers, but in my experience bicycle was several times cheaper than car. However, bicycle was still much more expensive than public transportation for me. This was due that bicycle maintenance is actually quite expensive, and that bicycle can not be used for some days (for instance weather is particularly bad, or the bicycle is in service) so other means of transportation need to be payed for that day 

There are people who are making custom parts for bicycles, also stems in particular. Whole bicycle frames as well. But it is a non trivial craft that takes time, practice and determination to master properly. Not to mention that failure of some parts can cause serious injuries, so tread carefully. 

Once I was hauling some long boards, so I wrapped parts of frame and brake cables with cheap painters tape (one that is more like paper). After some rain and sun it looked quite ugly. 

Personally I would not stretch it that far. Aside from spacing you should check if your frame has derailleur hanger, and cable stops. Lastly you would have to ensure proper chain line after the stretch, possibly requiring BB and/or crank set change. 

Also check condition and if there is significant play in you bottom bracket. When standing, you put maximum pressure on the bottom bracket and maybe it is tilting, and moving position of chain. If neither chain or BB replacement help, it might be that you are just u big person on gentle frame, and frame flexes under the load you are putting it under. 

It would be best if you could get 16 hole rim (yeah I know the may be hard to find). Holes on the rim go in the zig-zag pattern, and since you skip every second, all your spokes are on one (zig) side of the wheel. This is less than ideal, and in my humble opinion bigger concern than rain coming in empty holes. 

I would round to 294, since that would keep difference from theoretical less than 1 mm, and as bonus left and right would be of same length which means you have to stock only one size for replacements. 

Well, I think it is not the fact that it is inside the tyre, but you are probably inflating it to much larger pressure when inside the tyre. At larger pressure tube starts to leak. 

178kg would put significant strain on most off the shelf bicycles. Most critical parts would be wheels, bottom bracket, crank set, and suspension if any. I would suggest that you go to your local bike shop and have custom assembled bicycle for you with: 

To setup bicycle computer you need to find out circumstance of your wheel in mm. Most reliable way I know is the following. 

I have double kickstand on the bike which can act as mini repair stand. I pull the bike on the kickstand, and put some weight (u-lock and chain) on the front of the bike so it tilts forward and back wheel gets lifted in the air. 

I do not think anything bolted on could be good enough. Since it is aluminum frame, brazing or welding the bosses would also be complicated. But instead of replacing the whole frame, you might just change front fork with one that has bosses. That way on front where it makes more difference you would have V-brake, and on the rear you could have long reach caliper brake.
