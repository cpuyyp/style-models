If so, then I do not understand how Nagel arrives at or concludes 2. Why is 2 a necessary premise? To what exactly? 

I do not understand 2. Does the author contradict herself: because per 1, does not the 'search for explanation' point toward our 'feel[ing] satisfied until we have adequate explanations'? Why would Aristotle think 3? What if we did not 'exploit' nature, but rather tried to use it morally? 

Google revealed only this Wikipedia article, but which is poorly written; for example, it uses pronouns ambiguously and fails to disambiguate the pronoun's antecedents. 

Source: Benatar, David. Better Never to Have Been (2008 1 edn). pp. 41-42. I don't understand the nuances in 1 and 3 beneath. 2 states that absent non-privative pleasures are not bad. So don't 2 + 'not worse' imply 'neutral'? 

The answer key on p 220 specifies (a), which I accept because (a) implies that one has educated oneself on a practical necessity by experience. But why is (d) incorrect? For daily life, reading Shakespeare is less practical than (a), but less practicality does not imply less true reading.

I do not comprehend only the step bolded above: How does Rule 4 imply that both premises must be affirmative? 

Posner tries to weaken and counter analogy 1 by analogizing wth a ridiculous analogy 2, but I don't understand what's weak or unconvincing about 2? In 2.2, the fundamentalist Christian student can dodge flunking only if she expresses evolution (e.g. on a test). But even if she avers (whenever expressing evolution) that she's only expressing evolution without espousing it, she may still be sinning as she's expressing a false belief. Her fundamentalism still mandates her to express that creationism is right, and evolution wrong. 

I know that Kant was a deontologist, but appearing to presuppose unreasonably too much, 1 does not convince me. Here is an answer to 2 that rebuts 1: Suppose that most honest people's speaking does evidence the assumption in 2 (that the honest people try to communicate something); but unfortunately, not having studied Logic at university, they may unintentionally commit Logical Fallacies. Then these honest people did not speak honestly, but they did INTEND to speak honestly? 

I know no philosophy, so would someone please explain the meaning of the bolded, basically and simply (without cant or abstract parlance)? How does 'donating' imply the above? Wouldn't bona fide donation confirm and improve our morality?

What does the bolded sentence mean? The translated nouns (in grey) daze me the most. Why does Kant metaphorize 'natural necessity' as a 'road', but 'freedom' as a 'footpath'? 

Why cannot 1 (the explanation for Inferentialism) equally apply to Pluralism to explain the underlying uniter of Pluralism? I.e.: cannot we argue that pluralism 'unite[s] the family of causes' ? 

But what if sentiments and feelings that support doing the right thing and the reason for acting are too intertwined? Then where do you draw the line? Am I right that Sandel assumes (tacitly) that every human can differentiate between them? What if you can't differentiate them? 

Consider the subject of physics. While high school students may memorise and then use the results (e.g. physics equations like e = m·c^2), they would not be judged to have learned the equations, if they do not learn the proofs or the intuition behind these equations. Next consider the more subjective subject of history. How are 2 and 3 true? Does not everything after 5 apply to history? If no evidence exists (e.g. Proto-languages), then facts might never be known; but even if known, historians may still disagree on a fact in question. 

How can these philosophical texts be judged as 'great works of literature' alone? Please help me to distinguish between philosophy and (philosophical) literature. These Reddit posts by 'SocratesJones', by 'slickwombat', by 'singdawg' didn't help.

But without computers, for a given collection of > 10 long convoluted premises: What if the conclusion were concealed or tacit? How can you determine it yourself?

Is it fair and logical to blame soldiers who still fight tenaciously for their vile countries, for promoting evil and protracting the fight against righteousness? Are such soldiers disingenuous? Accordant with 1, virtuous soldiers ought to try to diminish their actions, essentially by 'going easy' on their 'enemy'. For example, if Erwin Rommel or these U-Boat commanders truly despised war and wanted peace, why didn't they ease off, like Wilhelm Canaris? I ask the same for the Imperial Japanese Forces; why did Isoroku Yamamoto (who opposed fighting the US) not flout his duties as did Sōkichi Takagi? For example, a U-Boat captain could've targeted a stronger area of an enemy vessel to minimise damage to the Allies, or even pretend to a miss, so I don't understand such empathy and forgiveness as follows: 

I do not understand the grey above, but do understand all else. [4.] Why can only IND determine END? Eg: an IND for a cat may not resolve unclear and vague cases; eg, some strange felid hybrid may match all your attributes, but may still not be a cat. [5.] Why cannot ? 3 implies that only , but to me, END appears equally effective as IND? For example, detailed information (eg: physical evidence, pictures, videos) of 95% of all cats may inform more about cats than any IND.

What abstract distinctions between 1 and 2 have I neglected? I do not understand 3 and 4: because one necessary condition for 'bread nourishes' is: the bread is not poisoned (with bacteria). They are mutually exclusive. 5: how can no change in any cause still cause completely different effects? With no change in any cause, how can nourishing bread suddenly mutate into poisoned bread?

I rewrite 1 and 2 above, as 3 (the material conditional equivalent of 1) and 4 (just the contrapositive of 3). The bolded implies the truth of 3. R's desire to avoid S, implies the falsity of 4. So how do 1 and 2 differ from 3 and 4? Besdes grammatical tense, all looks identical to me!

I wish to understand 1 universally, independent of physics if possible because I know nothing of it. What exactly does 1 mean? 

I also read this blog post. Why is it reasonable to opine Mill's view (see 1 above) as Victorian? 1 does not appear Victorian to me, because 1 does dominate and guide the education systems and (academic) parenting of Western society in 2016? I.e.: Schools today teach, and academic parents today would likely encourage their children to pursue, the higher pleasures instead of the lower pleasures. 

A novice, I do not feel prepared yet to read Nietzsche; but please tell me if his primary sources answer my question. Source: p 98, Philosophy ; A Very Short Introduction (2002) by Edward Craig. The following quotation discusses The Genealogy of Morals. 

This question interprets everything to be other subjects besides philosophy (because it is tautological that excelling in philosophy helps you to learn better philosophy). If anyone needs an example of another subject to discuss, please take law (one of my other interests, and I already know of the existence of philosophy of law). 

Then the above tension will be overcome by the idea that we deal with each other on the basis of law, justice armed with power. 5. Conclusion Absolute, Spirit and Dialectic: I think these three notions are the main building blocks of Hegel’s philosophy. I also hope to have shown that Hegel with the conception of his philosophy is thoroughly indebted to Kant. Books I found very helpful understanding Hegel were: R. Pippin Hegel Idealism, Cambridge 1999 (?) H. Marcuse Hegels ontologie und die Theorie der Geschichtlichkeit, W. Jaeschke Hegel Handbuch Metzler Verlag 2003. (In Dutch) Hegel een Inleiding ed.

I do not comprehend how the bold is true, even for epistemology. For example, suppose that I lack knowledge of epistemology. Then this lack would inspire me to learn about epistemology, after which I will have gained truly positive knowledge. So does my example attest that absence of something can generate something positive? 

How are the 2 italicised sentences correct? They appear to debase and denigrate the green which (to me) appear truly important, because: am I correct that the green expressions match, and so assert, the red ('S are P')?

Kant's use of the Loan Word 'noumenon' appears to contradict its original meaning in Greek; to what thinking or perception can nooúmenon refer, if humans can never perceive, understand, or think about noumena? Did Kant intend a semantic shift?

I do not comprehend the reason behind the last sentence above (that I coloured in grey). If Locke meant Qualities, then why did he still write 'ideas' instead of simply writing 'Qualities'? 

I pursue only intuition; please do not answer with formal proofs or Truth Tables. The argument above does not convince me, because why must 1 be true (ie: why must the MID be contained wholly in MAJ)? An affirmative conclusion can follow even if the MID is contained partially in MAJ. For example, consider an III syllogism ♦which is invalid: Some A are B. Some B are C. → Some A are C. However, this becomes valid if at least one element lies in A ∩ B ∩ C.

To me, 4 appears to mean:   9. But our evaluation of the premises affects our evaluation of the quality of reasoning and the Validity and Soundness of an argument. So Modus Ponens applied to 7-9 and Hypothetical Syllogism produce: 10. AAH affects our evaluation of the quality of reasoning, Validity and Soundness. Is 10 correct? To me, 5 contradicts everything above it. 

I see the following: Since 6 has no quantifier, the red x is a FV. Since L7 has a Universal Quantifier, the purple x is a BV. But I still do not comprehend why applying UG to 5 is erroneous. Per p 456 above, the same x is used in 5-7. Lacking any quantifiers, 5 and 6 refer to the same x. To me, the UQ in 7 adds nothing new: the UQ states only that the x in 5 and 6 is true for all x. But x is the only variable in this argument. So for all of what else can 5-6 be true?

What does the allegory of various shades of pink mean? I also do not understand why in 2, these glasses is expressed as a Plural (in Number) Noun Phrase. According to Kant, (each person's) experience necessitates, and so is tinted by, the mind that metaphorised as the rose-tinted spectacles. So should not each person should be tinted by only ONE pair of rose-tinted sunglasses, and not the Plural Number as 2 implies?
