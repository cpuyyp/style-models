This isn't a matter for the future. It is present currently. As race, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, etc have all passed away as socially acceptable sources of prejudice, they have already been replaced. AGE is now the most widely accepted criteria by which it is seen as socially acceptable to base prejudice on. The support for arguments claiming the validity of prejudice based on age is identical to the arguments claiming to support prior prejudices. Current phenomena which are caused by social treatment of the class are claimed to be inherent traits. Medical and psychological communities support them. When exceptions are encountered, they are dismissed as freaks. When a child or adolescent makes a statement which conflicts with that of an adult, they can be dismissed out of hand. Their freedoms, to make decisions about their own life, schedule their own time, choose what to learn, what to wear, who to associate with, etc, can all be taken away without any consideration to their own thoughts, as it is claimed and widely believed that they are incapable of making such decisions themselves. Note I am not talking about a view that young people are ignorant. But that they are incapable of learning, as a fundamental property of their identity. When a well-informed young person is encountered, the idea is never entertained that it might be possible for all young people to become similarly well-informed. They are written off as a prodigy and 'the exception that proves the rule.' Some of the scientific support for prejudice against the young leads to some amusing (to me) situations. For decades, the neuroplasticity of child and adolescent brains was used to justify tremendous restrictions on their lives and removal of almost every form of control they had over their own lives. It was said with such force that the neuroplasticity of youth made them incapable of learning certain complex ideas, fundamentally incapable of long-term planning or rational action, etc. There's a problem, though. Continuing research has revealed that adults, also, retain a great deal of neuroplasticity. At the time, it was presumed that neuroplasticity went away as the brain 'matured' around age 25. Beyond that point, it was believed the brain was 'done' and finally ready to face adult life. Plasticity does degrade over time, and ceases almost entirely (regardless of age) when novelty and continued learning are cut off, but there is no clear neurological milestone at which you could plant a flag and say "Here, this human being is an adult, prepared for the responsibilities and decision-making that entails." Perhaps we should institute dress codes at places of employment, push the acceptable age of marriage back to 50, and rigorously restrict everything modern 'adults' see, hear, read, etc? Society took the idea 'the brains of the young are still developing' and somehow used this to support restricting the youngs exposure to new experiences. This is probably the most aggressively destructive thing one could do to a human brain. The visual cortex is most actively developing at birth, and if you conclude that this means it is "not ready" for experiencing the world, and you shut off visual stimuli to 'protect' the developing brain, you will soon discover that the brain does not develop. And also, if binocular vision is not attained by an early age (I believe 2 months), it can never be attained. Brain development is exactly the changes to the brain that occur exclusively as the result of novel and intense experiences. One can not remove the experiences and retain any form of development. And the brain has 'critical periods' during which certain capabilities must be acquired, or else it becomes incapable of ever acquiring them. When a child is born deaf, we do not look at their developing auditory cortex and conclude that a cochlear implant would be dangerous. We know that it is necessary for such an implant to be installed before age 2 or else the person may never in their life be capable of normal hearing with the implant. We presume, for social convenience and for no well-supported reason, that this type of situation is not repeated in other areas of brain development, such as learning how to deal with complex human relationships, handling one's own emotions, forming one's own beliefs about morality, etc. The prejudice against the young (prejudices also exist for other age groups, including the elderly, but our society is currently most aggressively discriminating against the young) is a good source of learning, I think. By looking at it, and how you might see it yourself, I believe you can much better understand the prejudices of the past. Personally, I am 37 years old and grew up while most other prejudices were in a position where they were argued about. That is an inaccurate picture of what real prejudice looks like. Real prejudice, which is accepted by a society, is something which the majority believe not to be ill-spirited or even worth discussing. It is simply 'how the world is' and there is little sense in questioning it. That is the situation we currently find ourselves in with the prejudice based on age. Age is understood to be a controlling factor over a person second only to gravity, and one which wipes away any need to engage with a persons situation on an individual basis, because there is no point in even trying to assist in their development as a human being. 

I think your initial presumption should be clarified a bit. Human sexuality is not naturally private, nocturnal, or selective. Those attributes of sexuality are socially constructed and did not exist for the majority of human evolution. Privacy in any respect was really only created during the Industrial Revolution. Prior to that, families slept, and screwed, in common rooms. Only the tiny upper class had private bedrooms. Agriculture brought about selectivity and provided motivation for monogamy that didn't exist in nomadic tribes. All pre-historic tribes which have survived to modern times share one idea - shared fatherhood. They believed that multiple men contributed to the formation of children. Most believed that women required a constant supply of semen in order for their child to develop properly. Children were thus raised by the tribe in common, and it was not resource-expensive for someone to care for children which were not their own. Once we settled down into agricultural societies, resource scarcity became much more common, famines killed off many with regularity (about every 5 years there would be a massive famine due to soil nutrient depletion), and it became extremely expensive for someone to raise a child which was not their own. This motivated men to control the sexuality of women and created the situation we've preserved to modern times of women bargaining sexual liberty for material security. Sex was radically important to human survival. Prior to the development of language and reasoning, human survival (as a species) was pretty dicey. Compared to other animals, we are weak, slow, have no venom or fangs or natural armor, etc. We have great endurance and this allowed us to chase game to exhaustion, but that's not terribly useful for individuals. Humanity survived because of strong group cohesion. And people stuck together because of sex. Sex bonded them together and provided motivation for everyone in the tribe to stick with the tribe, to protect the tribe, and to share that game they hunted down with the tribe. This extreme necessity to be accepted by the tribe both for survival and to maintain access to sex partners led to brain development. Dealing with social situations can be very complex (especially without language) and those with the brainpower to manage it had a distinct survival advantage. You lump all chimpanzees together in your question, and this is wrong. Bonobo chimpanzees, for instance, use sex primarily as a means of social bonding and for conflict resolution. They have mostly hidden estrus, and estrus has no influence on how actively they seek sexual interaction with others. Bonobos are our closest genetic relatives, and the primates most similar to humans in terms of sexual morphology (things like genital size, ejaculate density, sperm competition, limited sexual dimorphism, etc). If the humans were without language, I think they would certainly go extinct were their sexuality to change as you describe. With language and technology, however, the effects would be muted and probably not lethal. Most animals have a sexuality like you describe. Those animals are also much better prepared for survival. They're strong, fast, have fangs or venom, etc. They don't rely as much upon group cohesion to survive and many don't join together in groups at all. Humanity with language, reason, and technology would, I think, be equivalent to those species with that sort of sexuality and other survival traits. Humans would have little to no reason to join together in societies, and unless economic concerns forced them to stay together, they would probably dissolve given enough time. Lack of strong selective pressure for positive sociability traits might lead to the sort of things seen in most animals where sex is for reproduction instead of pleasure, like men taking women by force and abandoning them. I have a bit of a problem with you indicating that a lack of motivation to seek sexual pleasure would result in people being more logical. Rational thinking is inextricably bound up with emotion. In the book 'Neurological Origins of Individuality', the author describes a man who, due to an accident, loses the capacity to experience emotion. An unexpected side effect is that he becomes incapable of making decisions. At all. He could list the 'pros' and 'cons' of two choices, and no matter how lopsided the lists were, he was not capable of performing the act of actually making the choice. Emotion is necessary to carry out even the most logical thinking. To presume that sex (and the complex emotional relationships that come along with it) detracts from peoples ability to reason is inaccurate. Also, one thing which you didn't address but I was sort of just assuming... I assume that along with these other changes, people would also be "freed" from the negative consequences of abstinence? Sex is on the same level of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as breathing, sweating, sleeping, eating, etc for a reason. Abstinence is not healthy. It increases risk of heart disease, several types of cancer, death (a study of a town in Ireland over decades showed men with lower sexual activity had an increased risk of death from any cause), depression, anxiety, it reduces the effectiveness of the immune system and even sense of smell. If the physiological changes which alter their sexuality don't change that aspect, you might want to consider a significant increase in mortality due to heart disease, cancer, suicide, etc. Some sources if the topic interests you: 'Sex At Dawn', 'Sex At Dusk', 'Good Sex Illustrated', 'Sex And God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality', the 'Sociology of Sex' course from The Teaching Company (if you can find it), 'History of Sexuality' by Michel Foucalt 

How would you feel if you lived next door to this being with superpowers and you spent years watching your beloved mother twisted with the pain of cancer, your begging for the being to help her always falling on deaf ears? How would the people of the beings community feel when a school shooting or other tragedy destroys the lives of many children in the community while knowing the being had the foresight to know it was coming, and yet the being did not even give a warning? How would religious groups react to the being lounging around while it represents a tremendous blasphemy and undermines everything they believe? Keep in mind that many (if not most) of the wars of history were fought on religious grounds. Philosophically, there are already a great many people who do not believe in a god because the concept of a god who allows the starvation, mutilation, rape, and death of children along with the ravages of war and calamity of natural disasters is a repugnant concept to them, or at least one which they can not integrate with the idea of such a god being benevolent. What would their thinking be if instead of this being a concept in the abstract, it stood in front of them in flesh and blood? Any argument that the entity is not responsible for its inaction, and is not bound by moral duty to prevent the suffering which would take essentially no effort on its part to prevent would, I imagine, be rejected by society. If such a powerful being is not bound by some moral code to exert even the most minimal of effort to help those around them... what duty binds man? The existence of a friendly, but inactive, supernatural being would present a tremendous philosophical crisis to essentially every single system of belief which exists. The religious would hear their tales of the power of their god met with 'Yeah, there's a being three houses down that can do that too.' Humanists would see the being as supremely immoral as the cessation of suffering is the primary tenet of their beliefs. None of these things would be helped should the being use its powers to help, either. Any degree of falling short of delivering everyone into a world free of suffering would be seen as a malicious act (though it may take awhile for that to come about). And delivering everyone into such a world would rob people of their essential humanity, as such is bound inextricably to their biological nature (though few are aware of it). 

That's easy. A culture which does not value the advantages that an Industrial Revolution would bring more than it dislikes the disadvantages/costs of an Industrial Revolution. Consider how the Industrial Revolution (IR) played out in western civilization. Pay diverged widely from the actual value of the work being done because society saw people using machines as 'not doing real work' and not being as deserving of compensation in scale with the value they created through their use of machines. This had tremendous consequences that are still affecting us to this day. For instance, factory owners refused to pay adolescent workers a wage which would make them able to raise a family. This was new. This was catastrophic. The lower class was put into a position such that if their adolescent children had a baby (which was how it worked for tens of thousands of years), people would literally starve to death, either the baby or someone else in the family. This invented, for the first time ever, a practical need for families to treat adolescents as second-class people and to try to suppress their sexuality (since they had no widely available effective birth control). That required a monumental amount of change in society. Sexuality wasn't just something you could start telling adolescents to ignore. They grew up with their life suffused with sexuality from the day they were born. Only the high upper class had separate bedrooms, everyone else slept, and screwed, in common rooms. Since there was no danger of children procreating, and no significant near-universal danger of adolescents procreating leading to starvation or privation, sex was seen as just a bodily function, and not something one hid from family or friends. So not only did adolescents need controlled, but children, for the first time ever, had to be separated from sex. So, as a matter of self-preservation, most all of society set about trying to destroy sex. Home architecture changed, with bedrooms separating children and adults being introduced. The church, with the help of the opportunistic medical profession, started teaching about the moral and physical lethality of masturbation. The only thing in the Bible that could be loosely interpreted as having something to do with masturbation was the story of Onan, and that was always taught as "see what happens if you disobey an order from God", but it was re-framed as "see what happens if you spill the seed" and then generalized to cover all forms of masturbation for everybody. Then the doctors piled on and assured everyone it would make you go blind, grow hair on your palms, turn you insane, then kill you. Families started trading children because they feared they would not be able to beat their own children savagely enough to control them ('save' them). Art had to be censored or, mostly, destroyed, with the Victorians famously destroying so much historical artwork that to this day people think prudery pre-dated the IR (Pompeii shows us different, however, preserved where they couldn't get at it - penis-shaped door-knockers, vagina windchimes, pornographic frescoes in the public buildings, sex toy shops in the merchants area, erotic statuary on the street and all). Schooling had to be extended, as many factory owners simply didn't want younger workers, and the machinery made everyone so productive that fewer jobs were needed to meet the same demand, so 'high school' came about, along with the very beginning of treating adolescents like large children. And that's just a small part of how it affected sex! (I used that because it's the area I'm most knowledgeable about) Society also changed massively by switching from expecting every product to be a unique thing, most often personalized, and available in a large variety, to a much smaller range of items being available in larger numbers and all mostly cookie-cutter identical. A cultural reverence toward artistry and craftsmanship could hold back an IR for a long while. Every social change has costs and disadvantages alongside any benefits it provides. You can only choose to accept or reject both as a package. Obviously, it's not really "choice" and whenever I say "society" did something, I do not mean to imply some grand conspiracy or even widespread conscious action. That's just how the actions of as large and heterogenous a group as 'society' is spoken of (when I talk about these changes, people often misunderstand and think I'm talking about some kind of Illuminati guiding civilization... I'm just talking about cause and effect. Pressures are put on a group of people, individually they work with what they have and try to solve their personal problems, and on the large scale, "a society makes a choice").
