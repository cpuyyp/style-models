Creating the Job Description and passing that to HR Filtering the CVs after HR has filtered them. Conducting an Initial Telephonic interview. Being in the Interview Panel in the Face to Face on site interview. 

I'm a technical Lead in a small organization, and I provide technical inputs to HR in the recruitment process. My involvement in the recruitment process is limited to the following: 

Very often, your current salary can be an irrelevant fact, but it can still serve as a baseline, for the company to make you an offer. I had taken up a government job, which was paying way below market level. I had taken it up, because I was getting burnt out in the corporate sector. When I decided to come back, and start applying, I always answered is as follows: Present Salary: It is X, but the number is irrelevant because of the following reasons: 

I'm an IT professional, who has worked in different positions, in different companies for the last 8 years. Since March, I've transitioned to an Independent Freelancing Consultant Role, where I provide consultancy to several Different organizations. What I mean by this, is that I'm not working at any one place full time. I might work for Company A for 15 hours/Week, Company B for 15 hours/Week & Company C for 10 hours/week. Some of the consulting Gigs are short term, about 2 months. To confirm, I've not founded, nor own any LLC or similar. 

HR has a template for steps 3 & 4 which I fill up and submit. But I'm feeling that this does not meet my needs, in tracking the CVs, specially in the following cases: 

The most common strategy for career switching is to go back to university, gain a degree say in finance, and then start fresh as a graduate programmer. Full-time master degrees should take you just about a year to complete. 

I have no idea of your background, because it all depends on your skill sets and your bargaining power. In academics (e.g. computer scientist at PhD level), visa sponsorship is awfully common. That make sense because the job is really not something that everybody can do. In IT, you will need have very strong background history to convince visa sponsorship. UK, France, Germany and Australia have enough candidates for entry to middle level positions. You will need to prove yourself (more likely a senior position). If you did have the skills set, consider headhunters. Headhunters work with top clients (e.g. investment banking), those companies will more than happy to sponsor you if they believe you are unique. Answer You are free to ask for visa sponorship for any job position that you are qualfiied. However, expect rejection unless you have strong unique skills not available in the local market. 

We can't do this to experienced financial practitioners because they are competitive and highly employable. For your friend - Pay or never step into finance. 

You are really not in business to judge somebody else vacation time. Those UK staffs are entitled to receive their legal benefits. You may also take some sick leaves to compensate yourself for the unfairness. Not feeling happy? You could resign your US position and then move to the UK yourself for better vacation benefits. That will make your new position equal to your former UK based but working in US workmates. 

Realize that resistance is futile, and grin and bear it until you can find another position Resign yourself to playing the political games necessary to succeed within the organization, and don't worry overly about each "win" or "loss". 

It's a reasonable request, at least on the surface. There are many good reasons why your boss may want access to your source code, and few plausible reasons for denying it to him. "I don't want him to make my life more difficult" is not a valid reason. Refusing to show him your code would be tantamount to insubordination. Bottom line, give him what he wants. 

Do the fringe benefits really matter that much if you're not getting paid consistently? If you have the opportunity to look for another position, you should do so. Since your skills seem to be in demand, you can evaluate any prospective employers for cultural fit and similar benefits before burning bridges with your current employer. I would advise against any sort of ultimatum. Either they don't have the money to pay you what you're owed, or they don't think it's absolutely necessary for some reason. In either case, it's unlikely that you'll bring about any long-term, consistent change by making demands. 

Should personal qualities be included information in a resume? No. A resume should detail the applicant's experience, not his/her personal qualities. It may be desirable to highlight certain personality traits in a resume, but that can be done much more effectively by carefully wording the entries related to work experience. For example, let's say you want to transition from team lead to development manager. Which of these better shows leadership? 

The best strategy is to use the money to buy some programming books. Make yourself work 7 days and the boss works 7 days as well. Do it yourself. 

When I interview candidates, I always ask for Github projects. Why? That's because I'd have better insight of what the candidate can do without asking them for a stressful stupid coding test. If your job requires bash script, that doesn't mean you must have an open source project for bash. You just need to build a portfolio of open-source projects you have done. Build something you love, do it good. Try to start a community for your project. 

Your experience is not unusual. Many people have had this experience, it's quite common. If you take note at the Kaggle prize winners, they would spend months just on improving error rate by something 2%. The non-winners could spend even more time on no improvement gain. If your existing model is already good, it's not simple to improve it even further. For example, deep learning might not improve the performance much if the data can be linearly separable. You're not alone. 

Have you thought of replacing the junior programmer with a senior programmer? Please discuss with the finance management if paying a little more is an option. Remove the junior programmer and replace her with a senior candidate. They'll bring more values to your team. 

PhD hurts your job seeking. It's a shame to add it to a non-academic resume, so don't do that. You're not legally required to tell anybody about your PhD degree. Everybody does that. In the industry, nobody cares if you have a PhD title (they care if you have criminal records). It won't show up in background check because nobody cares. 

There are jobs out there with a 4-day work week. I had a friend in a Product Manager role at a previous company who worked four 10-hour days per week. There are even jobs out there with a 3-day work week. Early in my career, I worked at a large insurance company as a server room manager, and my shift was three 12-hour days, 2:00 PM to 2:00 AM. That's not to say that these jobs are easy to find. They do exist, but as others have mentioned, they're uncommon. If a 4-day work week is the most important thing to you, you may need to cast a broader net, e.g. look regionally or nationally instead of in your city. 

This would be a yellow flag for me. Client A hasn't even hired you yet, and they are already looking at this as a one-sided deal. They are looking out for their own interests and explicitly disregarding your own. Think about what this implies about your work life at Client A after you have actually taken the job. I would thank Client A for their interest, express your own mutual interest, and tell them that you intend to honor your commitment by attending the second interview before making a decision. This does several things for you: 1) It increases your apparent value to the first company 2) It shows that you are a person with integrity who honors his commitments 3) It lets them know that you are not a pushover, and that they are entering into a two-sided relationship with you, not a one-sided one Of course, there is a risk that they will withdraw their offer, but if your future prospects for employment are otherwise good I would advise taking the risk.
