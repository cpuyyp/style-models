I think you are taking too much into your own hands. You are working there, and you require adequately clean facilities for your comfort, and the company is failing to provide them. Go to your manager and complain. "The bathroom is consistently dirty, daily." If they don't address the issue in a way that resolves the problem - regardless of the cause - then go to HR. "the bathroom is consistently dirty, daily." They are responsible for providing clean facilities. It's not your job to investigate, provide evidence, or find the root cause. If they choose to do that, that's fine. If they choose to get a cleaning service (or an employee) to check and clean the toilets more frequently, that's fine. If they don't resolve the problem, then you may be able to file complaints with your local governments about conditions of employment, but unless body fluids and other excrement are placed in areas you are expected to come into direct contact with (ie, outside the bowl), then it's unlikely that you will receive any relief. You may need to find another job, or put up with unpleasant scents and sights wif they pose no actual harm to your body. Perhaps a bathroom scent dispenser may resolve some of your concerns. Regardless, I'd strongly suggest you drop all concern over who is making the mess, and only concern yourself with how the mess is affecting you, and conveying that concern to the people who are in a position to resolve it. If you bring up the individual, or the sex of the individual, they may view it as a problem between two employees, or a personal bias on your part against men. This is not what you want them to focus on - at least not if you want them to take action on the messiness left behind. 

"I have enjoyed working with you as well! I'm sorry you are having budget problems, have you considered scaling back the software requirements? It may be that by reducing the project scope or stretching the time frame, we can avoid going over budget by allocating only 20 hours a month of my time." This is a business relationship, and negotiation is expected, particularly at the beginning of a new project. Further, keep in mind that they expect you to haggle, and many consultants are comfortable with slightly reduced rates for longer term projects. However, a 50% cut is unacceptable in most cases. This, however, is just the beginning of negotiations. For a 3 month project you might counter offer: "I really enjoyed working with you on the last project, and hope to continue to do so. I'm sorry to hear of your budget difficulties, but I'm happy to consider a reduction in my hourly rate given longer term contracts. I'd be willing to accept $18/hour if the contract guarantees 40 hours a month for 3 months (120 total hours). If further reductions are needed we may want to meet to discuss cutting back project requirements and reducing my hours so the project fits in your budget." Make sure you have a contract, and that the contract has a penalty if they cancel early - if they do not buy all 120 hours the rate for the hours worked goes up to $20/hour, or write the contract so the discount is applied in the last payment after 120 total hours. Be firm, stand your ground, but always give them paths that allow you to work together. If they want to change the hourly rate, consider asking them instead to change the project requirements, hours worked per month, or some other aspect of the project. This leaves the door open to continued negotiation. Sometimes saying "no" outright will turn a client away who would prefer to work with you but is just trying to get a discount. Giving them no discount but providing other paths to meet their needs will often keep them around. 

If he presses you could mention your desire to visit family occasionally, which involves travel - in other words you want to mention specifically the things that cost more because you've moved due to the job - but this is not necessary or useful, and you shouldn't bring him into your personal finances, but it may redirect him if he continues to press for specifics. Perhaps he'll refuse. Go back a few months later and attempt to renegotiate again. Each time, even if you don't get the raise, you'll get experience. Furthermore, chances are good he will eventually relent the more you ask, as long as you're not obnoxious about it. The one downside is that if you ask too often, he may not give you a great recommendation, or it may be something he specifically mentions to future employers if they call him. Not the worst attribute in the world, but it would be a negative thing to have said about you. 

Then during the discussion find out if he has any issues with the requirements. If he does, then you do the task or re-work the requirements to fit his capabilities. Take the hard work away from him and handle it yourself - there should be a clear delineation between your work and his. When he fails, don't try to "fix" him - figure out why he didn't meet your expectations, and design a requirement that will help communicate your expectations to him for the next similar task. At this point I hope you understand that your current path of trying to get him to change to fit your needs isn't going to work. You need to understand his capabilities, and then only assign him the work that he is capable of. If you get to a point where he no longer meets your needs, then you'd better dismiss him - if the business relationship between his benefits and his output no longer makes sense to you, then sever it and find someone else to fulfill his role. Not necessarily in that order. At this point I'd usually make some conciliatory noises about how people should be able to change and constantly upgrade their skills, but right now you just need to focus on understanding your own requirements, and then communicate them to him clearly. Once you've figured out communication then you can move on to helping him improve his skills so that he can write an ORM query that runs in good time. Until then, communicate, communicate, communicate, and accept that there are some tasks you'll simply have to do yourself. 

Say this at the beginning of the presentation: "I'll provide an overview of the subject, present the subject, and will leave plenty of time for questions after the main presentation." Keep these handy for use during the presentation: "Excellent question, that will be addressed a few slides from here." "Remind me to bring that back up during the question and answer period at the end." "That's a great way to describe the problem that I'm attempting to solve." "That's an interesting question which this solution doesn't attempt to solve, but I have some thoughts on it and would like to be involved in further discussions about it later." "I can answer that, but it's tangential to this presentation. Maybe at the end of the question and answer period, or after the meeting." "I hadn't considered that. Let's discuss it further during the question and answer period." "I appreciate the suggestion." Question you should address during the presentation include those that you already explained - it shows that either you didn't explain something clearly enough, or they weren't paying attention. Quickly answer the question, otherwise they may be left further behind and misunderstand the rest of the presentation. 

I find it helpful to think of my relationship with my employer as a business relationship. I am providing a service and receiving benefits. They are providing benefits and receiving a service. If, at any point, I believe the relationship is unbalanced I can either seek to adjust the relationship, or find a new position with a better fitting relationship. This means that I'm responsible for deciding what path to take. If I like my current employer, and they decide to force me into a set schedule, I'll let them know that there needs to be something provided on their side of the relationship to make up for it. If I can't accept the new requirements, I let them know that it's unacceptable. It's then up to them to decide if the business relationship is worth forcing the issue, or adjusting their business to match my requirements. If we can't resolve the conflict, we end the relationship. It's not because either party is bad, it's just that things have changed on one side or the other enough that we are no longer a good fit for each other. In your case, management has changed, and they're giving you a new schedule. They've provided reasons - whether those reasons are valid or not doesn't matter from your perspective. You've so far been able to keep working with them because they provided flexibility, but now they've taken that away and haven't replaced it with something else that would make keeping this relationship alive worth it for you. You can negotiate with them, and/or look for an employer that will fit your needs better. 

When in doubt, it ok to wait and try to figure out if it really is a problem or not. For me, I determine if it's a problem for me or the business. The only clues you give regarding how it affects you are the following: 

You are explicitly asking for an ultimatum. In general those aren't a good idea because holding someone hostage will generally decrease their trust in you, so that should, if ever, only be used as an absolute last resort for a job you really, really want to stay at. Instead you should hold them to their promises, and do so in a polite, but firm manner: 

Start sending emails twice a week, include the interns, the senior programmer, and the manager. The manager is on holiday, of course, but these will provide 1) a log of what you've accomplished and when and 2) will show the senior programmer that you intend to report on your work, which may cause him to reconsider his actions. 

I'm going to re-iterate what others here have said, but with an analogy that might make this more clear for you, and two alternative solutions. Direct production vs management If you are selling widgets that you make yourself, your income is directly tied to your ability to quickly produce quality widgets. If you've upgraded your tools and skills and are at the peak of your ability, you may be able to get a comfortable living selling X widgets per month. Now you have a choice - you can either farm out the widget production to other workers, or you can keep doing it yourself. If you keep doing it yourself, your income is set. You may be able to command a slightly higher price over time based on improvements in the product and your own expertise, but you are essentially limited by your production. Unfortunately you inevitably have competitors, so even with improvements over time you might have reached a plateau. If you, as the expert, are willing to take on workers to do the more mundane parts of the production while you handle the production that requires more expertise, you can pay them less than you pay yourself, and produce more widgets per month. In the same way, you are selling your hours of time. Unless you can improve your value of each hour you sell, you are unlikely to get more for your time than you already are. You can job hop and get a raise each time, but ultimately you'll reach a limit where you are getting paid the maximum value per hour. If you accept that your time and effort might be amplified with the use of workers producing under your supervision, while you handle the more difficult aspects of the work, you may be worth more to the company. Until then, though, you are only going to get paid for what you produce. Entrepreneurship What you might notice, however, is that the company itself is using you to amplify their product. You are getting paid X per hour, but because of your work they are making Y for each hour you put in. Depending on the industry this isn't always a direct or clear connection, but what should be clear is that your work is worth more than you are getting. They are able to use it and sell it in a way that brings profit, a fraction of which you are getting. Many people run into the same management/production problem you've run into, and they've come to the conclusion that if they have to manage anything, they want to reap the benefits as well. Striking out on your own, even if you intend to have no employees, still increases your administrative overhead significantly, but if you are able to sell your product you may be able to increase your income substantially while still spending over half your time in production. Gain expertise in another field Another option that can increase your value substantially without going into management is learning another art or skill on your own. While the skills you have and the skills you gain individually may not yield a higher salary, you'll find that if you find the right employer who needs someone versed in both areas you'll be able to demand a higher salary. It does limit you somewhat in terms of available positions, but you can choose your secondary skill. Check out the market and look at what's needed. A programmer who understands genetics will have a high paying job in the biotech industry. A mechanical engineer with expertise in control systems will be able to work in many manufacturing industries.
