So you want to leave and you think you have a plan: quit, study, find job. That is a terrible plan. It is far better to find the next job before quitting. You have a source of income. Even though it is not using your skills as you want, and it isn't letting you develop the new skills you desire; they are treating you well. So accept the new task, put the effort into doing it well, and see where it goes. At the same time use the 9 months duration to find a new job. Now at the end of the 9 months that is where is gets tricky. You should be well into your job search. How you handle the transition is a completely different set of questions... The other options you mention: 

When they have a choice they will put you either at the lowend of the range, or the middle of the range. They know that if they start you at the top there is zero room for wage growth. 

Typically as a part of the performance review process there is a discussion of goals for the coming year. Theses goals can be metrics (reduce defect rate by 10%), or they can be based on tasks (complete phase II of the big project). One or more is usually labeled personal development. Sometime the personal development helps the employee, sometimes it helps the company, but frequently it helps both. Many times goals are about training. The employee wants the company to send them the a training class, or to pay for a college class. This time make the personal development goal one that will get you moving towards the job switch. Take a class, assist another group to learn part of the job. This is the perfect time to discuss it. You are supposed to be talking about what was good about the past year, and how can you improve. Typically there is a time period of a few days or weeks where the employee is supposed to do a self review, and to wrie their goals. Use this time to plan this transition. 

In many US companies the trend over the last ten years is to move sick, vacation , and part of holiday pay into one pool of hours. Instead of 10 days vacation, 5 sick days, and 10 holidays. They are changing to 18 days of Paid Time off (PTO) and 7 holidays. The cost is the same but the accounting for the employee and company is easier. Some companies reduced the total number of days, but not all did. Most companies did change rollover and use-it-or-lose-it rules when they made the switch. Once the company made the switch employes no longer needed to lie about needing a mental health day. They still require documentation for longer absences to get your coverage under the short-term or long-term disability. Based on the symptoms, this seems like a longer term issue, you might start looking for a new employer. 

Those are great things to do. But if you focus on applying for positions that your already know the software or tool, then the prep time will be reduced. I am not sure anybody can master software in just a few days. So yes make sure you fit the interviews with the rest of your commitments, but always delaying a minimum of 5 days may not work for all customers. 

Apply to the only one open at this time. Apply to the other ones as they open up. As the situation changes you can withdraw your application(s) at any time. Many systems have an easy way to do this, it just takes the click of a button. If any job interests you and you are reasonably qualified for it, then apply for the position. I have applied for multiple positions within the same company on several occasions. You never know which one will get through the interview process faster. You never know how many will be called in for interviews. Generally if they give you a formal offer, they ask that when you accept it you withdraw from all the other positions you have applied for within the company. 

Six Sigma is a program to improve quality of the products an organization makes. It initially focus on manufacturing, but it has been expanded into into services. The goal is to make sure that even the items on the ends of the bell curve, will pass the quality control checks. Since most people don't produce enough items it is impossible for the 3.4 defects per million objects to be applicable. No developer could achieve that goal. At 100 lines of code per day, a developer would only be allowed 3.4 bugs in their career. The other part of six sigma are the tools and methods use to evaluate the current process, find root causes, propose solution, test them, and evaluate the results. The tools are interesting, but the key is realizing that the overall methodology is the scientific method. You don't tweak the process until you have crated a hypothesis and done an experiment. Will it change your job? IT can't be successful unless the correct levels of management encourage it, and nurture it. The power to design the experiment, and test the hypothesis is done by the team. If a team learns that every time they resolve an issue management files their report away, and never follows through; they will stop trying to fix problems. Organizations that have tried to fake six sigma, or TQM, or quality circles by ignoring the results, or by creating teams to work on minor problems end up wasting time and money with no real results. Organizations that nurture the process, reward the participants, encourage participation,end up with a better product. It might be better quality, lower costs, less waste, but it should lead to a better bottom line. 

Corporate credit card are not perfect. You still need to submit paperwork to get the money. Though it doesn't feel like you are using your credit balance to fund company activities. Realize that they can see everything you charge on the card. 

They have verbally told you you have a job, but if it isn't in writing you don't have anything in front of you to evaluate, nor do they have any obligations to meet the verbal statements they have made. If you were asking us if you should put in your two week notice with your current job based on a slightly vague verbal offer, the answer would be no. So on Monday send an email and ask for further details. Don't cancel the rest of your interviews. If they say they will email them or mail them, wait for them. If they insist on an answer on Monday say that you are interested, but that you have some questions. Start asking detailed questions about pay and benefits. Keep in mind that any indication of your interest that they pick up on verbally is also not binding. If they are a good company but inexperienced in making job offers they will eventually provide all the missing information. If they aren't a very good company they never will provide the info. Part of the problem may be that the intermediary is getting in the way, and impacting the timeline and flow of information. 

I usually see the line CS degree or equivalent. Or the line: "Bachelors degree plus 10 years experience, or masters with 5 years experience, or PHD +1 year experience." When it is written this way it means that if there is an automated process to screen applicants or resumes the lack of degree will stop the resume from being moved forward. I have even seen a resume rejected because they wanted a BS, and the person had a BA. The requirements "CS degree or equivalent" means that they will take a large assortment of technical degrees. They can even take a degree if is not technical but related to the subject matter. The less automated the screen the better the chances of them taking a degree in marketing. In a few cases I have seen them write the line: "X years experience developing software, a Bachelors degree can substitute for A years, or an advanced degree can substitute for B years." In this case they can be very flexible. Remember that they might also trying to meet the requirements of a customer. If they are a government contractor, the customer frequently establishes for the contract the specific rate levels. If the applicant can't meet the requirements for the lowest rate category they can't be hired for the position. The category and rate level they fit into determines the maximum salary for that contracted position. 

Why might they not allow you to be promoted to the title without a degree. The rate they can charge customers for your time is based on how well you fit into the stated job requirements. Some government contract specially review the credentials of everybody that bills to the contract tom make sure they are not being over billed. Without the degree their hands are tied. That doesn't mean there aren't options. Ask to sit down with your manger or HR person and read every job description in the company. There are more computer jobs besides programmers. Some are in IT. Pick one or two that have a higher pay scale than your current one. See if the certification requirements are lower. They might only require an official certification or a 2 year degree. These jobs might a be intermediate step while working on your 4 year degree. Ask if there are any supervisory positions. You might be able to manage a handful of people in the IT department or the software development department. Ask if there is a specific technology that the company is desperate for. Promise to become an expert in exchange for a promotion. If they want to move to the cloud, take on the task. If they want to investigate moving an app to Android, offer to go first. 

I have never had a background check for a job look into past salary. I have had a mortgage company ask. Most large US companies have outsourced the references to a third party. They will confirm date of employment only, and will only discuss salary if the purpose of the check is for a loan and the employee or former employee has given permission to disclose that information. If the US government is conducting a background check for a security clearance they may ask about income info, but what they asked for is the AGI for each of the last several years. The company wouldn't know that because that could be from multiple jobs and would include numbers not related to salary. Unless the numbers were way off, and were not obviously a typo I don't see how a discrepancy form 10 years ago makes a difference. If they found a delta, they would ask for you to explain it. 

Here is a shocker: they are asking for help. If procedures that can result in failing audits change multiple times per week, then as an employee I have two options: 

Based on the structure of your employment agreement, the company you work for may already own the code. Some employment documents claim all products related to your work, even if the product is developed off site, and after working hours. If they go the route of claiming ownership, they could decide to restrict your ability to distribute the code elsewhere. Even if they don't claim ownership, they can still decide to rip the code that doesn't meet their needs out of their systems. 

Based on where you are in the hiring process I would tell them right away. I would call them on the phone and follow up with an email so that they know the exact dates you will be unavailable. You might have to talk to your new manager, and the hiring manager, and to HR. Normally I discuss this type of situation during the interview. I will let them know about things that could cause me to be unavailable during the next few months. I don't mention a dentist appointment, but If I had a wedding to attend that would make be unavailable to travel or attend all-day training I would let them know. As to which option they would accept. It is up to them. Some would delay the start date, others would let you work that first week then go on leave. It would depend on what the job was, and what their current staffing was, and how disruptive to training would be if you weren't there the second week. The worst case would be if not being there there the day the specified makes you ineligible for the position. But in that case delaying telling them doesn't help your situation. 

While you see them as your customer, and they are to some extent, they are a customer of the IT department. If you know that they are a professor, then call them by Dr. or Professor unless told otherwise. If they are another employee of the university/department such as a secretary, teaching assistant or graduate assistant: Mr., Mrs., or Miss is more appropraite. Again unless told otherwise. They didn't select you, they came to the IT department for help. 

Even if you loved the pay and benefits the delay between you accepting the offer and starting work is very long. Unless the contract has a penalty on them if they change their mind, I would as the start date approaches keep some level of job search going. The risk you face is that if the week before your start date they say "oops we no longer need you to fill that position", you have no income and no recourse. So having applied to other positions means that you can quickly jump on any interviews. Deciding on the timing on when you change from applying; to accepting phone interviews; to in person interviews - is up to you. If you do happen to get a non-conditional offer that you are ready to sign, then you need to decide if you want to reject the first company. Please read all the documents that you were sent to see if there are any penalties you face by rejecting the first company. 

So depending on where people were before, and where they see themselves going in the future they will have different sources of motivation. None is better than the others. They all have their strengths and all have their weaknesses. Also the phrase "passionate, excited, growth-oriented, etc" is impossible to quantify during the interview process. It can even be faked. You can be passionate about technology, excited by the product and interested in seeing your bank account grow. 

In some cases a few entry level positions are unlisted because they are for interns that have graduated. Of course the intern positions are listed on the company and university websites. Unless the company is very small most have some way to post positions and accept resumes via the web. They may also advertise positions via sites like LinkedIn but these list generally ask you to apply via the website. In many companies they may keep entry level positions advertised all the time. They know student complete their university studies at different times of the year and due to the different lead times needed for the positions it is just easier to constantly collect resumes, and then take the most recent ones as actual positions are needed. 

When sick was a separate bucket they didn't pay those hours, but under the PTO plan there is no way to separate the hours. The policy should also address floating holidays and other similar plans. In all cases once you stopped coming to the office, you were no longer an employee and were free to start work for your new company. Note: in one case employees were given an option regarding the payout of PTO. Lump or two weeks at a time. The difference is that a bigger check has an larger initial chunk taken out for taxes, but you get it all at once. At the end of the tax year it makes no difference which method is used, but it could make a difference to some people in the short term.
