It's tough to give an "objective" answer to this, but I was in the same scenario 5 years ago and went with a CX bike and have no regrets. I always advise newbies to non-mountain biking (e.g. you're new to pavement commuting, road biking, racing, touring, gravel road biking, etc.) to at least consider a CX bike. Here are some thoughts: Road bikes tend to be very specifically tailored to road cycling, with lightweight (i.e. less durable components), and an aggresive (i.e. "hunched over" riding position that while great for racing is not so hot for almost all other pursuits (commuting, touring, etc.). CX bikes, at least at the entry level (think aluminum frame, carbon fork, low to mid-range components) tend to have a more upright position that's a lot easier to get used to if you're coming from mountain/hybrid bikes. They also tend to have more heavy duty components, e.g. wheels with more spokes, etc., and the aluminum frame ones will often include mounting points for racks, fenders, etc., which road bikes tend not to. As such, a CX bike can be a bit of a jack of all trades, letting you try out various types of road riding: 

Ultimately, I've found my CX bike to be a real swiss army knife and it's allowed me to experiment with a lot more different types of riding than I think I could have if I'd gone with a dedicated road bike. In the end you should test ride both bikes, a couple times if the first rides aren't conclusive, and see what you like the feel of better. Also, quick caveat: in the time since I bought my bike, spinoffs of road racing have been proliferating and manufacturers are putting out more and more high end bikes within those niches (e.g. high end all-carbon CX bikes or gravel bikes), and like a dedicated road bike, those will not be as multi-purpose as an entry level CX bike would be. E.g. if you look at a high end CX bike, it will probably be all-carbon, with no fender/rack mounting, so will not offer much in the way of touring capabilities. Hope that helps! 

Consult the repair manual for your fork. It will tell you where to lubricate and how much to apply. Without knowing what fork you have, we can others only speculate. Check the manual or post the model and we can look at it. 

Your sliding out at 5mph wasn't because the tires were slicks, it was for some other reason. They were either lousy tires, improperly installed, rider error, or some other factor. If you are riding on the road, there is no need for any kind of tread. Slicks are perfectly fine, despite your thoughts from your previous experience. In fact, they are ideal, and will be easier to handle on the road than tires with tread. A definitely don't get any of those combination tread tires, those are the worst. Forget the treaded tires with kevlar inserts. Get the Armadillos, Continental Gatorskins, or some other sort of flat resistant tire. Make sure they are always pumped up before you ride, and they'll serve you well. 

It looks to me like you are pulling too much cable. It even looks like your brake lever is close to being able to bottom out against your levers. In normal operation, brake levers do not come out nearly as much as you have as in the picture. First thing to check is to make sure your brake pads are not worn out. If they are, replace them. Then re-adjust your brakes so that you have as little clearance as possible without any rim rubbing. If your wheels are so out of true that doing so is very difficult, it would be worth resolving that. Then, check your brake arm tensioning spring. This will help pull on the cable and to keep the cylindrical cable end seated in the slot on the brake lever. See if you can move the spring to a higher tension setting. Your frames brake post should have three holes in it, you can adjust the tension by removing the brake arm and replacing it with the spring in a different hole, and your brake arm may also have a tension adjustment screw to fine tune it. And just as a sanity check, make sure the cable isn't slipping through the cable binding bolt when you hit the brakes. 

Insulation tape. In multiple colors to suggest a really bad taste, as opposed to single color conspicuously hinting at a bike that's been intentionally uglified. Adding some rusty bits and pieces from the other bike would help. I'd say also remove panniers, or any accessories that scream "quality". There are sticker glue removal solutions in stores. I've been using some cleaning solutions normally used in furniture manufacture for cleaning up marker writings, excess hardened glue and stickers from the final product before shipping. Stickers instead of insulation tape have the downside that, being made of paper, they don't come off in one piece, making them even harder to peel off cleanly. Further adding some really ugly (cheap, cracked) mudguards could contribute to the overall cheap feeling. 

While I'm not sure this qualifies as an answer, because with such questions there is usually a lot of guessing, your issue sounds like a flexing issue or a worn rear-hub. The flexing could happen because of your weight (maybe fatigued frame? or just flexible) resulting in slightly changed geometry while riding vs suspended mount. A worn rear hub could cause a wobbling or light tilting in the cassette while under load. I would also check the cables while the bike is mounted on the stand and see that the clamps or the bike position (handlebars sitting at a hard angle, pulling on cables) are not somehow affecting the tension in the derailleur cable. 

Yes, there are problems. Not only do the mechanisms have to be complex, as you can see in the videos, but they have to be very strong, too. The moving parts of the chainring drive has to withstand the total force the rider is delivering, because the input to the pedals will try to drive the expanding elements inwards. Complicated precision mechanisms, high strength, and low weight is a combination that is rarely found together for reasonable prices. Compare that to a derailleur system. In a derailleur based drivetrain, the derailleur doesn't see any significant loads. All it really has to do is to move the chain from side to side. That's about it. It can be a little tricky when you are shifting under load, but pins and ramps on chainrings and cogs can do the job to ease the load on the derailleur. In the expanding chainrings, that has to bear the brunt of the entire rider's power output. Ever had a brake cable slip through the binding bolt while braking? That was only with hand power. Imagine standing on the brake lever, imagine how much of a hassle it would be to make that connection rigid enough. Furthermore, imagine trying to shift under load when you have to overcome the force you're putting to the pedals. You still need a chain tensioner on the drivetrain too with these systems so there really isn't any benefit apart from novelty. 

I would add to the already existing answers some of the thoughts that come to me as a bike user. For me using a bicycle is a mean to prevent getting out of shape. Using an electrical bike would be like going hiking with a car or elevator. This applies for a lot of my friends riding bikes. Some of my colleagues complimented me on the fact that I exercise daily by riding to work. In the same register, I expect the opposite reaction for riding an electrical bike, as it would point the user out as a lazy/weak person, unwilling/unable to do any effort. Not saying it's true or right to be judged, but people often live by what others think about them (the coolness factor). you may get coolness points in the gadget section, but it's a different group of people that will compliment you on that. So it depends on where you want to position yourself. A cheap bicycle is something you can easily toss in some corner when reaching a destination (edit: and of course diligently chain it up), without too much worry regarding theft. Can't do the same (with peace of mind) with an electrical bike. Depending on where you live, using a cheap (second-hand, maybe) bicycle for two to three months already pays for the bike itself, by saving on transport costs. With an electrical bike, there is a steep initial investment, and the ROI is spread over a much longer term. Electrical bikes are heavy and not so easy to maneuver in tight spaces where you need to carry them (like stairs). If they are light usually they are very expensive. Finally there is the same concern as for electrical cars: will the charge last for the whole trip? If not, you'll have to pedal-drive a lot of additional mass accounting for the motor and battery. 

Bicycles are inherently stable because of their geometry. The geometry causes the bicycle to always turn into the direction it begins to lean, which keeps it upright. The reason is best illustrated through a concept known as counter-steering. Counter steering is how all two wheel vehicles turn. When you want to turn towards the left, you turn the handlebars a little to the right. The friction of the wheels pulls the bottom of the bike towards the right, which initiates a lean towards the left. The handle bars then begin to swing towards the left to track through the turn. When it's time to stop the turn, you turn the handlebars a little more to the left. That pulls the bottom of the bike further towards the left, which brings the bottom of the bike directly under the center of gravity and thus stopping the turn. On many bikes and at low speeds, the counter steering effect can be unnoticed by many riders. However, at high speeds, or with heavier vehicles such as motor cycles it is more significant. So, how does this work where there is no rider? It is because of the rake in the fork and the rail it causes. If you trace an imaginary line through the axis of your fork to the ground, it will hit the ground ahead of where the wheel contacts the ground. Because the wheel contacts the ground behind the steering axis, the wheel will always feel a force from the road trying to bring it to center, pointing straight ahead. When the bike is tipped to one side, the forces begin to push the wheel to the side that the bike is tipped. So all these forces add up. The rake in the fork makes the bike want to go straight forward. And when it feels a bump in one direction or the other, the counter steering will tend to bring the bike the other direction. Then the fork rake will begin pushing the front wheel further away, which will then straighten the bike out, because of the counter steering.
