The depth gauge spins deeper and deeper, past one hundred thousand metres, far beyond the deepest oceanic trench. The Plongeur should have been crushed by the pressure, but somehow it survives. 

Why did this quotation occur to the narrator? In Coleridge’s poem, the sailors have been drifting in the ocean, until “every tongue, through utter drought, / Was withered at the root”. They are surrounded by water and yearning desperately for it, but it is salt and they cannot drink it. So in Peel My Love Like an Onion the narrator is likely also yearning for something that can’t be had, and we can guess that this is the dark man. 

Interpretation Readers and critics interpret the violence in these novels in many ways. I’ll describe five approaches: 

Shakespeare was of couse unaware of the geological history of Ephesus. But he knew that Ephesus was a port in the Roman era, because this is clear in the New Testament. Acts 18:21 says: 

So here Byron makes a contrast between the “youth, and vigour, beauty” of the hero, and the “hoary” “withering” age of—whom? Someone “that recollects young years and loves”, so this would seem to presage the old age of Don Juan, when his seductions will be at an end, and memory is all he has left of his youth. So the reason why “those things … for an instant clip Enjoyment’s wings” is that youth and vigour bring with them a presentiment of age and death; but only for a moment. Byron repeats this contrast between youth and age a couple of stanzas later: 

If this was the story that van Ryberg had in mind in Childhood's End, then it is another of his unsuccessful theories: the Overlords do have something important to hide about their appearance. (The story has elements of anti-Semitism that are typical of Chesterton. In particular, we can guess from his name and profession, and from the nickname ‘Elisha’ that Exmoor gives him, that the informer, money-lender and lawyer, Isaac Green, the villain of the story, is Jewish.) 

TL;DR: (i) Keats’ biographer Sidney Colvin consulted Hardy, not as an expert on Keats, but rather as an expert on Lulworth Cove. (ii) Hardy (wrongly) believed that Keats had written ‘Bright Star’ at Lulworth Cove. Keats and Severn Keats suffered from tuberculosis, and in 1820 his doctors advised him to move abroad to a warmer climate. On 17 September 1820 he embarked from Gravesend on the Maria Crowther, along with his friend Joseph Severn, whose journal and letters are the main historical sources for this part of Keats’ life. The Maria Crowther was beset by adverse winds as it beat down the English Channel, and this meant that the passengers were able to put ashore at various places, including Dungeness (or “Dundee Ness” as Severn spells it), Portsmouth, and Studland. On or about 1 October 1820, the ship was becalmed off the Dorset coast, somewhere between Studland and Portland, and the passengers went ashore. Severn wrote several accounts of this episode. In a letter dated 21 January 1846, printed in the Union magazine for that year: 

Carraway does not much like Buchanan, but on the evidence of this sexually charged description he certainly appreciates Buchanan’s body. So this brief daydream is hinting: at Buchanan’s extra-marital affair; at Carraway’s knowledge of the affair; at Carraway’s feelings of attraction to masculine bodies; and at a general sense of transgression of social boundaries. 

who can doubt that the you of this passage is Hugo himself, sitting in the study in Hauteville House in St Peter Port, looking out over the water to France, and remembering his former home in Paris? 

* OED: “clown, n. 1.a. A countryman, rustic, or peasant.” One has to go somewhat later to find full-throated denunications of the use of coincidence. George Gissing, an important realist novelist and critic, was scathing on the subject: 

‘Pre-Columbian’ refers to the cultures of the Americas before they had significant contact with Europe. So what suggested ‘pre-Columbian’ to the narrator? Maybe the narrator is native American? Or the dark man is? Or the narrator lived somewhere where pre-Columbian earthenware could be seen or found. 

TL;DR: No. It is generally believed that Shakespeare based Macbeth on Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland, Volume 5 (1587). This is not just because Shakespeare's version of the story closely follows Holinshed's, but because Shakespeare consistently uses Holinshed's phrases and repeats his mistakes. For example, Holinshed describes the encounter with the three witches thus: 

The description of the weather is followed by descriptions of its effect on the bodies of the passengers in the train. The combination of heat and perspiring bodies suggests sex to the narrator: 

TL;DR: The opening chapters of Treasure Island make it clear that the "Admiral Benbow" must be within a few miles of Lynmouth in Devon. Stevenson wrote a detailed account of the writing of Treasure Island. Although this does not mention the "Admiral Benbow" or its location, it does include the passage: 

This sense of the word was coined by philogist Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann in Elementa Doctrinae Metricae (‘elements of the doctrine of metres’), 1817. See here for its first appearance in Hermann’s original Latin, and here for the 1830 English translation by John Seager. A couple of sources for my claim that it was coined by Hermann: 

(The “private cars” are privately hired rail passenger cars, and the “Muhlbach Hotel” is a light disguise for the Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky.) ‘Biloxi’ was a gatecrasher at the wedding. He told Tom that he was a childhood friend of Daisy’s: 

TL;DR: What Woolf meant by “man’s sentence” is that its style, typical of early 19th century writing by men, is “too loose, too heavy, too pompous” to properly represent women’s experience. A Room of One’s Own This passage from section 4 of A Room of One’s Own (1929) is only comprehensible in context, and in even so it is notoriously difficult. Here is the context: 

The "Admiral Benbow" is somewhere on the coast of England where the topography consists of small coves backed with cliffs. Chapter 1: 

TL;DR: In context this is sarcasm: for ‘happiness’, read ‘unhappiness’. At the start of Act I of Man and Superman, we learn that in his will, the late Mr Whitefield appointed Roebuck Ramsden and Jack Tanner guardians to his daughter Ann. Tanner does not relish this responsibility: 

He promotes Cassio over Iago without considering the effect on Iago. He marries Desdemona in secret, even though he ought to know that this will offend her powerful father Brabantio. (In the event he is easily able to obtain Brabantio’s consent, so it would have been politic to have done this first.) He dismisses Cassio from his service after the fight with Roderigo and Montano without hearing an explanation. (If he had gone into the business, he would have heard that Roderigo had provoked the quarrel, and might have wondered why.) This is sure to create an enmity with Cassio and his supporters. He is easily fooled by Iago into believing in Desdemona’s infidelity, and doesn’t take independent steps to test this conclusion. 

(My emphasis.) The quote from Hazlitt is certainly loose (consisting of airy generalizations rather than specifics), heavy (didactic, exhortatory) and pompous (self-assured and self-certain). And it is easy to see that these are attributes that make the style unsuitable for rendering experiences characterized by uncertainty or humility. This seems very gender-essentialist to us now. Surely women have just as much right as men to write in a pompous style? But we’re not obliged to take Woolf’s essay as a prescription for men’s and women’s writing in all places at all times, as if she were as didactic and generalizing as Hazlitt. 

Similarly, in The Green Pearl, Visbhume tricks Glyneth into stepping through a door into ‘Tanjecterly’. 

The violence is a dramatically heightened portrayal of real historical conditions, carrying an implicit criticism of them: 

Homer’s Ithaca is χθαμαλός: if this means ‘close in to the mainland’ it best fits Lefkada; if ‘low-lying’, then Corfu. Homer’s Ithaca is πανυπερτάτη εἰν ἁλὶ κεῖται πρὸς ζόφον: if this means ‘furthest west’ it best fits Cephalonia; if ‘furthest north’, then Corfu or Lefkada. Homer’s Ithaca has a steep forested mount Neriton (or Neritum, or Neion), which best fits Cephalonia, the mountain being Mount Ainos. Homer’s Ithaca has no meadows, and is least suitable of the Ionian islands for grazing horses, which best fits Ithaca. The strait between Homer’s Ithaca and Same contains a small rocky island (Asteris) with two harbours (or one harbour with two entrances) where ships may lie. A plausible candidate for Asteris is the modern Arkoudi, which would mean that Homer’s Ithaca and Same are the modern Ithaca and Lefkada. The four islands are visible from a ship sailing from Elis, according to the Hymn to Apollo, which means Corfu cannot be one of them.
