It's all a compromise. I will tell you a little story for illustration. At the top of a mountain not so far from home, there is a beautiful willow tree. I like to take a break under its shadow when I cycle, after going all the way up. It creaks and sways along with the wind. It's a relaxing, quite zen experience. So, there I was, under that tree, just enjoying life while eating a watermelon with a big spoon. Yes, I rode up the mountain with it in the rear bags. I fancied eating it. And then comes a bunch of spandex-clad guys on racebikes. I say hi, then resume eating my watermelon, because it tastes good. I notice some of the lycra fans ogling my bike. It's an old piece of shit, heavy, and it looks tired because it ran more than 15000 km... One guy is looking at the bags on the rear rack like they're aliens from space about to lay eggs inside his head or something. So I open the bags, pull out a brick-thick tome and simply say "yeah, I was going to the library. You guys ever read some Solyenitsin? I recommend it." Then I turn around, point to a spot in the foggy distance down below, and say "I live there." I turn around again, point to another spot in the foggy distance, and say "I signed up on the public library over there. For exercise. Also I like reading." Everyone looks at me like I'm some kind of space alien. Jaws pop. Then someone points their finger in the distance and mentions "you could get from your home to the library via this route, it's flat and fast and..." "Lots of cars, smells like exhaust," I say, "besides, I like the climb here, the view is fantastic, carrying the weight up only means I get to watch the view a bit longer. I like this place. In fact," I pointed down to the other side of the mountain, "I'm early, so I'm gonna go down there in this other valley, then up here." -- End of story -- I put a 34t cassette on the bike. I also changed the lower chainring to 24t using MTB parts. Unfortunately I can't go lower without changing expensive parts, else I would have. I like options. Near where I live, I can ride the highway, or a bit of unforgiving 20% grade, followed by very nice secluded roads with very little traffic which are a joy to ride on a bike. Very low gears widen your options. They make riding lots more fun! Why not use them? 

This type of gearing will be hard for a beginner. Remember, the idea is not to push too hard on the pedals (which isn't good for your legs) but to spin at a good cadence (like 90rpm). Now, your minimum gear is 34/30, and with the usual wheel circumference of a race bike, at a 90rpm cadence you will go at 13.5 km/h. On a slope of 6% this speed will require 170W mechanical power, which is above what a beginner can do over a extended period of time. Therefore, you will spin slower, but harder, and tire quickly: short breath, high heart rate, and burning muscles due to lactic acid. I suggest you borrow a mountain bike with a tiny granny gear (like 24 or 26 chainring, and 32 or 34 teeth rear cog) and attempt the same hills again, as a test. Go as slow as you need. This isn't a race. You're a beginner. Don't over-exert yourself, don't hurt yourself... you know, be cool. It's supposed to be fun, not a chore. Now, after doing this test, you will know if an easier gearing is what you need. 

Road-bike clips/shoes are not designed for traffic light stops or walking. MTB clips/shoes are much better. SPD are the standard but I don't like them. Time Atac (like the Aliums which retail here in europe for about 35â‚¬ a pair) are a lot better, clip-unclip is instinctive and extremely fast. Also last forever. Avoid Crank Bros at all costs. They will break and you will die. 

Either you are very fit, or your MTB rides aren't that steep... Anyway, let's consider a typical weight weenie race bike : chainring 34T / cassette 24T * wheel circumference 2.1m = about 3m per crank revolution On a MTB you'd get a 32-34T middle chainring and, so the same gearing corresponds roughly to : chainring 34T / cassette 23T * wheel circumference 2.0m So, check which number corresponds to the 22-23 teeth cog on your MTB, this should be number 4-5, and go climb the steepest hill you'd ride with your race bike, not using any easier gears than this one. That will give you a good preview on how easy/hard you can expect it to be. 

Besides the helmet, the most important is being noticed by drivers who are typing a text while lighting a cigarette. So that would be a safety fluorescent yellow or orange reflective vest on top of your normal clothes, plus a front and rear light. 

Gasoline or paint thinner works well to remove grease. The last bit of grease can be removed with something more volatile that doesn't leave a lubricating residue, like brake pad degreaser (or better chain degreaser) for example. As Carel says: "Use volatile solvents and products outside! Test the effect on paint first. Don't use with carbon parts and keep away from decals and similar." 

A kid will always step right in front of you from behind that big truck which blocks your view (or behind anything else that blocks your view, bus stop, publicity panel, whatever). If there are buildings, then one of the doors will open and a lady pushing a stroller will come out. If there is a parking exit, then a car will come out. I've even had a car come out of the entry of the underground parking lot right in front of me, completely oblivious of the fact they were crossing a bike lane. Thus your speed and position on the road should take this into account. Too far right and you will see the surprise a bit later, too fast and you won't have time to stop. Someone will step from behind that bus stop and into your path: 

For example, a newbie (1 hour P=100 watts) fat (m=120 kg including bike) : max vertical speed = P/mg = 0.085 m/s = 5 m/min = 300 m/h Let's suppose he has a granny gear of 32T front, 28T rear (a very bad choice for him), wheel circumference 2m, cadence 60 rpm : minimum speed = (60 rpm)/60 * 2m * 32/28 = 2.28 m/s = 8.2 km/h We will not make him stand on the pedals (too tiring) or use a lower cadence (not enough more muscle). So, what maximum slope can this guy climb happily ? 300m every 8.2km = 3.6% Yes I know, this isn't even a hill, for a seasoned cyclist it's pretty flat, but for a fat newbie on a bike with a transmission unsuitable for him, it's the maximum he can do. For a minute or two he can do 2x more, but not longer. Choose your routes appropriately. If he has a better transmission (shorter gears) he can climb more percentage while staying at the same power, this means slower. There is a very useful tool : the GPS' variometer which tells me my climb rate in m/min. When I'm with MTB buddies who are faster climbers that me, I look at the variometer : I know how long I can last at various climbing speeds, so I know when not to follow them and go at my pace. They'll wait for me at the top, but not long, since I won't be out of breath. When I'm with buddies who are slower climbers that me, I also look at the variometer : I know I shouldn't push them past "x" m/min, and follow that rule. It does work well ! 

With friends the subject of cars and traffic is bound to come up in the conversation one way or another, that is the time to say stuff like : 

There is a rubber seal around the piston which makes it air-tight with the inside of the cylinder. Then there are two check valves which only let the air flow in one direction: one to allow outside air in when you pull (but not let is out when you push), and one to let the high pressure air inside your tyre (but not let it out). 

Problem with most flashlights is a circular and symmetrical beam, ie they throw as much light up as down. This is good for MTB as you want to see branches flying into your face. For a bicycle, this is not what you want. You need special optics, which the German normalized (google StVZO bike light). Result is something like this (as an example): 

From the inside of the car, it is difficult to see if a cyclist is coming, especially for someone who sits in the rear of the car, since they don't have a mirror. Also, no-one looks into the mirror. Thus, keep your distances. That way when a door will inevitably open in front of you, you will not crash into it. You will simply ride past without having to swerve into traffic (and under a bus) to dodge the opening door. For example, this bike lane is designed to kill you. You'd have to ride on the dashed line, or smash into a door. 

Same here, a better saddle delays, but does not ultimately prevent the inevitable hole in your pants. I use cheap gym shorts, and change into trousers on arrival. Also, non-sweaty trousers are a plus. 

If you will climb, get a good assortment of granny gears. If you won't this is less important. Note most bikes are geared way too long. Having enough gears to run up to 50 kph isn't very useful unless you race. Having a good assortment of gears suited to your speed, your hills, and your power/weight is much better. Gear hubs resist much better against dirt, corrosion, salt, etc, but are expensive. 

In my case, bright orange vest + bright red LED blinkie on the rear cut down the number of "I didn't see you!" from once a week to once a year. It works! Besides that, check your local regulations for what is allowed or not. Feel free to ignore them (with moderation) if it is safer, for example it is usually much safer to be the last vehicle to cross an intersection instead of being the first with all the cars behind you. Some other very important rules: 

Roughly, your muscles are made up of two types of muscle fibers: fast and slow. Slow muscle fibers are relatively weak, but they have very high endurance. Long rides at moderate effort level will burn fat and develop your slow muscle fibers. Fast fibers are... well, much faster, much stronger, but they have much lower endurance. These are the ones you use when sprinting, or doing reps/lifting weights. They also have more bulk, so they're the ones usually associated with the "muscle look". If you don't work the fast fibers, you'll look like a climber cyclist or a marathon runner (and you'll suck at sprints). If you only work the fast ones, you'll look like a track sprinter with huge thighs. It is good to develop both, aim somewhere in-between. Basically look at pro cyclists, there is not an extra gram of useless body mass on these guys, so pick one you like, check if he's a climber or a sprinter, and train accordingly. A nice way to do this on a bike is to sprint between traffic lights. This is basically HIIT. It's fun, too. Makes you sweat a lot, so do it on the way home! Pull on the handlebars to work your arms too... but if you don't want the "cyclist arms", you gonna have to either lift a bit or do some rough MTB, which is a good workout.
