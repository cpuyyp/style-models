Maybe add a link in your question, for such is not the Dhamma of the Buddha: no effect, when there is a cause. One may, as said, by training the mind skillfully, bear it with more ease, of cause even to big extend. Nevertheless, what has been caused will have it's effect. Here again some illustrations and Suttas (also to do not understand the law of kamma as a straight line, determinated): 

That is why it is good to stay in ones own range. Sakunagghi Sutta: The Hawk. Maintaining one livelihood, physical and mental, within the wrong range is very risky and destructs the certain economies, leads to inbalance and the hawk might catch. It's very compassionated by a certain Deva if pointing out such dangers. (Maybe it is understood good in that unusual way of comparison) [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other low wodily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

Just a "non-scholar" and principle answer. Kapala, used here (Cambodia, spelled 'kpal' in Khmer) as word for head. If one cuts of oneself the a/the master - in regard of the Buddha here, or what ever transports his way - is therefore more worse than to throw away a life by breaking the kapala because another live is secure, a good or better seldom and to meet the Buddha and/or his guidiance(s) very, very seldom. When we remember even the Buddha, not even he break up or had been unloyal to his previous teachers. That is also why the wise say: 

This Sutta and good sorted others, as well as practical advices, Orion may find in the given essey: Into the Stream - A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other gain in the world] 

To understand the message possible better: householder stands here for "knower" and the six doors (senses and consciousnesses) for the "known". It's not possible to gain liberation, as long one is not disenchanted, has no desire for a home. 

Like the person who had put Sister Uppalavannas translation with a lot of sacrifies on the web (obove linked), he had possible made it in a manner of no fruits to aspected from it, althought it might come to frutaions. Possible without keeping Silas, respectless, thinking on amasing for ones own sake or what holding as self/real. Doning for reputations, wealth (physical, mental by knowledge), praise, pleasant feeling... invest his sacrifies for unreal and not to real directed sakes. Not to tend up-wards, most not even tend as it currently is, up simply wasts his als goodness, merits away. Many of modern lay or opposing undertakings and practices, and their ways, unguided, self-over-estmating in wealth and possiblities, simple waste old merits an goodness possible earlier attained. So it is with all that meditation stuff and well-ness-buddhism, all simple certain ego or not-ego trips. Be attentive, pay proper attention and learn to judge more wisely, step by step, with real benefical sacrifies and their targets! [Later Addition (on account of an answer here) to understand quality of Dana better: There are 3 factors: 

In it's essence, they are not different, diṭṭhi, paññā, ñāṇa, all of this has at least to be abonded to know "done is the work, no more further for this world" and actually just names, as well, saññaṃ. Yet one can fight wars on particulat stands on it, of course. Like "our" Acariya Log-ta Warapol (even having his certain narrow-minded stand on this matter) maybe tried to point out is, that wisdom takes a paticular stand (view, diṭṭhi) not for the purpose to gain a certain stand, but to make a next step to get rid of all views, stands, knowledge. Wisdom takes knowledge as a means, knowing that all knowledges are at least not for sure (anicca), do not bring statsfaction and are therefore without sense (anattha), yet, this raft of good stands, like if walking a path, one would be wise to put the feeds on solide places, is nessesary and therfor common (for the wise) called Essencial Path, with it's sammā Elements. See also answer under the question "Is understanding a phenomenon?" Someone only accumulating knowledge, not aware that this is just playing around with at least meaningless saññas (perceptions), wastes his time with that before really practicing and gain certain liberation, is a fool, nevertheless, a kingdom requires not only skilled but also "slaves" to possible exist for a long time, so it would be wrong if saying that those just able to accumulate knowledge of Dhamma are not worthy of gratitude to certain aspects. Look also at MN 29: Maha Saropama Sutta — The Longer Heartwood-simile Discourse The more people learn without having gained any release, without having practiced, the more stands they take and the more they either become slaves of the Dhamma, of their "spiritual wealth" or ungrateful, pride and destroy all their goodness once having gained big wealth. It's like if you have a lot of money. Most by nature will just make a lot of demerits once rich. A person "poor" in diṭṭhis, and knowledge, but "just" generouse, has by far more wisdom as most scholars and buddhist teacher running around, not to speak of those even having firm virtues and real respect for the three Juwels, able of devotion, able to give. Even when you accumulate knowledge, maintain this or that stand, maraṇa (death) is right after one, yet "what have I gained, what have I let go of, till now?" is wise if reflect. 

It's good to avoid people who develop what ever kind of ideas and justifying which require the break of the basic precepts. Such a person, whether layman, monk, high respected... has to be seen as an outsider, a person not relayable in regard of Dhamma and liberation with even great lack of faith and confidence into the Juwels.

The Suttas give direct 6 factors: Dana Sutta: Giving When one has the wrong perception of a worthy recipient, holding something not really worthy for worthy, thinking this or that wordling is a Noble one, having no perception of those following the Noble One, it is to be assumed that the gifts are given out of right view and so have not much value in direction of Nibbana. People think normal not in spheres of free of fetters but on what ever benefits or wordily aims. Having the tripple Gems possible still present, many are gifted with that unexcelt field of merits and it is merely "sad" if not used. That is why just a spoon of rice, with the right mindstate to a worthy person excells even the biggest wealth given if this two factors are not perfect. Or just the Veneration torward a Noble is many times higher as doing charity to torward ordinary people day by day, the whole year. See dhp] More on Dana, note that the princip in it counts also for the merits sila, samadhi, can be found with references and discussion here: Dana (Generosity, Charity) "Abhidhamma in daily life " May this sacrify made by me, benefit those able to rejoice with it, lead to highest bliss, path and fruit, and may the Devas inform those who do not have seen or heard yet. Anumodana! A possible extended answer as well as space for questions and discussiin can be found here.

Gotamist, never ever delay! When ever wholesome mind (wfich is actually seldom) arises, act on it. That counts not only for bodily deeds, merits, but also for speech. If not acted, a seldom chance is gone. As the Buddha told: Delay a little and you have lost, something that will maybe never possible to do later. 

Hence: Nibbana "just" nicca: secure: might be possible valid to express, taken that sabbe dhammā anattā incl. Nibbana (for security to be not mistaken as "the Self") So the answer here will again either stay food for not conductive thoughts for the path either, or possible lead even more "just" to practice and see (dang km) for "oneself" (kluan eing km). May all able to, gain the best out of it and reach the stream till highest fruit. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for any commercial purpose or other wordily gains] 

to 1.: yes 2.: "overcome the five hindrances" is prereqisite for samma samadhi. "How does one cultivate momentary concentration", it's a product of the prerequisites, a kammic effect. 3.: attention directed to see the circle of becoming and decay, e.g. includes certain sati 4.+ 5.: attention, the view direction; sati, keeping this and sequence in mind; samadhi the product, effect. If there is the "disturbance" of thinking in between, it will be not "direct perceived" but stays to certain amount a blurred perception. 

No. But for your world, as you perceive it, with all it's and you relatives, this very wandering on can/could find an end. Anamatagga-samyutta — The unimaginable beginnings of samsara 

and really display them in daily life and social conduct as prerequisite? (Just came to mind: My person made a small booklet, with the basic teaching, useful for everyone, as a Dhamma present especially for family and friends, far away from even ideas of my persons way. Its in German, and based on the ZzE/ATI treasures. It would be good if such would be compiled in english and other languages as well, but for now very limited in technical regards. Maybe an inspiration: Der Schlüsselband - "Über Freunde, Großzügigkeit und Tugend" - "The key-book - About friendship, Generosity and virtue", following the links the english teachings can be found) There is a small booklet which shows well how Dhamma is taught and introduced traditional, based on the basics of right view: Under the shade of my parent's love, far, far of the "western" or modern way of useless discussions on self, and emptiness, but effective for this world, the next and even beyound. (Now my person "needs" to go for an alms round, to give other parents and childs the possibility to make merits, to work out their path, little by little as well.) It's by the way, not out of reason, to renounce (mostly for a limited time) and ordain so to benefit the parents which are, out of that reason, encounter by the Dhamma as a "family-issue" in that way. That is why it is said that the ordination of a child is of great benefit for the parents. A very usual practice in SE-Asia. Of course it also gains it's critic if done just as meaningless ritual.

michau, and those interested (in possible release), The training precepts - as ones protection to possible not listen to all kinds of defilements and do wrong in regard of the benefit of liberation - are by their purpose, not open for speculation so that they would serve their purpose and benefit. It may lighten or make certain speculations irrelevant to be clear that one does not have any inherent obligation to "help" or "save", but this it self, the notion, is in fact an "obligation" out of unskillful gained debt, independency. For a certain break of "contract", not fullfilling a certain "promise" for a more skillful purpose, see: [Q&A] Is changing your mind same as lying? Breaking promises For precept of killing and generall, see answer in: Euthanasia and Buddhism [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Actually start, not stop to compare yourself with others! , but only with the wise, if looking for a longer lasting good. It's against the mainstream believe totally not wrong to compare "oneself" to others, Eggman, according to the teachings of the Buddha and the path going beyond comparing individuals. If looking and reading the Suttas one will not find many places where not good or bad samples are used for orientation purposes. Path to liberation is all about learning how and what to judge. Others then in usually wordily regards the objectivity does not focus on material thing to be compared, but virtues, and while ordinary man judges in the frame of gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain. (the 8 worldily Dhammas on which the world turns around), a Dhammika (one following the path, "Buddhist") look for orientation amoung the seven treasures. Which seven? 

Philosophy and mind-entertaining by seeking short cuts, does not help anybody. Just the deeds, take part an enjoy the fruits. There is no practice more destructive as the populat "Uposatha of the Jhains" given by the most, talking about emptiness and anatta and sitting right next to the refrigerator. Even if celerbrating the Uposatha of the cowherds, which is done in many traditional Mahayana-areas or those then in wordily directions by laypeople, it still does not cut of the path.

A question to the answeres assuming, might be usefull to go generally beyond and back to the place of work: What should there be aside of the five aggregates, which represent the first noble Truths? Of what one thing did the Buddha taught to strife for? 

What's the different between different kind of selling, trading with entertainment, making trade, with ceratin objects he/she might be even up to gain. Dhamma, of course, is directed at least to abound trading, starting with means of right lifelihood wheras those directed into the world even take Dhamma as a means of their trade. It's not wrong in it's essence, to call them participator of red light districts.
