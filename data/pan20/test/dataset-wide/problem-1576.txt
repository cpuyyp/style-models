As yet, we have very few windfarms larger than that, so this remain a theoretical exercise. There are plans to build windfarms substantially bigger than that over the next 10 years, so we will find out soon enough. 

the health impact of ionising radiation (IR) is linear, with no lower threshold dose. This is known as the LNT (Linear No Threshold) model. there is a threshold dose below which there is no effect. there is a threshold below which there is a beneficial effect. 

Here are the findings from a study from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC pdf) They used a twin-house setup: two identical houses with different settings for the heating. The findings: 

From: "Indirect health effects of relative humidity in indoor environments." by Arundel et al, 1986: 

No, it should not be convincing to anyone who cares about using data meaningfully and scientifically. Raw ambient temperature data is seldom useful in and of itself. Particularly when: 

No, Saudi Arabia has not announced plans for a women-only city. The Guardian article only says that all the workers in the cities will be women. Not all the residents. And that's based on a misreading of the original press-release, which makes it clear that there will be opportunities for female and male entrepreneurs, female and male employees, and female and male residents. The original press release from MODON, the Saudi Industrial Property Authority, that the news outlets based their articles on, says (my emphasis): 

A number of recent articles (Daily Mail, Fox News, Hindustan Times) describe ice cream cones being sold in India which are labelled as "Hitler" distinctly on their boxes. 

Did George Bush in fact take over a year of presidential leave, and are the number of leave days for the other presidents accurate? 

While it is nearly impossible to carry out an experiment on whether hand sanitiser usage will cause the immune system to misfire/fail, there have indeed been peer-reviewed experiments carried out on the fact that significant reduction in exposure to infections/antigens (a likely result of overuse of hand sanitisers) may result in a hampered immune system, which may lead to autoimmune diseases. This is known as the hygiene hypothesis. Epidemiological data suggests that immigrants to relatively "clean" countries, such as Australia and the UK suffer from additional risk of autoimmune diseases. It has been suggested that living in a "clean" country increases the risk of developing autoimmune diseases, presumably due to the reduced exposure to microbes. 

The Wikipedia citations cannot easily be checked (since they are all in hard copy books). However, I managed to access one of the citations (Tesla: Man Out of Time) via its Google Books preview. It also makes a far weaker version of the claim, since it also quotes Edison's supporters denying that he had made that statement, instead saying that the payment was in exchange for purchasing one of Tesla's patents. The citation given (Citation 10) was inaccessible through the Google Books preview. 

"Peak Wind" is a myth: there is nothing similar in wind to how hydrocarbon stocks will get to such a depletion point that annual production will decline inexorably thereafter. The modelling methodology smackdown - Have previous estimates over-estimated the global onshore wind resource? This is currently unanswerable. There are two conflicting modelling methods - the aggregated micro-scale; and the meso-scale. The meso-scale modelling in this new Adams & Keith paper (and in the other related papers by Lee & Keith, and the Lee & Kleidon paper in Davephd's answer) cannot yet be validated, because there is insufficient information about the performance of wind farms greater than 100km2 in area - we haven't built them yet. Until we have real-world data on very large wind farms, we cannot say which modelling method is more accurate. Does it matter? No, it doesn't. There is a wide range of different estimates of global onshore wind resource, that are derived using different modelling methods. They all agree that the global onshore wind resource way exceeds global electricity demand, many times over. And in the absence of validation of meso-scale modelling, it will not get used for wind-farm design, which will continue to use micro-scale modelling. 

Yes, DNA sequencing labs monitor sequences ordered for certain "sequences of concern". At least two gene synthesis companies claim to follow the U.S. governmental Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-stranded DNA Providers, which recommends that providers screen both customers and sequences, and that they ask additional questions if a potentially dangerous DNA sequence is ordered: 

However, this Slate article contradicts the above two articles, and cites an interview with the Golden Rice farm manager Raul Boncodin, who claims that the alleged Philippine farmers were actually city activists in disguise. The article also cites the local Philippine government report (which is a broken link, but is archived on Wayback Machine). 

This is pretty much true, and has happened multiple times in the past. In fact, they were introduced in the German intraday market in 2007. For example, the same situation occurred in May 2014, when prices for energy became negative. 

This image from Facebook claims that "George Bush had America on autopilot for more than a year", followed by a number of presidential vacation days for various American presidents, with the Democrat presidents (Obama: 160, Clinton: 174) having less than half the vacation days as the Republican presidents (Bush: 405, Reagan: 349). 

Each has their advocates. LNT is used as the cautious response to the uncertainties. The epidemiological evidence is complicated by several factors: difficulties in measuring the actual exposure received by very large numbers of people; and other things which affect health that correlate with radiation exposure. So, for example, Cohen 1995 found evidence against LNT: 

Yes, there is a net environmental benefit from photovoltaic panels. It would be possible to contrive a corner case where there was not a net benefit (for example, having a PV system illuminated only by a light bulb, rather than by the sun); but such cases are extremely rare. Let's break down the big, somewhat cloudy question of "net environmental benefit" into some component questions that are commonly raised. Does PV have net energy production? How much greenhouse gases from fossil-fuel production does it displace, when the full product lifecycle is accounted for? How do aggregate damage costs compare? I'll deal with each of those in turn. Net energy production Fthenakis and Alsema (1) looked at the net energy production of photovoltaics, based on 2004 technology (things have improved a lot since then). They found energy payback times of between 1.0 and 2.2 years, depending on the specific panel technology, and where it was manufactured. So all energy generated after that time is net energy production. Systems typically last 15-30 years. The 2009 review of life cycle assessments by Sherwani, Usmani and Varun (3) found energy payback times of 1.5-5.7 years, for systems with lifetimes of 20-30 years. In 2012, Fthenakis (4) looked at historic trends of energy payback times [EPBT], and found that they'd been improving for 40 years (NB the vertical axis has a log scale): 

This survey by Simmons et al. of ~1500 university professors in America shows that religious belief is negatively correlated with the academic standing of the university, and that engineering professors have some of the lowest percentages of religious belief. 

The Daily Mail and Independent have reported on this video, which claims to show an ISIS car bomb being sent flying by an explosion. The original YouTube video can be found here: A screencapture of the video is shown below: 

This article from The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry attempts to replicate Emoto's experiment in a properly scientifically controlled manner (with some small caveats), reaching an obvious non-replication (none of the rice rotted significantly). 

This WND news piece goes even further and claims that Mein Kampf is a standard Arab textbook. Are there any bestseller lists in Muslim countries that show that the book has become a bestseller in Muslim countries in the past 20 years? 

However, the authors have published a rebuttal to the claims made by many anti-homosexual sources based on their work in this paper: 

This means that homeopathy has been shown to be no different from a placebo (i.e. a negative control treatment). This implies that the only effects generated by the homeopathic "treatment" are due to the placebo, and not the "treatment" itself. As mentioned in the comments, from a chemical viewpoint, any dilution above 12C contains such a low dilution that no molecules of the original chemical remain in the supposed "medicine", and therefore there is no scientific basis for homeopathy being a plausible remedy. IMO, the best counter to any homeopath is that tap water is an unimaginably strong homeopathic remedy of literally everything possible, including dinosaurs.
