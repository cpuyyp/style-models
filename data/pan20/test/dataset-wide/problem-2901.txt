Several recent researchers discuss Plato's fallacies or reasoning flaws in his writings (see list of references). Yet what remains mostly unclear is why there are so many logical errors/fallacies/blunders in Plato's writings in the first place. The KEY QUESTION is: Did these many "flaws", e.g. in the Phaedo, escape Plato's attention? If so, the answer is obvious. If not, why he deliberately left them? Did he has a more mystical purpose in mind perhaps? I've found two main answers to this question: 

There's an episode in Plato's writings (I'm not sure) which I can't find and I'd appreciate any help. Socrates (I'm not sure), advances a theory through a fable which is hard to believe. An interlocutor asks skeptically whether anybody would believe such nonsensical claim. The answer from Socrates is something along these lines: "not in this generation, no, but in 2 or 3 generations they will believe it." Would you recall where this conversation is located??? Thanks! 

The argument claiming the complete existence of infinitely many terms is false. This concerns the sequence of elements of {0, 1} in case of von Mises as well as the sequence of all rational numbers (q_n) in case of Cantor. It is obvious that infinitely many terms do not and cannot exist in the finite accessible universe. The analogy to the limit in mathematics is invalid. The analytical limit a of a potentially infinite sequence (a_n) is defined as follows: 

Whether there are ethical problems depends on the premise. If we agree that mankind and its survival has some sense and destination (including unlimited breed, perhaps), then the coin must be left out of the play. Otherwise the coin would also apply when one single human on the one side and the rest of mankind on the other side were concerned. If we agree that mankind is without any destination but simply a meaningless accident, then every individual has only its own feelings including its survival instinct and there is no higher justice or aim. Then the coin may be the right choice. 

Your desire for that deep state of joy exists as a reality for many including some I know and have known. And there are definite ways to achieve it. One of them is being in the present for as long as you can which takes you in a state of acceptance and simply being. But once you practice this you realize it is easier said than done. But this is only one technique which you will find in several selfhelp books. There are many other lesser known methods which I have learnt. Although I have not reached the state you describe, I have certainly felt it for decent durations. I can direct you to learn those. 

I question existence of god or creator based on the irregularities and inequalities and imperfections that I see everywhere in this world. I wonder why god made us all so different, some rich, others poor, some beautiful, others ugly,, some healthy, others diseased. Was he a biased? I am not an athiest, but the god I know of is sacred, unconditional, protects always and never punishes, takes care of me, has all answers, is capable of removing all suffering, is absolutely perfect with no flaws and is capable of making all beings perfect just like him. But he himself says he is not the creator of the universe and that the universe has existed since time immemorial and will exist till infinity. All the above information about the God may appear subjective to the readers, but there nothing subjective about this because I have experienced god and know him for some of the infinite qualities mentioned above. It is not an idea in my head, or something I have heard of or something I believe in or an imagination. It is my everyday experience. The god im talking of lived 2500 years ago, named vardhaman mahavir. He explains the laws of this universe and shows the path to end all sufferings and achieve infinite peace and salvation. After achieving perfection He created the religion called jainism to give people a system that would enable them to challenge their pain and sufferings and get rid of them, and ultimately be totally free of all sufferings and achieve eternal bliss called moksha. 

Robin G. Collingwood's posited the existence of absolute presuppositions (AS). As a reminder, presuppositions are for Collingwood assumptions and guiding precepts that are closed to further analysis or revision (Collingwood 1940). He lists the AS scattered in his writings, so I'm curious to find as many of the the AP as possible. Many of them are in the Essay on Metaphysics. Have you come across others? here's the ones I found: 

One may think that the answer lies in between these two, but can you think of a more realistic philosophical, historical reason? After all, the Dialogues sparked approval and criticism for many centuries. EDIT: Examples of fallacy: Fallacy of equivocation in the Phaedo (Keyt): Socrates uses the dyad dead & not-dead. Then he equates not-dead with immortal (equivocation here), and finally with indestructible. Thanks! REFERENCES: David Sachs A Fallacy in Plato's Republic The Philosophical Review.

The answer to you question and the almost infinite smaller sub questions are very well answered by the karma theory as presented in jain scriptures (religion continued and propagated by lord mahavir, the 24th tirthankar ) . While I can assure there is no reliable source on the Internet that I can refer you to, but having myself studied this in some detail will try and answer this as well as I can. So basically karma is nothing but matter of a different kind. Matter is defined as that which has 4 properties viz color, taste, touch and smell. Now you might think that air has no color or taste or smell, but it in fact does have all these properties which can be tested in a laboratory and proven. Similarly matter of karma has all these properties but it is too fine and science has not yet made enough progress to trace its existence. Like all matter, karma has energy in it, but it bears results only when it comes in touch with a soul, and it can be any soul ie the soul of a human or an animal or any living being including a plant or a microbe. Just the way iron can be used to make a life saving equipment or a life threatening weapon, similarly karma can create both eg it can yeild you a fit body or a diseased one, it can give you the body of a human or that of an animal, it can give you noble thoughts or evil thoughts etc. In short, you can understand that all your life situation including the evil thoughts that come our mind which cause us to act evil are LARGELY due to the karma collected by us in the past. Now the question is how does karma get clinged to us, how do we know it will bear good or bad effects, can we change the bad karma that we have accumulated, how? These are only a few of the many questions that may be in your mind, but I have myself spent weeks understanding this and listening to the discourses and still I feel I am far from perfect. But I have applied this science and have been able to turn my life around so to say and im also teaching and sharing with others and know quite a bit to answer this question. To conclude I can say that all evil and all noble thought and actions are driven by karma. But why is there a need to understand karma? Because few people are evil by choice. Even those who are so evil by choice are going to feel pain, sadness at some point and naturally everyone wants happiness that would last. I would have loved to share the audios but unfortunately they are in another language. Feel free to ask me more if interested and I shall answer to the best of my abilities. 

All well-ordered sets can be compared. They have the same number if they, by preserving their order, can be uniquely mapped or counted onto each other. 

No, there is no true set theory (except for the finite parts). The most important and interesting feature of set theory is the existence of uncountable sets. But this existence is in contradiction with the axioms. It can be proven that all definable elements of sets belong to a countable set. Therefore most elements of uncountable sets are undefinable. On the other hand Zermelo's axiom of extensionality says: "Axiom 1: ... . Or briefly: Every set is determined by its elements. (Axiom of determinatedness)" Since uncountable sets contain undefinable elements, the sets are undefinable too, hence not distinguishable and not existing. But there is an even simpler contradiction of the actual infinity required for set theory. It is based on an argument applied frequently in set theory, already by Cantor in his first application of transfinite induction: 

Why is the accuracy of inner senses low? I would like to keep this answer restricted only to questions and more specifically the right questions. While I would like to give some basic information and some food for thought, answering these questions right away may not be practical and feasible. Before you question the accuracy of inner senses I would like to question the accuracy of outer senses. There are many a times you feel you heard something or saw someone but in reality it was something totally different which you realize only when a bunch of other people validate your perception as false. Why is it that some people have sharper senses than the others? Can they be perfected through practice? Is it that they are simply careless? Is sharpness of senses or the lack of it a result of a choice made by such people? The questions are not limited to senses alone. Given a particular situation or task why did A perform better than B, why does A always succeed, why does B always fail? Coming to the other parts of material world? Why is one stronger than the other? Why is someone born poor and someone rich? The questions eventually lead to why were we created different or were we created at all by another creator in the first place? This leads to risky areas of religion and the like. but I am going to keep religions out of this so that we are not prone to biases. The answer to all above to a very large degree lies in the science of karma. What is karma? Karma is matter, a very fine matter, thousands of times finer than the smallest particles or the finest rays we know. By itself it is inactive, but when it comes in contact of a soul, its manifestations are unlimited. To say in a few lines, all things material and spiritual are caused by karma which can manifest 'good' and 'bad' things in our life. Taking a leap from here, can you imagine a situation free of all karma? We call it moksha or salvation. 

Mathematics does not need axioms. Axioms have been invented only in order to consolidate and formalize the knowledge abstracted from the observation of reality, first in geometry, much later in arithmetic and other branches. But without any axioms every triangle we can draw has angular sum 180¬∞ and 1 + 1 = 2 - whether we note the result as 2 or II or 10 is irrelevant. The describing character of axioms and the fact that axioms have to obey (and not to rule) mathematics becomes obvious from statements like: "And whether, in particular, Zermelo's axiom is true or false is a question which, while more fundamental matters are in doubt, is very likely to remain unanswered." (B. Russell) "Part of our aversion to using the axiom of choice stems from our view that it is probably not 'true'." (Peter G. Doyle, John Horton Conway) Unfortunately meanwhile the pendulum has swung into an utmost insane direction where every axiom has to be tolerated as equally valid unless it contradicts other axioms. 

I am not sure if I understand your questions too correctly due to the language barrier, but my innerself tells me that your real question is that while we take the accuracy of our outer senses for granted,, why is it that we keep questioning our intuitions from the inner world, why is it that the accuracy of the inner world intuitions is so low? To answer a part of your questions I would like to compare the senses of humans to that of a dog. While we can smell food and determine its freshness with a certain level of accuracy we can certainly not sniff out drugs like dogs can. And if we were forced to do so, most of us would either try our luck and some of us who are in touch with the inner world would look within to understand where the drugs could be. Alternatively, while both our intuitive abilities as well as our sense of smell are not well developed, our intelligence certainly is and so we would employ the specific breed of dogs to do the job. My point is that when we seek to employ an outer sense for something it is not very capable to handle eg human sniffing out drugs,, cognitive biases will certainly interfere. But talking about cognitive biases impacting a dogs perception is next to impossible because they are so well developed. The same is the case with our internal world,, we are not used to listening to our innerself so often, plus there is a continuous stream of thoughts which we sometimes or most of the times confuse as our own inner voice plus there are distubances from outside.. in such a scenario cognitive biases are bound to occur.
