Both of these can provide a more upright ride. But fit a longer stem and remove the spacers and you're in the realms of an outright race position again. More importantly, an endurance bike may have more compliant ride characteristics built into the frame. Such as thinner seat stays which flex and absorb the road buzz. Take a look at the Scott Solace or Specialized Roubaix for examples. Raced on the cobbles but endurance road bikes nonetheless. This is just two examples of many endurance race bikes. I should also add an endurance race bike will maintain the close clearance geometry on rear and steeper head-tube angle. Which will keep the bike responsive. Moving away from endurance race - then the bikes may take on more of a touring geometry also - with longer chain stays, slightly slacker head-tube also. They may also allow for bigger tyre clearance, disc brakes and mudguards. If you're looking to go as fast as possible with consideration for comfort - than it is an endurance race bike you should be looking at. 

This is to do with the different pull ratios employed by the different systems. In your case 10 vs 11 speed Shimano. $URL$ If you look at the table in the link - it says the 10 speed levers pull less than the 11 speed levers but the rear derailleur ratios are also vastly different. 

Because you are buying new brakes - the best thing to do would be to store your old brakes in the same manner you receive the new brakes. And that would also be re-using the existing packaging. I'm sure the logistics in getting newly manufactured brakes from the production line to the retail counter / customer involves many months of transportation and storage. So you should be absolutely fine mimicking this. 

Rotor size is determined by the brake mount adapter. So everything else ie. the caliper - stays the same. Only the Adapter changes. You must check your fork manufacturer for the maximum size of rotor the fork can be safely operated with. Also check frame clearances (at the rear) for enough clearance for the size of rotor you are selecting. Going up rotor sizes is specifically for more braking power. 

If cranks, saddle and bars are in the exact same relative positions on both bikes and all other factors remain the same - then there will be in theory - no discernible difference at all. Bicycles labelled as endurance road bikes are not necessarily any slower than a full-on race bike. And the lines become blurred when you consider endurance race bikes. In general (very general), an endurance bike will have tweaks to the geometry & design features leaning towards comfort. 

I've used Elite and Tacx trainers. The Elite had an elastomer roller and the Tacx a metal one. The elastomer one is quiet and I do experience slippage on the metal one. However, they apply pressure to the roller differently. The Elite uses suspended weight of rider and bike - whilst the Tacx uses an adjustable mount rising up to the rear tire. On my Tacx, the small amount of slippage is only for a short period as the tire & me warms up - maybe a few minutes. On the elastomer roller - no slippage, less heat build up too. I could adjust the slippage out - by applying more pressure to the rear - but it is such a VERY small amount - which happens only on out of saddle efforts (calibrating the smart turbo) and is gone after a minute. Still using the same tyre on both. And have used the tyre for a good few years now. 

Yes. Barrel adjusters are reusable. More useful for the front mech which doesn't have any on-the-fly adjustment. And useful for the rear mech for quick adjustment without having to get out of the saddle. 

Cycling in a big gear is a very common training session for cyclists. Big gear & low cadence seated hill climbs are sessions I have done in the past. The idea is to build muscle and consequently strength. This on its own is not ideal - since one must also have the ability to spin a bigger gear. So other sessions are designed to improve pedal action & leg speed. Bring leg speed together with more strength and you simply get faster. Not so sure about the point about additional strain on the knees - since in theory by pushing a bigger gear in lower cadence doesn't mean you are going to be going any faster than if you are pushing in a smaller gear in faster cadence. And this means the power you can make is the same regardless of gear - for the same power output. 

Whenever I have had a problem with a regular clicking noise coming from the chain - it has been either a stiff link (which goes as the chain loosens up through use) or a split pin on the chain ie. the pin has detached from one side of the chain. It can be hard to spot but worth examining for. 

If you're climbing a lot than the other consideration is weight of tyre and tube. The 28mm tyres take a larger inner-tube and the tyres are heavier than their 25mm equivalent. Benefit you would gain from 28mm - would be grip and comfort due to a wider contact patch and larger volume. 

In my experience, skipping in certain gears at the rear is the first sign. Usually in the most used sprocket. Then the chain becomes worn - and perhaps starts to snap - and when you order a replacement - it skips all over the place because it is being run on an overly worn drive-train. You might be able to salvage the old chain and run it for a bit longer - but sooner or later - you have to bite-the-bullet and buy complete new drive-train. But if your current drive-train is happy and not exhibiting any malfunction (keep that chain clean and oiled) - you could go for many many many miles on it. 

As said - should not be rotating. A simple check - Pull the front brake only to lock the front wheel and hold. Now rock the bike back and forth. If there is a "click" pushing the bike forward / backward - it is likely the headset is lose. You say the headset allen key nut is tight and compressing the headset? But how tall is the steerer tube - or put another way - how close is the top of the steerer tube to the top of the stem. If it is very near level - you are missing a spacer - and now matter how tight the nut is - it will not provide enough compression / tightness of the headset. 

Historically STX-RC was higher in the series than Acera. If they are from the same year - than STX-RC would be the "better performing". If they are from different years - than Shimano have a habit of trickling down technology from one series to another over subsequent years - so harder to say. 

Muc-Off or any other bike specific cleaning product is a good bet. Followed by a brush and hose down. It's not necessary to go all out with a pressure hose. I also use a chain degreaser spray and use this sparingly on the cassette with a brush. It bring the chain up like new. However, immediately after cleaning the drive-train - I re-oil the chain and wipe the chain down of any excess. Chrome steel nuts and bolts will pit and corrode. Try applying a light film of grease over them. 

Not sure why you would attempt to use a threaded headset as a threadless headset - other than trying to save on something which you can't. The stem and top-cap assembly of a threadless headset are integral to securing the fork into the frame. Whereas a threaded headset secures the to the fork using a large nut. There is nothing to stop you buying retro one inch fork, threadless headset and stem. That would be the safest way to do it. 

What you are attempting to do is calibrate your heart-rate on the indoor trainer to real-world riding - and this is far too complicated. Since there are so many variables to consider. Heart-rate is an indicator and not as accurate a measure as a power-meter. Your heart-rate can vary for the same effort over the same terrain depending on diet, recovery, fatigue and so on. Also riding outdoors there is the issue of weather conditions also - which can be for you or against you. Another factor I can see is - although your indoor trainer attempts to provide a "road-like feel" - and all indoor trainers boast of providing the most realistic road-like feel. It will have a spin-down - that is the period which the trainer continues to spin after pedaling has stopped. This represents resistive inertia - good ones have excellent resistance and also take longer to spin down and have a nice "feel" to them when riding. So - your indoor trainer will not be a perfect representation of real world riding. And don't forget - perceived effort - for me - indoors is often greater than perceived effort outdoors. I know for fact - my indoor power stats are lower than my outdoor power stats. Personally, I would be setting the resistance at a single-level and changing through the gears to alter resistance. Looking purely at speed as a measure of your power - and using this as a basis for training. Might be a bit tricky - because it is speed and not power (everything is watts these days!). But you can combine this with your heart-rate data to know your speed and HR zones for training. 

I've seen this kind of crack on a few frames - not just alloy. So it is not uncommon. If it were steel it would be easier to repair - I've not heard of anybody who has repaired their alloy frame either - so probably not such an economical repair to have done. How long it will last will depend on a variety of factors - so its difficult to say. I certainly wouldn't go mountain biking on it. Personally - as said before - its probably best to find another frame. 

Assuming you are fitted correctly over the pedals on both bikes - the only other variable to consider is how far you have to reach to the bar. This is measured either as effective top-tube (ETT) or horizontal top-tube (HTT) length. There is another measurement given as reach - this the ETT from the intersect vertically over the bottom bracket. All will give you some idea of fit. Top tube length can be then compensated using a shorter / longer stem and bars with shorter / longer reach. There may also be a slight difference in head tube length. A bigger frame may have a marginally taller head-tube - which in turn translates to a slightly taller rider. Adjustment is available with stem spacers on most new bikes to go higher or lower. A smaller frame is lighter and quicker to manoeuvre - which might explain why Pro-riders lean towards under-sizing their race frames and compensating with long stems. A longer stem may look race-oriented but it can also make the steering feel a little less direct. Also the shorter head-tube can allow Pro-riders to get over the the bars a lot more for an aggressive racing position. In your case were you to under-size you might be able to get a "slammed" race position - if your back can take it - or you may compensate with a stack of spacers which might not look so good aesthetically - especially when they pile-up. Aesthetically, a 100-110mm (or thereabouts) looks fine. And about an inch of spacers provides enough movement for height without looking OTT. Its always good to leave some on imho - in case of injury - where you may need to heighten the bar. 

The best way to simulate hills on an indoor trainer is to set a target speed (power) for a specific interval. The interval needs to reflect the duration of climbing you wish to improve in the real world. During this interval - you need to match your cadence down to a climbing speed cadence. This would help to simulate the same muscle recruitment you would do in a real climb. Attempt the interval in both seated and out of the saddle - as you would a real climb and use the gears to adjust for this accordingly. Better done with a powermeter - but speed on your turbo will equate directly to a power wattage. Some smart turbos now have a power reading in-built and some software offers calibration for various turbos to convert speed into power. The point of increasing resistance to cause a slowing down of cadence is to try and simulate what happens in climbing. Where the legs muscles become engaged in more of the stroke going round as opposed to flat land riding where a high cadence is often employed and the leg muscles are engaged in relatively less of the stroke.
