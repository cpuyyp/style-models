if it is possible to translate an ordinary language statement into mathematics then it must have been precise in the first place. This was the flaw in the idea of translating philosophical statements into symbolic logic and the reason Russell's attempt didn't prove useful. Where it's possible it isn't necessary. One cannot make a statement in English more clear by translating it into French. 

I am somewhat out of depths, it must be said, but I find Russell's solution more like a sticking plaster and prefer the solution given by his colleague George Spencer Brown. Russell himself seemed to like it albeit he didn't seem to quite understand its significance. The reason would be that the paradox arises in metaphysics, where R's solution is no help but GSB's solution works. The theory of types/classes seems like a technical fudge to me, but perhaps this only is because I'm not a mathematician. Pardon me if this is off-topic. 

You are assuming that omniscience is a belief in what is true and asking how we can know whether our belief is justified. But true knowledge is 'knowledge by identity' for which knowledge is identical with its object. Such knowledge (and only such knowledge) has no possibility of error, as Aristotle somewhere notes. Omniscience can only be self-knowledge and this is reflected in the ancient Oracles' advice to knowledge seekers. A complication is that where omniscience is spoken of as a possibility and human potential as in the Perennial tradition, Indian religion, Buddhism, Taoism and so forth, it is also said that at the limit the distinction between knower and known ceases to function such that omniscience would not be knowledge in our usual sense but more like Awareness or Being. As the Upanishads ask, who is there to understand the understander or know the knower? For omniscience the knower has to become the known and the understander has to become the understood. The idea of knowledge as 'justified true belief' would be inadequate for omniscient knowledge. 

The poet Paul Valery gets it right with the line - "Sometimes I think, sometimes I am". The 'I am' of awareness requires no thought yet thought depends on it. Kant saw this and places the origin of the intellect prior to the categories of thought such that it is 'not an instance of a category'. I'm fairly sure he would have been a Buddhist if he'd been alive today. 

It may be important to note that a false memory is still known as a memory. The phrase 'false memory' immediately implies that we know of the memory, albeit that it may be false. We know we are remembering, perceiving etc., regardless of how well or accurately we are doing it. If we didn't know we had a false memory we wouldn't have one. It may also be relevant that one expression of the Perennial epistemology/ontology is to say that 'knowing' is fundamental, which seems to be where Williamson is going. 

In the perennial philosophy the laws of causation (in an ethical context) apply to intentions and motivations, not to deeds. If we help an old lady across the road and she gets run over half way across we are not marked down for this since it has nothing to do with our intentions. A teaching story has it that Buddha committed a murder in a previous life in order to save others from being murdered. The deed seems reprehensible, but the motive is what counts. The punishment and rewards would be self-administered and this would be why we cannot escape our fate, that we will be our own judge and jury. We were there and know exactly our state of mind and intentions at the time. Socrates indicates this view when he says,'The price of a lack of virtue is a disordered soul'. A disordered soul would be its own punishment, just as virtue would be its own reward. Ignorance of the effects of actions would be a valid excuse, but a failure to make any attempt to dispel our ignorance would have no excuse. Feigning ignorance would be impossible and pointless because no outside agency would be judging us. When a rock falls off a cliff it follows the laws of the universe all the way to the bottom, and the laws of karma would be just the same for falling humans. What this would mean is that are no blanket rules. As the OP says, murder, criminal acts etc. are not always wrong since context is everything. Purity of heart would overcome all ethical errors and this would be connected to the teaching that those who are enlightened, thus free from any egoic tendency to think or act to the detriment of others, transcend the legacy of their karmic history. This seems to be in line with the idea mentioned in another reply that it is the state of our consciousness that matters, and that determines the strength of the connection between our deeds and their consequences. 

This seems a good question. It is a source of problems for me that one is not allowed to refer to the thing-in-itself as a phenomenon, entity or thing. A phenomenon depends on a noumenon (that has phenomenal properties) so to call the noumenon a phenomenon is confusing. In Buddhism's Abhidhamma pitaka (basket of teachings), which itemises the components of existence, Nibbana is called a phenomenon but uniquely among phenomena is without a noumenon. This is the approach I use, calling the final phenomenon a phenomenon but noting that it is different from all others. Otherwise a language problem arises and no word will do for the thing-in-itself (For instance, it is called a thing but defined as not a thing). Note that Kant is not expert in this area but speculates. He speaks of multiple things-in-themselves which mightily confuses the issues. The idea that what lies behind phenomena is a large number of things-in-themselves is unworkable since by definition there is no way to tell two things-in-themselves apart. If we say there is just one ultimate phenomenon/noumenon then your question becomes a little more simple to address. Kant supposes that we cannot know the thing-in-itself so must speculate on these issues but this view is not forced on us. For the mystic the thing-in-itself would be the 'I Am' of the Old Testament and this would knowable by identity. But this line of thought would take us OT. You might like to check out the 'problem of attributes' which is immediately relevant. Here is Colin McGinn as a teenager wrestling with it. “…[P]icture me sitting on a bench staring at a British mailbox on a blustery spring day in Blackpool. I had just been reading about the questions of substance and qualities, and was suitably transfixed. Is an object the sum of its qualities or does it have an existence that is some way goes beyond its qualities? The mailbox had a variety of qualities - it was red, cylindrical, metal, etc. - but it seemed to be more than just the collection of these; it was a thing, a “substance,” that had these qualities. But what was this substance that had those qualities? Did it lie behind them in some way, supporting them like the foundation of a house? If so, what was this underlying thing like - what qualities did it have? If it had some qualities, wouldn’t there be the same problem again, since it would also have to be distinct from these qualities? But if it had no qualities, what kind of thing could it be? How could these be something that had no qualities? So maybe we should say that there is nothing more to a mailbox than the qualities it manifests. And yet how can an object be just a set of abstract qualities? Isn’t it more solid and concrete than that? … I had a vague mental image of a grey amorphous something that constituted the underlying mailbox, to which its various manifest qualities mysteriously were attached… Yet as soon as I replaced this fuzzy image with the qualities by themselves, trying to think of the mailbox as just a “bundle of qualities,” the object itself seemed to disappear.” Colin McGinn The Making of a Philosopher Simon and Schuster 

“Perhaps in putting together our picture of the world there are many paths we could have taken. How, though, could we ever tell? We can think of each experiment and its interpretation as a fork in the road. Decision by decision we are pushed into new regions in the space of possibilities. Before long, we have ventured so far in one direction that it is all but impossible to go back. Our search for truth has carried us out along a single branch of the tree of knowledge until we are so far out on a single twig at the end of a certain limb that we are powerless to imagine how it could be otherwise. Perhaps the patterns we discern are neither universal nor arbitrary, but the result of the intersection between our nervous systems and some kind of real world. Borrowing from Kant, we might begin to explain the seeming effectiveness of science and mathematics like this: We have these wired-in neurological filters (Kant called them the “a priori”) constantly sifting the barrage of sensory impressions. Then it is the result of the sifting that we study. All else is ignored. Thus the patterns we find tell us as much about the filters as about the filtered. There is something a bit tautological about this. Perhaps when the phenomena of the universe seem to obey mathematical laws, it is because one product of the nervous system - mathematics - is recognising another: the filtered sensory impressions. We are seeing the shadows of our own brains.” George Johnson Fire in the Mind Penguin, London 1997 (p 6/324) “It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness. Obviously, the messages travel in code. When messages relating to a table are traveling in the nerves, the nerve-disturbance does not in the least resemble either the external table that originates the mental impression or the conception of the table than arises in consciousness. In the central clearing station the incoming messages are sorted and decoded, partly by instinctive image-building inherited from the experience of our ancestors, partly by scientific comparison and reasoning. By this very indirect and hypothetical inference all our supposed acquaintance with and our theories of a world outside us have been built up. We are acquainted with the external world because its fibres run into our consciousness; it is only our own ends of the fibres that we actually know; from those ends, we more or less successfully reconstruct the rest, as a palaeontologist reconstructs extinct monsters from its footprints.“ Sir Arthur Eddington In Ken Wilbur Quantum Questions (p185) 

"The question is: Is Dawkins correct in believing that reductionism should not stand in conflict with our sense of wonder and awe?" I would say he is exactly right. But he seems to have no idea of how wonderful and awesome the universe is. He is a materialist and cannot imagine anything more wonderful or awesome than atoms in a void. In the end, if we keep going to the end, reductionism and holism lead us to the same place so there's no reason to suppose the former robs the world of its magic. It's just that scientists do not push reductionism to its end. They stop where they cannot think of how to reduce Matter, at the doorway to metaphysics, which is a deliberately non-reductive approach. For a fully reductive approach we have to turn to metaphysics. The most complete reductionist explanation of the world is given by Nagarjuna in his Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way, where he reduces everything. This lays out the foundation of Buddhist philosophy and it is a clear demonstration that Dawkins is right, reductionism does not rob the world of wonder and awe but reveals just how wonderful and awesome it really is. I truly believe that Dawkins has no conception of just how wonderful and awesome is the world. The way in which scientists so often defend their unimaginative metaphysical conjectures by appealing to how wonderful it makes the universe appear to them is desperately sad. They seem to have no idea of what wonder and awe really are. If they really did practice redcutionism they might find out. The problem for scientists is that reductionism leads immediately into metaphysics and most don't want to go there. So they are left endorsing reductionism but not practicing it. If they pursued it all the way to the conclusion that the Universe is a Unity, where and no further reduction is possible, they would find out what wonder and awe really are. As it is I find Dawkin's views astonishingly naive and patronising and they indicate a very low wonder and awe threshold. He does not seem to have studied philosophy or to know anything much about how the world works, or even to want to know. Perhaps it's something in his genes. Reductionism leads inevitably to maximal simplicity and it is the simplicity of the Universe that is revealed by it. This is what is so awesome, and if we do not see it then we do not see its awesomeness. The way Dawkins argues for the wonder and awesomeness of the universe reveals nothing but that he is easily impressed. From a mystics' point of view he doesn't even have his eyes open. It is possible that ranting like this against a particular person's view is bad manners on the forum but I'll risk it because this person is a danger to intelligent thought everywhere. He should become competent at philosophy before talking about these important matters but researching views he does not like is not his strength.
