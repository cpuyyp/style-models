I am not an expert, but if you ask "how can you understand why they acted the way they did?", that's beyond the scope of praxeology. I quote from Mises' Human Action: 

Youth and technology have been celebrated by an innumerably large number of people, especially the former. Rand abhorred violence, except in self-defense. 

I concur with Eliran H, so I'll answer mostly the second part of the question. First, I don't understand the pairing of Dawkins' "selfish gene" and Dennett's "consciousness explained". I am not aware of any collaboration between the two on either of these works. I know they did not coauthor the books, but I'm talking about collaboration for the concepts dealt with by them. I have read The Selfish Gene, but not Consciousness Explained. Because of this, if I am missing some connection between the two, please add an elaboration in the question for the benefit of all who have missed the connection, including myself. 

It all "boils down" to the definition of "exist"? From my perspective, if an object is not "detectable," directly or indirectly, by one or more of my 5 senses, it does not exist. Your thoughts do not exist to me unless you, some how, externalize them. 

Upon analyzing the determinism dilemma, I find that one part is false (or incomplete). I agree that all actions are either determined, or undetermined. For the determined actions, "free will" is not present. However, for the undetermined actions, there are at least two types, random and selected. Also, for the random actions, "free will"is not present. But for the selected actions, "free will" is present. This results from the application of "free will" by the selector! 

Electronics: We use boolean logic at the level of predicates. I've not come across propositional logic here. Some of the advances in the field are from finding optimal circuits for complex tasks. Linguistics: A few different kinds of logic are at the heart of many grammar formalisms such as CCG and Logical Grammar 

Epigenetics did not mean back then what it means now. Briefly, Waddington's "epigenetics" is roughly equivalent to the current word "phenotype". Far from ignoring it, Dawkins has written extensively on the topic. What is now called "epigenetic inheritance" is a very new field of study. I could expect a sequel to The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype (by someone else) after the field of epigenetic inheritance and evolution is better established. 

Your question presupposes that once a chain "gets started" it has a fixed or determined path/end - unless chance comes by and changes it (breaks the chain). This is not correct. Because of "free will," individuals don't have to depend on chance to determine what path they will follow. Chance can only make it easier or harder for a person to follow a desired path, but can not force the person to follow a particular path. So ultimately it is the person, not chance, that "breaks the chain." 

I am not familiar with other countries, but for me, in the USA, there are two reasons for voting. 1) voting facilitates my re-entry into the USA, and 2) my vote makes my party's influence stronger. 

Most Indic scripts are not as linear as Latin scripts. Devanagari features compounds and conjuncts where some letters modify other letters from left, right, above, below, or within. But why is that relevant? Indian languages can be written in a linear form as well, commonly with IAST or ITRANS. The same goes for mathematical expressions. Your two-dimensional example is often written in a linear way in LaTeX or Mathematica. 

To the extent that a philosophy of organism is required for a biology book, Dawkins already does that, with his (or Niko Tinbergen's) concept of "survival machines". 

The meaning is perfectly clear to the person who understood each of my words. It is true that I want espresso, in that context. It is false that I want sugar, in that context. 

I like to use specific examples to try to convey my thoughts clearly. So, using "marriage" as an example, I find it has at least 4 "best" definitions: 1)personal, 2)group, 3)culture, and 4)legal. Obviously, which one is best, depends on who is doing the definition. I have my own definition of marriage, and I ignore the other definitions, except the legal definition (because I have to conform to it). A group of people might get together and agree on a definition that is acceptable to all in the group. The culture of an area might dictate the definition for most of the individuals living in the given culture. But ultimately, the legal definition, will be the one that prevails (until it is legally changed). 

Academic philosophy is open to discussing all sorts of questions. Your own question is of the form . However, this seems relevant only for theologians, generally not for philosophers. I'll cite just two of the many cases that discuss the . Should the baby live?: the problem of handicapped infants 

Robert Nozick, I believe, was the first to propose an argument for something like this, in his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, pg. 169-172. I quote from pg. 169: 

By itself an utterance such as "Ouch!" does not carry a truth-value. Contrast "If I am experiencing discomfort, I will eat painkillers." with "If Ouch!, I will eat painkillers." That does not mean that a proposition cannot be derived from such utterances, the absence of any utterance, or utterances that convey the opposite of what is being stated (as is the case with sarcasm). But such things come under the purview of pragmatics, not semantics. This is why the following is plausible: 

The fallacy in your logic is your assumed implication, namely that if a "unicorn does not exist => a unicorn does not a have horn." Actually, a unicorn that does not exist can have any number (one, more than one, or no) horns! It's up to your imagination. 

There was no confusion. It derives from the influence from the Old Testament Law - "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Although this was modified by the New Testament, "if someone slaps your left cheek, put your right cheek", and "love your enemy," it has taken time for some of this attitude to get into our judicial system. Complying with the New Testament "mandate" requires the abolishing of capital punishment, but because a part of society feels it is a violence deterrent, it is retained. If we are interested in teaching our children that capital punishment is wrong, we as individuals, need to be satisfied with life imprisonment as the maximum "punishment."
