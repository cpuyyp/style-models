My background: I was a freelancer working in electronic systems in the 1970's and then computing during the 1980's and 90's, here in the UK. During that time my wife and I raised a family and we now own and live in, without mortgage, a modest three bedroom home in a good neighbourhood (Surrey Heath). Our home is currently valued at around £250,000 (EU: €351641.60, US: $387262.50 according to google). In the 70's I was a sub-sub-sub-sub-contractor which meant other people got wealthy, while I did all the work, but I digress... I retired, partly for health reasons, at age 50. The term used for us in the 80's and 90's was "Contract { Skill-level | Function }" e.g. Contract Senior Systems Analyst/Programmer or "{ Computer | name of language | Function ] Contractor" e.g. Computer Contractor, COBOL Contractor, or according to my accountant, Tax-efficient LTD (US: LLC) Contractor! Takeaway: My points are: I may know what I am writing about. Be your own boss. This was some while ago (hopefully still useful to somebody). Other regions on Earth may vary, and... MOST importantly for this discussion... that somewhere along the line the emphasis on contract seems to have been lost. Assuming that you have a contract with the company / corporation concerned then carry on reading. You may wish to set aside your engineering approach to this issue (Shock, Horror! OK, just for a short while). View youself as a business person might see you. There are some subtle differences! I have never described myself as an engineer. I have been everything from shop (US: store) assistant through coder to Department head at a sub of a huge US Corp. I've been an employee, a contractor, and hired (and fired) both. I believe that your intellect, your qualifications, and a large measure of common sense is your best guide. Your mission is entirely your call and if you document it and and refer to it often, it will form a large part of your individual success. The job (that you do for the organisation buying your services) should be exactly as specified in the contract, no less, and no more. You didn't specifically ask about strategy, but that is very important, and again, that is your call i.e. you figure it out. I learned some of the above the hard way from experience. I later realised that at least two out of three of a Personnel department's "Three Tells" for permanent staff can be applied to Contracting/Consulting:- 

You wanted to evaluate all your options before entering another long term commitment (which isn't far from the truth) The truth, an offer was extended shortly after you left your position (which makes you look desirable) but the employer withheld vital information from you until the last minute and you had to pull back You wanted a break to catch your breath after X number of years with the last shop 

I'd recommend you contact the manager again via email and address your concerns squarely (with a little more detail/finesse of course): 

Boring, vanilla, and dispensable in political discourse. Your interview will switch quickly to the meat of your interview: the job 

Itemise what your client expects of you Cause your client to think deeper and better about what exactly they want Cause your client to express himself better, in a structured, concise manner Cause you both to dialogue on the change request and come to an agreement before pressing forward. 

Your question doesn't state whether you present alternatives and get shot down. If you're asking based solely on the fact that you're simply presented with an option you don't like, I'd suggest you either suck it in and do what's best for the team or constructively lay out options in a non-threatening manner. If however you're being forced to implement design choices you don't agree with(for good, cogent reasons!) and your suggestions are being shot down, I'll suggest you provide documented communication (emails, design docs etc) that clearly state your own design . Such docs shouldn't be a comparison but neutrally presented. Make this design available to your lead preferably before he comes up with his, so he's more likely to give yours a fair look while doing his thing. It also has the benefit of making sure your views are on record in case the project goes to pieces due to poor design. A question you should ask is : Does the alternate application design have a desirable outcome? Because at the end of the day, that is what matters: the project. If you're making a stand on a design choice , you need to be sure why you think yours is better or what the other guy's suggestion is doing to hurt the project. It takes strength and maturity to take the high road in a clash of wills. It doesn't make you weak. You need to be able to put the project before opinion. Being the lead, ultimately the responsibility of the failure or success of the project rests on him. 

Simply explain that you learned a lot while you were there and feel like coding is not your future. You're an intern, you're young and at a major crossroads in your life and your employer has been there before too. He should understand what it is like, and an intern is not a massive investment for a company to begin with. 

You're negotiating, and the most powerful negotiation tactic there is, is to walk away. Whoever is prepared to walk has the most power. You aren't prepared to walk if you don't find another job first. 

I worked 4 different summer internships in college and the wages were as follows: $12/hr for 30 hours per week. $15/hr for 40 hours per week. $5000 + housing over 10 weeks. $6000 over 10 weeks. Were better wages available? Sure, but I took many other factors into account. For the first two I was able to live at home and commute ~30 minutes per day and saved a lot of money by not renting a place. You may want to re-think your wage scale though. $25/hr for 40 hours is the equivalent of $52k salary, which is pretty bad for a developer, but for an intern with no work experience its extremely high. The most important thing to consider are what kind of doors an internship opens for you. Are the technologies used growing in relevance? Is this a company you would consider working for after graduation? Is it a name that would be recognizable on your resume? 

On the other hand, you might want to think long term. You won't always have the luxury of picking with whom you're stuck. If there's any possibility of giving this person another shot/opening channels of dialogue, I'd advise it. 

This is your problem then. To sort this out, I'd recommend you start by striking up conversation on something you're actually interested in. Not B.S-ing your way through a topic or subject you couldn't give a flying dutchman about. Also pick your targets carefully, in the same vein. 3 business cards from people you actually have stuff in common with will serve you better (and be easier on your memory) than a fistful of business cards from people you barely have anything in common and you're going to forget as soon as you turn heel. 

Part of your responsibility as a consultant (I presume) is managing your client and his expectations. As a professional developer, the onus is on you to set the standard operating procedure when relating with clients. When I relate with a client I set the following minimum 

I think you made a big mistake in not going to the lunch. I've had to hire people before and the single most important thing I was always looking for was "Do I want to spend 40 hours a week working with this person?" Something less formal like a lunch more closely simulates what it would be like sitting next to someone all day. I want someone that makes my day more enjoyable, and the standard interview is often more focused on business and you don't act anything like you would on a daily basis during a formal interview. Basically if you were tied with another candidate in qualifications, but the other one made me laugh over a beer at lunch, you're out of the running. Maybe your country is different, but when in Rome. 

If they made you a promise, even if it was verbal and not written (you should have asked for it in writing though), then there is nothing at all wrong with asking them to make good on it. If he doesn't bring it up himself then simply bring it up at the end of the day/meeting/whenever you see him. You will not be punished for inquiring about a promise that was made to you. This is business, you can't be afraid to negotiate. If you do it in a respectful way the worst you'll get is a no. 

I'll recommend some caution here. Are you fully aware of the level of the relationship between your current employer and the people they've brought in? I ask this because flogging your skills to them could backfire, i.e. they could possibly rat you out to your current employer. Doesn't even have to be intentional on their part. It simply could slip out in an informal setting like the one where they came to pitch to you. If you've the luxury of time, try to build your own personal, informal relationship with these guys and then pitch. Or look elsewhere 

There are two separate concerns here, it's important to not conflate the two. Address both the way you normally would, individually and impartially.

Tell me what my job is (Job description, as per your contract). Tell me how to do it. (Training. Vital for permanent staff. Should not strictly be necessary if you're selling yourself as a professional, but it is great to get paid to be trained in new skills!). Tell me when I'm doing it right, or not. (Regular reviews with your supervisor (aka Customer) are essential, both for YOU and THEM. That is your time and theirs. It should be used to discuss matters only affecting yourself and not be wasted trying to correct other people's shortcomings. As Jane S. wrote, "...[blockages] need to be raised...". Correct, but are you sure they are not "dating" or "an item" even? Imagine now what names you would call yourself if that was the reason for management's apparent head-in-sand approach toward this employee! and worse: the reason they chose not to renew your contract!). 

If you wish to discuss your contract, then your accountant would be a good place to start. She or he may advise you to either "suck it up" for the remainder of your four months, or approach the appropriate person in the organisation for a review and/or update of your contract. That should be done anyway as the end of your contract approaches. If you don't have an experienced, qualified, accountant then you're not really a professional IMNSHO. A good one will save you more than you pay them, if not, get a different one. Your performance (and possible contract extension/renewal) will be not be assessed on how often you implicitly tell your customer that he is doing his job wrong. It will depend on how well YOU work and fit in with what we called the "permie's" or "permie-burgers!", i.e. the permanent staff. It is unlikely to depend on how adept you are at office politics. As a contractor that 'skill' is best left unused. Unless of course your contract includes provision of (cough) Management Consultancy service(s). {wink}. Never forget: You are probably worth more than you think you are. Don't sell yourself short, and ENJOY what you do.. That is probably more detail than needed, I hope it helps, Mart ~ ~ 

Another point to note is that no one likes to be called out in public. No one. I make it a point to can it until after team meetings to consult with my supervisor on glaring misconceptions he had during the meeting. I'm not saying watch everyone drive off a cliff but do not make someone or group of people out to look funny in public cold light of day. Ask questions that will hopefully lead to the discovery of the fact that you already know , instead of pointedly stating that everyone else is wrong. 

Do not lie about the nature of the opportunity. Advertise the role as is. The job ad was for a senior JEE developer with a strong finance background. Then came the interview and it turned out what they really wanted was to retrain me in the proprietary platform and use me exclusively for that. I looked around for job opportunities with that language and found exactly 6. On 3 major jobs sites. Don't misrepresent the position. I turned down the offer the first time and gave the above reasons. Make sure you have an appealing and versatile platform. One major downside to the platform I was invited on was it's poor support for xml, among other things. I mean what kind of language doesn't let you manipulate xml? Work on your product,make it robust and truly deliver value, don't just concentrate on your effort to lock your clients into your platform (which is pretty much what these guys here have wound up doing). Be very clear that the work environment will be balanced. They'll not be pigeon-holed into the proprietary platform. It was on this basis only that I eventually took the job and my manager has been true to his words. I'm primarily a Java developer and dabble in the proprietary platform
