So, the year before the 'details' of: (1) the black body problem (2) Brownian motion (3) the photoelectric effect; turned out to require all of quantum mechanics. And dealing with the apparent absence of the assumed 'ether' required special relativity. We have: dark energy and dark matter, the nature of singularities, the origins of the big bang, the nature of time, renormalisation problems in quantum mechanics, the fine tuning problem; among the ideas that pop into mind. It seems like hubris, to think none of these threads will unravel more than they sew up. If QM & GR are unified in an 'uncomplicated' way, it would still only be a theory of 'everything' like atomic theory accounts for all of chemistry. That is, explanatory in principle not in practice. Many remaining theories of new phenomena will need to arise, and be attached to the tree of knowledge arising out of any TOE - and some of those branches will have to solve major outstanding ng problems like whether BQP = NP On a practical level, given issues around computability, things may not be within the scope of explanation-prediction in practice from a TOE, within the constraint of the matter and energy in the universe. So, would be in seperate explanatory 'emergent layers' supervening onto the TOE reality. Our own specific consciousnesses are the kind of thing which might evade such co putation limits. Because vast series' of unlikely events may be involved in getting to a specific outcome, there may still be limits on how much detail we simulate our own history with, and so a human in practice attached to such a chain of causation may evade in subtle ways predictions of that humany in theory, limiting explanation-prediction of this to probabalistic predictions, even in definite situations. Whether this is a limit on explaining 'everything' depends on how you define explanations. But I would suggest if you can't predict someone fully your understanding of them is in some sense incomplete. 

I remember reading an explanation of Aristotle's eudaimonia, describing it as 'human flourishing' and locating it in his background as a student of plants and biology. If we look at his views on mind and body: 

No. E.g. ' Foucault Truth And The Death Of God' $URL$ Postmodernism is the stance that meaning isn't universal and outside ourselves. Nihilism is the stance that meaning is essentially a fiction. 

To look out on the universe and only feel empty and alone, seems essentially egotistical and selfish. How can you not feel awe, wonder, at this vast cosmos we are so near the beginning of starting to understand? Perhaps that feeling of wonder is the flourishing of life that has found balance, or perhaps it is the seed which starts the journey there. Cultivate a sense of wonder, exercise that part of being and seek experiences with which it arises. Take forward sincerely held questions into that, and be sure if you can hold on to the question the answers are out there. 

Physicists in general, have absolutely no interest in philosophy, or in doubting the foundations of how they know things. Even the philosophically inclined and capable like Einstein, generally fight for conservative positions rather than radical ones (look to Kuhn on why). Physics gets on with observations, experiments, and calculations. Philosophy, including philosophy of science and philosophy of physics, is about something else. These do cover what we know about the world, and how we know it, and how we should do the practice of physics. Crucially, more generally it is also a space for asking questions which cannot be settled by observations, experiments, and calculations. Many physicists feel such questions are intrinsically meaningless, or at least irrelevant. But that is because they are using the tools that have resulted from a settled consensus on the answers to many questions they don't consider, answers which they take for granted. In this age of dark matter and energy, of coming to recognise the huge challange of unifying the fundamental forces such as in addressing what time itself is, the foundations of physics have never needed questioning more. The current impasse is likely a result of the fact that the next places we need to go, are stranger than we can currently imagine. It will take more than just observations to get there. 

Practical emergentism, is compatible philosophically with reductionism. Reductionism must hit problems in ability to make predictions, based on the limits of total matter and energy in the universe and what data could be held and computed. Non linear dynamics mean the universe can only fully compute a single timeline of everything in it. The multiverse may be a computation of all possible initial conditions and timelines: $URL$ Emergentism, such as predicting behaviour based on psycology, can offer huge shortcuts on computation for predicting outcomes. This treats an explanatory layer as supervening on a more fundamental one, while accepting that it is in principle reducible. Another example is Multi Level Selection. Group Selection is problematic, because it implies that the new group-unit can become more fundamental than it's constituent genes. MLS resolves this by proposing additional explanatory order, which does not. When we look at humans, we see a future of digitally uploading and otherwise seeming obviations of the gene. But the gene is actually a record of adaption to niche, a kind of timeline of being. We can never create a digital mind 'from nothing', it must be attached to such a timeline, in the same way we need exposure to culture as well as genes. Additional layers of order occur, but never supercede previous ones. I am thinking of Deutsche's description of understanding genetics as crucial to understanding The Fabric Of Reality. We expect simplicity and elegance to the order of the universe, as shown by the increasing unification of fields and expectation of a unified field theory. Many expect a unified substance $URL$ Reductionism in this context is really saying, we expect a timeline that goes from simple to complex. Do we also need holism? Yes, anc again it is compatible. In that early simplicity, all particles were probably entangled. The emergeging idea of an axiom of purification, suggests the arrow of time is in the direction of increased mixing of initially pure states, which means a particle cannot be fully accounted for without reference to all previously entangled partners. My impression is that this can picture all possible futures as part of a multidimensional surface. So then you think, why do you subjectively experience just this one worldline? Just like a fundamental particle, in this picture we in fact experience all possible worldlines, 'seperated' by 6 of the dimensions being rolled up (ie having limited extent into our universe). It is not a dichotomy. Reductionism and emergentism can both be essential to a working understanding of, and creation of a meaningful model of, our universe and wider reality.
