Using this general logical argument that Charles Pierce employed against nominalists, we can twist it slightly to point out the oddity in Hume's position of trying to make out any sense of 'impression' that doesn't welcome as well the sense of relation between 'impressions'. Pierce's argument, in short, amounts to this: how can we hope to logically preserve our ability to recognize impressions when we attack our ability to recognize the relations that persist between them? Change would be viewed on this model not in the presupposed, reductionist epistemological language as one distinct impression following upon another, a language that threatens the continuity of identity shared between impressions themselves which (according to Pierce) in turn threatens any identity of any sensory image, but as one subsistent object losing or gaining something. Sellarsian Argument Another recent insight that we might use to reject the radically skeptical Humean conclusions is to accept the new findings by Wilfrid Sellars (among others) regarding the 'myth oft the given.' The short of this argument is that nothing can serve as a justification in our field of knowledge besides something that is itself conceptually significant. Put in other words, knowledge isn't an entirely passive experience. The human subject participates in knowledge. This in itself tells us that action, which is in turn a subcategory of change, is a real feature. But putting that point aside, we can apply this insight to Humean epistemology and, in doing so, see the justification of the insight itself. For Hume to even talk about this impression compared to that impression is an activity that is loaded down with conceptuality, which is composed, in turn, of relations. The Sellarsian would say to the Humean something like this: you are already caught in commitments to relations, such as cause and effect, before you try to bring us back down to the epistemically barren wasteland of 'impressions.' This is self-evidenced in that it is not your impressions that are justifying any of your positions: it is your comparative, relational logic. This argument, while not flatly disproving Hume's specific epistemological opinions about causality, does get after something that is probably more important: motivation. This argument asks Hume why he's trying to pull off his whole program in the face of the fact that it is relations themselves that are epistemologically more basic than sensations (at least as far as explicit knowledge goes). In Sellarsian fashion we would say to Hume that it is not sensory impressions that should compel all talk of justification: it is, on the contrary, the conceptually significant relations that are actually affirmed or negated. Psychological Argument Another argument against the Humean criticism of causality is pretty basic. In short, it wants to get after the normativity of causality as experienced. Why is it that we connect certain successive events in a causal way while we don't connect other successive events in a causal way? Hume never seems to get after the full explanation of the causal phenomenon itself. When he poses this question to himself, he busies himself with tackling the problem of inference, but even this consideration implicitly assumes the phenomenon of past causal connections rather than effectively reducing them away. In other words, he is always caught taking advantage of causal connections rather than truly reducing them to distinct impressions. This is why Kant, in response to Hume, held to the irreducibility of the principle of causality, if not as a principle of reality, then as a principle of mind. 

Logically, if the only proof of existence we have is what we can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, and feel the movement of, why do many philosophies deal with issues outside the physical? Due to these scientific limitations of not being able to prove anything nonphysical (not limited to entities/ concepts surrounding spirituality and religion[s]) exists in any concrete way that affects our daily lives in ways that WE OURSELVES don't choose it to, why doesn't philosophy eliminate these concepts? 

In this day and age with modern medicine, the line between life and death are blurred, as the brain dead may act as if it's alive, and the alive, due to being comatose may be reposed as if dead. What does physicalism say about this blurred line of life and death? 

This question is difficult to answer because the idea of a "philosophical question" is very vague. The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps podcast begins with Thales of Miletus (7th Century BCE), and a number of sources list him as the first identifiable philosopher in the Western tradition. However in a more general sense you would also be able to argue that philosophy has existed almost as long as society - any parent who has had to explain to their questioning child why it is important to treat other people well, for example, could be said to be "doing philosophy" in a broad sense. 

Essentially, the main insight I would take from this passage is to realise that all arguments can be phrased as a conditional statement of the general form (if , then ). The fact that any logically valid argument forms a tautology when this is done is a result of this. 

And given these guidelines, can the idea still live on today in the echoes of other philosophies? If so what do other philosophers have to say about being a renaissance man? For those who want an overview of famous renaissance men, they can be found here 

How do we really know that we (and everything else) wasn't created an instant ago, and everything we remember from the past is an illusion, a figment of our imagination to comfort ourselves from seeing and remembering the truth that all is not as it seems? 

In the code of Hammurabi, one of the first laws put forth was "an eye for an eye." We've come a long way since those times both as a society, and in terms of making laws - as well as the ability to provide justice, yet, the idea(s) of equal punishment for a crime still is seen as a valid point. Why? 

The question isn't particularly clear about what you mean by "what kind" of argument, however Modal Logic primarily deals with the possibility and necessity of statements like the one in the question. Probability is a different option that is used in various systems (such as multi-valued logics that assign each proposition a probability value such as 0.7, with computations from those). In modal logic, your argument would be written as follows: 

Now if you put these two ideas together and assert as your antecedent the assertion that W ∧ X ∧ Y, and make your consequent C. That is, 

From the premise of the initial quote that the argument is valid there can be no case where you are posing the antecedent's statement (W ∧ X ∧ Y) as true and the consequent (C) false. Thus, it is a tautology as there is no case in which the statement itself is false. (Note that this necessitates that W,X,Y includes ALL premises of the argument we know to be valid, not just some subset of them.) 

Throughout life there are many choices: do we eat something fast, or do we cook our own food? Do we skimp (or totally skip) healthcare/ dental coverage, or get regular checkups? Do we hookup with people, or do we have something steady with one person (or a few regulars)? Do we take the job that's physically demanding but pays well or the less demanding job with less pay? Do we cut corners to get a job done or do we work hard and ethically, even if it costs us more in the end? Each one of these choices is a trade-off. You might get fast food, but it's not healthy. We might save money on our health initially, but then come up with a disease that is severe but manageable, or something incurable (such as certain STDs) and so on. Even if it works for the majority, is it still right due to the consequences that need to be paid later on? Also, does the fact that we know that these habits are unhealthy play a factor in determining right and wrong? If so, what part? 

Hume's criticism of causality is a direct consequence of his epistemological system. You can't really understand Hume's thoughts on necessity and the causal relations between objects (or events) unless you understand how Hume thinks we experience said objects. Hume divides all knowledge into 'relations of ideas' and 'matters of fact' (this is, as you point out, 'Hume's fork'). The former Hume believes to be entirely the construct of humans, and to a probably lesser extent, so too does Hume believe the latter to be of human construct. For Hume, matters of fact are really private sense images, or 'impressions,' only secondarily experienced via memory in what he calls 'ideas.' Relations that persist between any two ideas are based entirely in Hume's threefold list of associations: resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect. What is interesting is that Hume always talks about these associations in the context of human action. This is in keeping with his general commitment to viewing these associations as being entirely human constructions that in no way are founded in the basic impressions themselves. Given this outline, it should come as no surprise that Hume sees the notion of cause and effect as falling into the category of 'relations of ideas,' and as being, in consequence, entirely of human construction: 

Firstly, I suggest that you make sure that we're talking about formal philosophy and not 'formal logic', 'formalism' or other areas of philosophy that might use the term in their title, as these likely have much more specific meanings. As far as I know, there is no real definition for what formal philosophy is. In my experience, most people and writers seem to use it as a distinction between philosophy that adheres to certain standards of rigour and explanatory completeness rather than simply asking questions and proposing ideas that seem relevant to a given philosophical concept. Analytic philosophy tries to adhere to this for the most part. Depending on the context, it might also refer to the way that philosophy is taught or learned - e.g. studying at a university under a philosophy professor might be called "studying philosophy in a formal way", etc., as opposed to, say, reading a few books and asking/answering questions on the internet - this might be called "informally studying philosophy" (though I am not saying that one is necessarily better than the other). 

Since the starting blocks of knowledge are distinct, separate ideas that in no way persist beyond their material existence , Hume's criticism of causality is the natural skeptical conclusion that Hume must eventually arrive at. Hume's first founding blocks of knowledge are purged of all their ability to ground the relations that persist between them. Any relations between sensations, including cause and effect, are entirely human concoctions. Arguments Against the Humean Project Piercean Argument You don't need to be a realist to take trouble with Hume's epistemological system. However, an argument might be given against Hume's epistemological program that borrows from a phenomenological argument used against nominalism by the late, great Charles Pierce. He writes:
