Example: Can you get me a coffee da , get off the computer, da even just give me a name, da in Kannada English code switched sentence. And Cosmo in Gaurdians of the Galaxy new Comic series can give one examples for Russian. 

Would it be right if I guessed that not "seeing" what one is trying to convey, hampers the rate of language acquisition or hampers semantics? Would it affect only the noun and adjective class objects or would it not affect anything at all? (would be thankful if the right tags are added) 

(Disclaimer: ..surely have read John C. Wells’s article “Syllabification and allophony... no to both of the things, i am a high school student interested in linguistics) 1) since you labelled this question as phonotactics, each language has its own phonotactics, thus making some syllables feasible and pronouncable and "seamless" in that particular language thus: a) /ˈdɪst.rɪkt/ -> you would have to literally pronounce it like two words ~seamless~ b) /ˈekstr.ə/ -> "kstr" ~feasible~ in English , also American English generally allows a vowel-only-last-syllable when it is aspirated so even if "ekstr" was possible, it would have to end with "əh" (with that h flying above) 2) A language should have syllables that exist or fit phonology coszily a)/'dɪstr.ɪkt/ -> both syllables don't already exist in major dialects of English (by syllables I mean separate syllables independently, not like "distract" also has the same string of characters so it should be right to separate distr) b) wood , mid, row and riff already exist as common words / prefixes (which I know is not the case here) and that's the point, it's (idk psychologically?) easier to break words into known parts rather than maintaining some rules. Take a non-existent word - Bigred , did you pronounce this like big-red in your mind? Why not bigr-ed (maybe that's right because of some rule which says gr is indivisible as it exists in grass , Groot and so on) but no big and red are "easier" to pronounce. 3) you can (mostly) only pronounce what the spelling says (it's stating the obvious) a) since monstrous is not monsterous it is pronounced as ˈmɒns.trəs/ and not the other one. /ˈdɪ.strɪkt/ (I am not really sure of, but I think two consonant clusters make it a really heavy syllable in English, but in other languages like Hindi you can actually pronounce it easily and it is a spoken variant around here in India) In the end, regarding /dr, tr/... (Those are too many linguistic terms hope the info above and people around here help) (Curly waves mean a cut through the word) 

Welcome to Linguistics SE. The answer to your question would be yes ( is what I think ), since all cultures/languages have names and all names are proper nouns. Now, that is just one case, but it answers your question. Were you meaning to ask about any other class of proper nouns? 

The Balinese numbers in dependent and independent forms are given as linked. I just need to verify the assumptions that I made about the (possibly reduplicated) derived, independent form. 1) if the first syllable has a CV form, change it to CV1CV2 where if V2 is a or u V1 is a otherwise if V2 is e or i V1 is e. 2) if the first syllable starts with an optional a, the a turns into a permanent vowel. (it sticks) Note: thanks for the edit @user6726 

1) Does it change, even slightly, due weakening of the last consonant sound? 2) If it does what is this phenomenon called? 

Reduplication (a natural language feature) which changes meaning, pluralize, emphasize etc. is basically doubling of the word, partially doubling it or doubling it with phonetic constraints. Grice's maxim of manner, when one tries to be as clear, as brief, and as orderly as one can in what one says, and where one avoids obscurity and ambiguity. The maxim of quantity, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as is needed, and no more. Does this doubling , oppose Grice's Maxim of Manner or Quantity? Or if Grice's Maxims are not to be compared with one particular linguistic feature, does it follow all others? 

The dot diacritic works for [dzo] to [jo] , for [do] to [ro] and for [dho] to [rho]. But /ba/ and /ra/ are completely unrelated sounds, so what is the dot doing to /ba/? 

You can maybe try relating it to common phones in words of your language , for starters and then develop upon the harder ones (non-local-phones). For example, in English the 'question mark thingy' in IPA is the middle of 'uh-oh' and 'x' is the sound in Lochness. 

Competete a variant of Compete used in colloquial speech, but is written with the same spelling as the latter, has come into use (at the least) in Indian English variants if in no other English variants. The question here is how could it have been formed? I had a few ideas of my own: 1) It is maybe the result of -tion deletion which generally adds a t sound in return, thus adding an extra t sound after compete. 2) It is maybe the pronunciation /kum-pe-ti-shun/ and not /kom-puh-ti-shun/ which requires the extra t sound syllable to maintain the pronunciation stress on pe - /kum-pe-teet/ and not /kum-peet/ Edit: this is unlike association -> associate and connotation -> connotate 

Discontinuous dependencies are a part of English syntatic rules and also are something which linguists are still trying to deal with. My question: which other languages have this problem and how does that language speakers deal with long spread discontinuous dependencies (as in big bulky noun phrases)? Edit: An example of what I state as a problem (of rearrangement) It is a feature that when tried to fiddle with, gets problematic. She will easily put the clock down -> she will put down the clock easily. Seems fine, but when the easily part gets bulkier it's tougher to rearrange for example she stood up all those men who had offered her diamonds (Akmajian) . Will you not "struggle" a bit to arrive at she stood all those men up who had offered her diamonds . 

Are all the words above from the same root (PIE)? Or are these a bunch of false cognates like behtar (Farsi) better (English). 

There is one that I know of: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Here is the link (also a NIST competition) 

Refer: WALS feature 3A A simple Google search yielded - $URL$ which could be one of the reasons. But can anyone come up with some other reasons maybe concerning historical linguistics etc. 

Generally, Mood is marked by suffixes, prefixes, infixes etc. But are there languages which have mood marked by phonetic changes at syllable / word boundaries? 

(Disclaimer: I don't have much background in linguistics) I think - if you are relating to agglutinantive and not polysynthetic languges - it would depend on what you are trying to build and the language too. But, Staatspolizei (Secret State Police) may occur around words like- The (whereas polizei would require and adjective before e.g. The Secret-State-Police vs The secret Police), found (... Staatspolizei found and staats polizei found can have ambiguous interpretations if the language allows it, XYZ found something and XYZ found by me) etc. changing it's use totally. whereas purushottama (man + ultimate/best/ideal = ideal man) is as you can see a compound of Noun + Adj. in that order, in Hindi , Sanskrit and other languages where it might be used purush uttama asti (please ignore grammatical/morphological endings if wrong) and purushottama asti have different meanings; The man is ideal and The ideal man (is) exists. also purush uttama karya karta hai and purushottam karya karta hai mean The man does the best work and The ideal man does work respectively (The Adj. might be used to modify verb occuring in the same position) The above distinctions thus, show that treating them as unigrams would be better than treating them as n-grams as far as the semantic role is concerned. Hope that helps! :)
