You can use the format to add the additional IP addresses. Just be sure to add the appropriate netmask to each network. You can route additional networks on each interface as shown. 

Your key is now published as . However, it appears the text field is too long and may not be parsed correctly. The TXT data must be broken into text segments of no more than 255 characters. See Implement DKIM with Exim for a couple of format options for publishing if your DNS server is . If your internal DNS configuration is different from the external DNS configuration ensure the public key is published to the external DNS. You will also need it configured on the internal DNS to test from the command line. 

There is no need to put or any other form of load balancer in front of your border SMTP servers. If you don't get the configuration right, it is likely to hurt your ability to successfully deliver mail. Just put your servers in your DMZ. Incoming traffic will be part way through a conversation before you can route it appropriately. IMAP users will be attempting to login. SMTP servers will be at the command, and may be attempting to deliver the same message to different domains for which you are listed as the MX. It is common to use names like for farms of servers. For each of these servers. The domain you use for your mail server(s) rarely matches the server name. For common services like SMTP, Web, IMAP, POP and other it is common to publish and use service names in addition (or instead of) host names. Load balance your MX servers by publishing them at the same priority. 

Your original code will continually truncate and write the same file. The loop above will continually create new files. The command is atomic, and the reader will always see a file with data. This will be either the file deleted by the or the new file. 

From the timestamps it looks like you updated several programs built Dec-19th about 7:30. Modification timestamps should be the build timestamps. It depends on how they get moved into place. Some programs are linked to through /etc/alternatives, and the symbolic links will have the timestamp of the install.This could be an automatic security update. Check Check your file from then. It is likely compressed and rotated, but can be read with /var/log/aptitude.log`. Many packages have md5sums that can be used to verify that the files they contain haven't been modified. It is safest to run statically linked tools from a read-only media which contains the comparison checksums. However, if you don't think the md5 toolchain is compromised you can use the local files. Programs like usually require a switch to enable updating their database of checksums. You may want to run the program before running updates, and then again after the updates with the switch to capture the changed hash codes. 

If you are not connecting to a host on your local network, the address seen by won't be which can not be routed over the Internet. If you are connecting between hosts on a local network, most systems will try IPv6 first. IPv6 is not as easy to block on a per host basis, as hosts often are configured to use privacy extensions and change their IP address periodically. If this is a host you have access to, then after connecting using ssh and check the IP address you are connecting from. exports information about the connection to the environment. You can view this with the command . You may want to implement a mostly closed configuration. Keep a connection open while testing Configure to block all connections with a like this. 

This will reset each users home directory tree to be owned by that user. In the rare case that the home directory name does not match the userid this will fail. Postfix will also need access to its spool directories. 

I would create a new proxy user for the VPN to connect to. Add your IT users to an appropriate group if they are not already in one. Create a filter to limit access of the VPN's id to members of the group. 

As you haven't configured the users to login using a desktop mangager, they likely need to configure their session using a file. It may be simpler to configure VNC using XDMCP to start the session. I've had success running Remote Desktops with VNC and RDP. For VNC sessions, it worked better using XDMCP. Using XRDP, the desktop gets launched by the XRDP daemon. 

Rate limiting connections or blocking the sending addresses should help resolve the issue. You may need help from your provider if volume is too high for your connection. 

It appears you may be triggering a spam filtering rule. Your address is listed in the Spamhaus PBL list which indicates your IP address should not be originating email to the Internet. Spamhaus provides clear documentation on their policies. If you want reliable delivery to the Internet the server sending to the Internet needs a fixed IP address with DNS configured to pass rDNS validation. Your mail server should identify itself with the domain you have configured for rDNS. If you don't have a fixed IP address with appropriate DNS entries use your provider's email relay server to deliver the email. As other have noted you seem to have an extra header being added. This may be causing header validation to fail. (SPAM is much more likely to have bad headers than valid email.) 

If all you run is a web server a secondary DNS may not seem that important. However, when your server is down there are a number of reasons you may want a backup DNS server, including: 

This is standard behavior to prevent IP conflicts. It is dicussed in RFC 5227 IPv4 Address Conflict Detection. It also allows routers and neighbors to update their ARP tables so they can communicate with your computer. By asking who has an IP address it is possible to determine if the IP address is in use. This allows the computer to at least log the existence of a conflict if one exists. It is this mechanism that allows a computer to use automatic IP address configuration to work using the 169.254.0.0/16 address block. Computers generate an address in this range, and then use APR to see if it available. If not they try other addresses until they find one available. As the networks are usually small and the address range covers over 65000 addresses, they can find an address quickly. The utility builds a database based on the arp messages which can be used to notify administrators if address are in conflict, or are being moved to new hardware. 

You can use the server logs to determine how much bandwidth you are serving up. A tool like awstats will report the bandwidth served. Incoming bandwidth is not reported, but is usually significantly less the outgoing bandwidth.
