Here's an interesting article from the Smithsonian on the matter. Depends on a vast number of factors. If high gravity -Strong bone structure, or perhaps life stays at a cellular level. Powerful structure stronger than bone arises to be used by the creatures. There's a book called Dragons Egg written Robert L. Forward. His book had sentient aliens the size of sesame seeds. Suffice to say, natural selection will exist. So a light gaseous planet (Neptune) could have vast flying beasts that metabolize methane and hover in the upper atmosphere. It could drift upwards and downwards much like a jellyfish does and regulates its body temperature with the fluctuations of the planet. The ingredients of life (that we know off) are hydrocarbons that can form to become amino acids. Richards Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene, talks about a vague shade of life called the Replicator. A super simple process (if you can even call it life) that repeatedly formed complex chains of amino acids. This later become the Prime mover (in a Aristotelian sense) that progressed to more complex lifeforms as competition took hold and mistakes in replication accidentally allowed DNA became more competitive to rivals and increasingly intricate in an evolutionary arms race. We exist to further our genes. A lifeform on a different planet could use a different replication strategy. Some crazy different alternative to DNA. Or something that looks very like DNA. Its reasonably safe to assume Darwinism will hold true across the universe. If we find Earth 2.0, we could see life that are very similar depending on the epoch. (Ruled by dinosaurs, insects, bacteria). Its very unlikely you will find bi pedal monkeys! But you may see the same natural designs manifest themselves. Eyes (something that has cropped up independently in evolutionary history), spines, a gut, hair, claws/thorns/sharp implements, feelers/fingers/claws for grasping. But in beautiful much different ways that if humans encountered it, we might not recognize it at first. In heavy gravity planets you could have vast hiveminds, much like termites/bee's here. Heavy planets like Jupiter have hugely powerful storms. They could disperse like pollen across a vast planet in great migrations. Using minerals to form a shell as protection against the elements. Maybe crafting them in a way that allows them to be airborne for longer? Using the powerful magnetism generated by the tectonics to guide vast tribes to distant shores. Creatures similar to insects/crustaceans are a good bet. They are fantastically profligate as species and have arisen independently a few times in nature. Trilobites are one of the most successful species ever to exist. External shells are very good against predators and external dangers. On a hostile planet, maybe a creeping fungi uses that can draw electricity strikes to set aflame to flammable elements like potasssium/hydrogen and water to utilize the useful chemicals. And when storms abates absorbs what light it can and uses to rest to split the rest of the elements and try create some delicious proteins... Ants communicate by smell, and dogs can communicating by licking and body language. Whales can convey meaning with a type of spray they exhibit. Maybe creatures that are totally blind (in our sense) but can change colour in a different spectrum, can convey Ulysses in smell, spray or lick. Living in vast swarms exchanging olfactory information about the great sense-scape they felt last lunar cycle... The real answer is the possibilities are endless. Within our planet look how much complexity that we barely understand evolved. How many wonderful species are gone forever that we just don't know about! 

To get away from idiots. What is holding people up from creating that perfect society? You know, the one where kids can walk to school unescorted and nobody has locks on their doors because it is inconceivable that anyone would open somebody else's door uninvited? Idiots. Antisocial jerks who just don't want to play along with your society. You can try to build your Utopia on Earth, but most of the good places are taken and filled up with idiots and jerks. Let's face it, most of the human population are idiots and jerks who need years of training and conditioning just to tie their own shoes, and all of that socialization still doesn't prevent them from taking your stuff if it isn't nailed down or chained to something really big. Having to nail your stuff down or chain it to large objects is super inconvenient. So if you want to make a society on Earth that doesn't suck, you have to do something about all of those idiots and jerks. The most common approaches, such as relocating them to some other place with a suitable habitat or turning them into fertilizer, have distinct drawbacks. That leaves relocating yourself and like-minded associates to some other place that is hard to get to. The "hard to get to" part is pretty important, as the idiots will definitely follow you if you're just going across the street. There might be other considerations when planning your colony, but the "better society" angle will be hard to overlook after the first colony is established. Consider: Transport to your colony will be difficult and expensive, and the number of slots for colonists will be limited, so when interviewing for those slots you will be focusing on getting only the best and brightest. In other words, the colony will be built from only the smartest and most capable individuals that humanity has to offer. Idiots need not apply. The society such people could build would be enviable, which is why the idiots would want to get there. To the idiot's way of thinking, "Wouldn't it be great to live in a place where nobody ever locked their bikes? I could steal bikes whenever I wanted to!" 

Tech Already Exists (Raytheon is basically already into SCIFI level stuff) This is the pike Missile by Raytheon (still in final testing, soon to be deployed.) 

I actually have some experience detecting things underground (mine sweeping in 3rd world nations.) It depends as to what you are trying to hide its detection from. The most likely tool used to detect a body in a cemetery would be ground penetrating radar. Fooling ground penetrating radar is more of a function of clutter than of depth, since all it detects in the cavity in the soil created by the object. Burying a body directly on top of another grave could do the trick, preferably inside the casket with the remains of another body. Keep in mind that coffins aren't actually buried alone, but in concrete sarcophagi designed to prevent the ground from caving in and creating a depression on the surface when the casket decays. The lids are pretty heavy, would be a two man job or require excavating equipment to do properly. Also it ought to be a fresh grave since people might notice that a headstone marked "RIP john doe, 1900-1965" has been freshly dug at. This also fools cadaver dogs since a cadaver dog alerting on a fresh grave is pretty much to be expected. 

The SHIVA STAR Project utilizing ultra-high energy capacitors experimented with this and eventually became the top-secret MARAUDER program and ceased reporting results. What you describe is actually a high energy plasma toroid weapon. Once the plasma toroid (ball lightning) impacts something it explodes violently releasing immense heat and a burst of x-rays and to a lesser degree gamma radiation and other electromagnetic effects capable of frying electronics. Its not very effecient in atmosphere though, plasma blooming means you need monumental power levels to project the plasma toroid even a short distance before atmospheric bloom causes the toroid to lose coherency. It would be an excellent space weapon though. Heres a link: $URL$ Heres a photo of the capacitor bank they used in SHIVA STAR prior to going top secret: 

A Peculiar Sort of Cape The character wears a sort of rigger's harness under his clothing with a large billowing cape-like garment attached to it. Instead of fabric the cape is thousands of sturdy threads. While thread seems weak, if enough of them are spreading out his body weight over a large enough area no single thread would need to be bearing much more than a few ounces of weight. It would also look mad-creepy. If his abilities are focused and fine-tuned enough (its magic so he can be as in control as you want him to be) he could even have them arrayed behind him in such way that they look like a massive blurred and droning set of flies wings. 

The refugees are going the wrong way. A high latitude ocean voyage on homemade balsa rafts or dugout canoes is suicide. You need real oceangoing vessels for that. There is a "right way" around the world and a "wrong way". Sailing west is relatively easy, and experienced sailors do this for recreation on modern ocean worthy sailboats all the time. Sailing east is definitely the wrong way, though, as you end up in the high latitudes to gain favorable currents and winds, but then you face frequent foul weather, which is a non-trivial problem if you don't have very capable boats. Disregarding the kinds of sea conditions your refugees will face in a higher latitude ocean crossing counts as "handwaving" in my opinion. We are not talking here about the refugees just getting splashed with a little spray on occasion, but rather about their makeshift boats being totally swamped by walls of water, being rolled completely over, and being flipped end over end, or just being smashed into splinters. Assuming the boat survives this kind of abuse (big assumption with a balsa raft), everyone and everything not tied down is gone. I am not kidding about that "tied down" part. Nobody will be able to just "hold on" while a medium-sized hill of cold water rolls across the boat, and that raises another point: Water in the high latitudes has a different, heavy quality from low latitude water. The water quite literally feels more dense when those waves hit you and your boat. A high latitude ocean passage without properly constructed vessels and skilled sailors is suicide. Even if you are going to gunkhole up the coast to Kamchatka and island hop across the Aleutians, waiting for fair weather for each leg, there are still places where you will have to make deep water passages, and it is almost never nice sailing weather in that area anyway. 

The key problem with building a backyard nuclear power plant is getting sufficient quantities of fissile material of sufficient purity to easily achieve criticality with a crude reactor design. Naturally occurring deposits of fissile materials burn themselves out fairly early in a planet's lifetime, so by the time 4+ billion years has passed, all that is left is the stuff that takes quite a bit of processing to burn, and it is safe to say that processing of natural ores in their current state into nuclear fuel is something that is well outside the capabilities of even the most industrious and precocious teen. But OP did not specify that this planet was Earth. If we assume his world is a geologically much younger planet (about 2 billion years old, give or take a few hundred million), then it is conceivable that naturally occurring deposits of fissionables are still lying about that can be purified by simple chemical processes that any child can accomplish. For example, she could crush the ores with a hammer or some other means, wash the crushed ore in acid to put the fissionables into solution, filter out the crud from her solution, and then raise the pH of the solution with lye to make the fissionables precipitate out. If she is starting with high enough grade ores to begin with, then this should be all that is needed to get nuclear fuel that can achieve criticality. Then our young atomic engineer needs an atomic pile, and that can just be a pile... as in a pile of dirt. Run some plumbing through the pile to extract heat to drive whatever heat engine she chooses, and some other plumbing through which she can maneuver moderators/neutron sinks to regulate the power output by pushing them through the pile to where her fuel is buried. She might also want to bury some thermocouples and maybe other detectors in near the fuel to get an idea what is going on while she is shuffling her makeshift control rods about. The resulting nuclear power plant would be crude, and the chances of prompt criticality accidents sterilizing the entire neighborhood would be ludicrously high, but this is a young planet, which means the inhabitants are colonists from someplace else as the only things which would have had a chance to evolve there yet would be things like algae and bacteria. This leaves open the possibility of a fairly low population density (very, VERY large backyards), and thus relatively limited concern over what the neighbor does on their side of the hedge. If your nearest neighbor is a few miles away and they are not downwind, then what do they care if you mess up and make a glowing crater behind your house? 

It could be cultural, for example many potential fields of research today are held back by very strongly ingrained cultural morals that view fields like bio-engineering as making a mockery of God's creation. Perhaps your colonists environment isn't to blame, instead they could simply view approaching technological equivalence with their ancient gods to be blasphemy. Its not too much of a stretch, in feudal japan match-lock muskets and large bore cannon, and even weaponized rocketry had been adopted and developed at one point, yet when the European traders and explorers arrived they discovered a medieval society wielding swords, spears, and bows. The ruling class saw fire-arms as a challenge to their honor and power. The feudal system based on a divinely granted superiority and right to rule didn't make sense once even a poorly trained peasant with even a crude firearm could easily kill even the highest born and expensively equipped and trained samurai, so they simply banned all firearms. Their culture actually remained in a state of relative technological stasis for several centuries because of cultural reasons related to their rulers forbidding any technological advancements that altered the status quo. 

Ships ought to have their own power source Gathering power from the engines of the ship are a better bet than either of those options. It is entirely dependent upon engine type, a link to just about every engine type ever thought up with the basics of how they work is included here. $URL$ Now one thing pretty much any engine does in generate heat, so a sterling engine is a possible low-tech method to extract usable energy from the ships propulsion method. A sterling engine uses heat to cause a pressure differential between two parts of a cylinder which drives a piston. Pretty much any sort of waste heat can be used, and nuclear fission or fusion driven propulsion systems will be generating a very large amount of waste heat to use. A molten sodium reactor could also be used, you can use the neutrons generated by a fusion engine to ignite a fission reaction in a secondary reactor which possesses a sub critical mass. This means that the regular nuclear reactor is only capable of operating when the fusion reaction is also running so you have a minimal risk of meltdown. Instead of clunky control rods and giant graphite and cobalt bricks you use the less volatile and more easily controlled fusion reaction to moderate your fission reactor. The molten sodium is used to turn a turbine before it is ejected in fine droplets from the craft to cool before being collected at the aft end of the ship by a collector vane. On the surface of a planetoid the molten sodium can simply be re-circulated through normal radiators after being allowed to cool off a bit.
