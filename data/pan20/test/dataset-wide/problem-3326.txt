But other tonal languages can and do have more than one tone with a flat contour / steady pitch. Basically just "different notes". Also other languages can have for example two contrasting falling tones with one starting high and falling to the mid range, and another starting in the mid range and falling to a low pitch. My question is, what are the most distinguished tones in a single language which have a similar shape but different pitch? 

In English "bow" and "bough" are two spellings with a single pronunciation In English and are two pronunciations with a single spelling "bow". 

So how is it similar and how is it not quite the same? I realize that Arabic pronunciation varies a lot from country to country, is the Georgian sound closer to the sound in any particular variety of Arabic or does it have some quality that keeps it always apart? 

In just about every language, the word for "tea" can be traced to one of two variants of the same word. , from the Amoy tê of Fujian Province and Taiwan. Cha, from the Cantonese chàh of Guangzhou (Canton). 

I'm an armchair linguist. By this I mean it's been an absorbing hobby for decades by reading books and online and playing with many languages. But I've never taken any course or other kind of formal training. So I'm lacking knowledge of things which are best learned in a formal setting or which require special equipment. I am now interested in knowing exactly where on the cartesian vowel chart each of the vowel phones of my personal idiolect occur. I have learned that they don't always seem to be the same as those conventionally indicated by IPA symbols in broad transcriptions. I'm a speaker of Australian English but I'm not even sure my vowels match General Australian. We don't really have dialects here but there are some regional differences, sociolects, generational differences, and a couple of mergers and splits that some have and some do not. On top of that I've spent much of the past 25 years travelling or surrounded by foreigners. Since vowels are more or less relative rather than having a set of features as with consonants, there seems to be more room for making incorrect assumptions about where one's own phones are located in regards to height and backness. (Obviously rounding is a bit easier.) What methods are used to self-analyse vowels? I'm interested both in traditional methods and technological ones, especially if I only need a PC and free software. 

One of the few discussions of this sound's nature I can find is a blog post from 2009 on the Clint Eastwood Movie Gran Torino, which featured Hmong characters. This blogger also seemed to have some trouble analysing this sound. 

Lao is so closely related to Thai that they are apparently mostly mutually comprehensible. Yet one of the first things I noticed in the speech when I crossed the border from Thailand to Laos is the complete lack of such particles in Lao. I never hear anybody say them and none of the materials I've seen on Lao describe them. In Thai it's one of the first things you are taught. 

I believe my variety of English, General Australian, has "dark l", but I'm not sure. I can't tell if I have it in my own idiolect or not. It's pretty well accepted (I think) that it's hard to linguistically analyse your own speech. In this case it could be tricky because in English dark l is an allophone of normal l (so it never contrasts directly as with a minimal pair). Also I've largely lost my accent because of years of overseas travel and working with overseas travellers when I'm at home - so if I used to have it I'm still unsure whether I have it now. So are there some methods or tricks a person can use to analyse their own various sounds, something like minimal pairs perhaps (I don't think there are exact minimal pairs). How can a person analyse their own speech for presence of the "dark l" sound? 

Yes of course! The linguistic theory of recursion is about syntax, within the sentence. It places no limits on what can happen among many sentences - discourse. 

There are some small pockets in India where people actually speak Sanskrit as a native language. From Wikipedia: 

I just now discovered that Wikipedia has an article "Topic marker". While that article currently makes no mention of Mayan or Austronesian languages, it devotes an entire section to Classical Chinese. 

They both begin with a labial, have an "e-like" vowel, and end "n". I think it's pretty established that the "b", "m", and "p" sounds can be variants of each other in variants of the same word or in closely related words. The vowel in is an but as fpr the vowel in I'm not sure if it's more like or , but I also believe that both of these can have close relationships with an sound in a language. The Isan language, generally considered a dialect of Lao spoken in Thailand with a different set of recent influences and now written in the Thai script, also has the two copulae: 

A borrowing or loanword is when a word from language A is added to the lexicon of language B, with whatever phonological adaptations are necessary. But is a cognate only a word directly inherited from an ancestor language, or is it correct to say that any two words than can be traced back to a common ancestor word are cognates? Obviously in the history of a word both things can happen: 

Your question doesn't specify whether you are interested just in nouns or also in pronouns or adjectives. In Spanish these forms of the possessive/genitive adjectives/pronouns (terminology depends on analysis/tradition) are inflected for number, and some also for gender, to agree with the possessed rather than with the possessor: 

Which terms can be used to refer to these out of "prefix" and "particle"? I haven't asked which is "correct" because I don't know if that's meaningful. But if it is that's fine, otherwise whichever is used by linguists. I suspect that other than these Japanese might not actually have prefixes, which might be reason to not analyse these as such either. 

I had long believed there was such a thing as a "set phrase". I thought I had learned it in my school days. Set phrases included but were not restricted to idioms. Idioms were a special class of set phrases whose overall meaning is not transparently based on the sum of its parts, such as red herring and to kick the bucket. Other set phrases were transparently based on their parts but still tended to occur as fixed units. Perhaps like at this point in time (but there may be better examples). However the Wikipedia article on set phrases has always been very poor, which makes me wonder if the concept I learned may not be as widely held as I thought: 

Have there been any studies done on say Mandarin native speakers who learn as adults other languages which have more lexical tones or which have lexical tones different to Mandarin? I believe for instance that Mandarin has fewer or simpler tones than Cantonese, Thai, and Vietnamese. Do we know if such second language learners typically have ease or difficulty acquiring these extra lexical tones compared to a learner whose native language entirely lacks lexical tone? 

The Georgian script has the resources to have three cases, since it has three distinct complete sets of glyphs to cover the same single set of sounds. Yet in practice Georgian is almost always unicameral and only occasionally bicameral. 

Most languages with vowel harmony seem to have two main divisions of vowels plus a neutral division. The main division is along one vowel dimension such as frontness/backness or +/- ATR (advanced tongue root). These are the divisions I'm referring to with "strong" in scare quotes. The neutral category is a different type because neutral vowels can mix with vowels of any "strong" category, so I'm not concerned with these. I'm interested to know if there exist any languages where each non-neutral vowel in a word must be a member of one and the same category out of three. I'd also be interested to hear about languages with more than three "strong categories". 

I know Chinese is related to some quite different languages like Tibetan and Burmese, the latter of which is native outside the territories which might be thought of as "Chinese language territories". I know there are a good few languages within China which belong to unrelated families, such as Uyghur and Zhuang. I know there are languages in nearby countries which superficially share features such as tonality, lack of inflection, and tendency to prefer single-syllable words. But then I began to wonder if there are any members of the Sinitic family itself which are native to anywhere beyond the borders of these "Chinese language countries". For the purposes of this question I'm not asking about the obviously vast diaspora of speakers of Chinese languages all over the world. A language solely outside these lands would be the most interesting but languages that span both sides of any border are also worth knowing about. I wasn't really thinking of any pidgins or creoles but I suppose those might be within the scope of my question... 

Is there a term in linguistics for such pairs? Are there terms for the type on the left vs the type on the right of each pair? Also, I'm not sure if other pairs would fall into the same category or not. Such as: 

Easy to Learn: By being free of regularities and using roots and morphemes already common among languages. Politically neutral: By not being the language of a single people, place, religion, or viewpoint. Peace and international understanding between people with different regional and/or national languages: By giving them an alternative language to use that all of them know and none of them own. Thus no language barrier. Thus understanding. Thus (hopefully) peace. 

Yes: "The sky is blue." I just described something. Only in much more limited ways than might seem to be intuitive. For an introduction to this area you could start with the Wikipedia article on Linguistic relativity, the famous "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis". No natural language satisfies your precondition of having a finite set of words (until they become dead languages). But even a hypothetical language with a very small vocabulary would have no limit on combination of words. There are surely many of these. Many dictionaries develop them to help prevent circular definitions among other things. The "Simple English" edition of Wikipedia is based on such a premise. 

Hmong is a dialect continuum spoken across several countries in Southeast Asia. One prominent characteristic is the "aspirated m" (IPA or ) found in some varieties. This is the reason behind the "hm" in the English spelling of their ethnonym. It's not hard to find sources stating that it exists, some like to include "voiceless" as well as "aspirated" when referring to it. But I can't seem to find a clear description of its nature. I know there are other languages with voiceless nasals, I believe some Celtic languages are examples. But I believe those do not also have the aspiration component. 

IPA just provides a set of letters and diacritics with descriptions of what sounds they represent. It doesn't provide rules for how these must be used for any particular language. Hence you will find for many languages, including English and Mandarin Chinese, that many sources will use the IPA a bit differently. The English Wiktionary doesn't yet provide IPA for this term but I'm requesting it. In the meantime, by piecing together pieces of other entries there I'd say the current editors working on Chinese would render it into IPA this way: 

After a couple of weeks in Thailand and learning how to say "I don't want it" I've just realized the word for "want" is very similar to the word for "want" in Mandarin Chinese. I know the coincidence rate is likely to be high in single syllable words but the fact the languages are so close in proximity and the large Chinese influence throughout the region still makes me wonder if it could be an old borrowing.
