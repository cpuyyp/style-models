Not for a very long time Energy is not a good form of currency because it is everywhere and it is very easy to get more. Aluminum used to be more valuable than gold, now it's used as foil and thrown out by the ton. Its abundance has made it nearly worthless (compared to gold). In order for energy to have significant value, it would need to be very scarce, especially since a kilocalorie is not much energy at all. Energy may be a currency if a society survives until the Heat Death of the universe. In the far far far future energy in the universe will become very scarce. The expanding universe will rob the universe of energy and what remains will be spread so far and thin as to be essentially nonexistent. In this time there will be no stars that shine, nor radioactive elements to derive energy from. The only source of energy will come from the Hawking Radiation from supermassive black holes. Their energy will be the most valuable thing left in the cold dark universe because without it nothing could occur and thuse its value preiceless. 

So, basing these calculations on the dietary guidelines released by the US department of health for 2015-2020, and the x630 mass factor given by @Nex Terren in their comment, these are the recommended daily allowances for a giant: 

So our giant will be eating a whole lot, to say the least. For reference, an entire cow, properly butchered, yields approximately 513,713 calories. That would be a suitable entr√©e for our giant, with a side salad of an entire lettuce patch. 

As @Schwern points out in their answer, the power output of your laser is high enough to pierce just about any armor, no matter how shiny it is. But, for the sake of fiction and with a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief... Black paint. Throw it on the knight's shiny armor, shiny armor is no longer so shiny, armor absorbs all the energy from the laser, laser either cuts through armor and knight instantly (the realistic option) or cooks knight in their armor within a second (the comedic option). 

Nothing to it Since time is your ally, make like Genghis Khan whom apparently .5% of the human population is directly descended from. Instructions for spreading you seed across the earth: Step 1: Conquer a region of the earth. Eliminate competing gene pool, which should occur during the conquering. The Mongols only conquered 12 million square miles, and they slaughtered those that opposed them. Step 2: Get very busy and enjoy the spoils of victory. Step 3: Repeat as necessary. Use army of wolves to keep your many wives from killing you. Exponential growth will do the rest. Keep tabs on your daughters to avoid inbreeding Step 4: Encourage widespread immigration of descendants to maintain healthy genetic diversity. Unless you mean literally spreading your seed across the earth 

The Hubble Deep Feild is not a picture in the normal sense, it was a very long exposure ~140 hours total. In intergalactic space, you would probably see only a night sky that was mostly dark with hazy "stars" or patches that are actually galaxies. Possibly the shine of a supernova. 

"a species has the psychological effects of alcohol"??? Question is somewhat unclear. Do you mean a species of which every individual, all the time, experiences the symptoms that humans get from alcohol intoxication? How can you even measure that? Human alcohol intoxication effents are only defined by Deviation from how unintoxicated human Brains work. A species whose Brains are inherently wired in such a way that they can never function better than humans at the alcohol Level you mentioned, would be somewhat less likely to survive or have evolved. Or, the other way, a species that somehow(?) has effects of alcohol, would have evolved to inherently, by how their Brains are wired, have superhuman concentration, Inhibition, reasoning, depth perception, what have you, so they would always compensate and have competitive abilities like humans 

Third Person doctor/helper is a non-biological Person (Robot), or a sapient non-mammal, or a human with a very serious blood bourne infection, or some blood toxicity Thing. All very good reasons not to use their own blood 

Spoiler: They don't last long. Now here is where the history of this planet diverges from our own. This impact forms two moons. One of which becomes just like our moon, because it's very important. The other does its own thing for a while and is much smaller and identical in composition. If you want a planet like Earth (oxygen, life, really okay place to live), it needs to have a history similar to the earth. It took the earth ~4.1 billion years before it got to conditions close to today, and ~4.6 billion years to get to humans. Note My source doesn't start the time at the formation, but ~700 million years later. Which means that this planet needs to get to get its rings sometime after 4 billion years has passed because the rings themselves may last only a few hundred million years. This is where that second moon comes in, say ~4.4-ish billion years after the planet formed. Thanks to gravitational interactions it has finally spiraled in too close to the earth and reaches its Roche Limit and breaks up. For a body like a moon that's a distance of about 10,000 km above the surface of the earth, half as high as GPS satellites. This is really bad. Shortly after the initial breakup, parts of the moon will rain down on the earth. One mountain sized rock probably wiped out the dinosaurs, there may be thousands of them raining down. In all likely hood, this will sterilize the planet and you will get a world not too different from Venus with rings. Because that answer is boring, let's examine the case where the Hard Rain is relatively mild and life finds a way to thrive afterward. The planet This planet will be quite different from the earth. The area under the rings will be an exclusion zone because the material will continue to fall to the earth for millions of years. Expect lots of craters and volcanism due to damage to the tectonic plates. Impact damage may be less severe due to rocks falling in at only orbital speeds ~8 km/s rather than the usual 20-30 km/s. The shoreline will also be a no-go zone because of tsunamis caused by impacts to the oceans, tides will be unaffected by the rings because they are distributed across the planet. The sky may be constantly hazy due to a much higher frequency of impacts. Heat from the reentry and dust may contribute to extreme weather by providing extra energy and condensation points for water droplets.The atmosphere may cause cancer, the dust causing Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Overall expect the planet to be cooler due to the dust, the light blocked by the rings will have less of an effect in comparison. Magma movement will not be affected. There will also be more UV radiation from the reentries of the rings. Possibly Less of a night because of light bouncing off the rings and the dust halo around the earth. And probably a whole lot more which will be added as I think of it. 

Assuming everything else in your timeline is the same with the only difference being who won the American war of independence, the founding fathers would likely be cast as a group of rowdy drunks with no loyalty or social obligation. The biggest reason for the revolutionary war was the fact that the British were imposing taxes upon the colonies without allowing them representation in parliament, so this refusal to pay taxes would be used to paint them as greedy and arrogant. After 1833, they may also be called hypocrites for their talk of freedom and equality while nearly every one of the American founding fathers owned slaves. Benjamin Franklin in particular would be painted as a debauched, manipulative, whoremonger due to his proclivity towards long trips to France on which he would routinely copulate with as many women of the night as possible. He was also known to enjoy drinking, which any propagandist would spin along with the whoremongering to paint a picture of an old lecher who wanted a country to be his playground. George Washington would likely be shown as a pansy who only got his rank in the military through nepotism, more concerned with the profits of his plantation than the people of the country he was forming. He may also be shown as a spoiled child who didn't think of the consequences of starting a revolution before doing so due to his close relationship with his mother. Thomas Jefferson would probably be painted as a stuffy academic who never worked a day in his life. They'd probably call him a drunk too for good measure. 

Never For one thing, to my knowledge, no veins of Iron have ever been found in volcanic breccia so large deposits of steel (iron) found in one would immediately be suspicious. Additionally, cars are made up of many materials that over such a short time would not decompose. More surprising would be finding the concentrations of aluminum and platinum, let alone the plastic and glass. It would never be mistaken for a vein of iron. Edit: When I say vein of iron, I really mean Red Bed which are deposits where you find iron in the form of oxides. 

Climate Depends on several things, if we are sticking with the Earth-Sun system then the Earth will get much hotter since it will receive more the solar energy than it gets now. Probably pretty bad for the majority of life on earth but Antarctica could be a nice place to live at least. Now, this is assuming nothing is done to alter the Earth. If we are talking moving planets then altering the atmosphere is easy. Removing the greenhouse gasses is one step that could preserve the earth because without them the earth would be very cold. With a faster rotation expect winds to be very different, again hard to say directly but expect them to be moving faster. The Coriolis Effect will play a much larger part in the weather than it does here on earth. A combination of more winds and higher temp extremes probably will cause superstorms. Probably still habitable, just much hotter. For example the solar system inner limit may be as low as .5 AU. 

Human Breasts. Because it is very implausible for a newborn whose spine is curved in the way that a centaur's must be, and who can't possibly have more developed Motor skills than that prime example of mammalian precocialness that is a horse foal, to bend down /curl around to reach the udder. Assuming the centaur Baby is the same size in relation to the mother, as a horse foal, the Standing offspring would not quite reach the nipples at birth and either require the mother to kneel, or use a Kind of step stool. And then they would be tall enough to comfortably reach the breast after a few weeks, and would know when to wean when they grow so tall they would have to bend down... again with the spine Also, suckling from the upper Body is just cuddly and nice and allows for eye contact and hugs, so I feel that would be more appropriate for a species that has both eyes in front and participates in somewhat human-like social interactions (If that's what you're going for). 

You can get Creative Burn them by super compressing the air around them which can cause a huge spike in temperature. It's the same principal that a fire piston uses. Turn them into Red Mist by creating a cavity in the air then releasing it. The atmosphere will rush back into place at the speed of sound creating a local shockwave. This is similar to how a Depth Charge works. Focused Shockwaves consisting of a slug of air moving at multiples of the local Mach number would be deadly. Note: This is not a gust of wind or a shockwave that an explosion could produce. Air Jet Cutter, like a Water Jet Cutter use a filament-thin stream of high-pressure air to slice through your targets, add dust and stand for good measure. Ice crystals formed by the rapidly expanding (cooling air) could work as an abrasive too. The air in the stream would have so much energy in it that it would blast through you. Electrocution by rubbing together to opposing streams of air and building up a massive static charge, not unlike lightning.
