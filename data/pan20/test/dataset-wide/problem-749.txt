Best solution (probably available only at shops): use an air compressor with a narrow tip to inject air between the grip and the handlebar at an angle (like spiralling around). This will create an air cushion and you can move the grip around (keep moving the air jet as you apply the air jet, since only in some positions the air cushion is formed). Less professional method is what I use to do at home: 

Push from the bottom (lateral part) of the grip, so as to "fatten" it in a barrel shape. This increases its inner diameter, allowing it to snap into position. Pull from the inner border, like you would pull a sock around your foot, preferrably with both hands. 

You got it right from the start: when I went over the bike to ride, and after some minor adjustments (none of them at the extreme of adjustment range), I felt the bike almost exactely like the previous one, except for a slightly long reach, which I still don't know is due to too much saddle setback or too long stem. Nothing to be too much concerned, since I rode at most 2km and the immediate feeling was very soothing and familiar compared to the previous 56cm bike. About other characteristics you mentioned, there is no overlap (plenty of clearance, actually, which is good for randonneuring with fenders), BB height was fine (quite nice fixed-gear cornering), pannier clearance is yet better (44cm chainstays instead of the vanilla 42cm of my other utility bikes, good for fenders in the rear, too), and the steering balance is stable without being too slow or hard to quick-dodge. 

How much difference, you asked. When I started to ride skinny tires, I noticed the far places, the ones I took too long to reach, became very close and I could get there fast with way less effort. It's like distance and time were distorted to my favor, like StarWars time travel. The downside, as already said: it seems like you spent too much time fighting boxe with padded protections, then suddenly you are bare-hands and bare-face, flying at 35+ mph around treacherous obstacles you can no longer ignore, balancing over a twitchier, harsher handlebar where brake levers are not reachable all the time. Anyway, it's impressive how much abuse a 23mm tire can endure if the rims are solid. After the novelty passes, though, one ends up knowing, respecting and admiring strengths and weaknesses of either bike type, also being able to assemble, if wanted, a whole colorful range of possible hybrid setups, or even using either type of bike outside its expected primary application. Hope this helps! 

I would use GPS for wilder trips, and a combination of online services and paper roadmaps for more civilized trips. Both ways of doing it generate some dependency and some indepencence: 

The final result is ugly, I know, but it works incredibly well with no issues so far. And the helmet (the only one I have) is itself a beater. Now regarding SAFETY, when I take a look at the picture you posted, and considering my current experience, I think: 

The suspension wears out while it works, due to friction; The suspension, when locked, suffers from impacts and vibration, both of which mechanically stress the whole structure, and specially the lockout mechanism. 

As for the consequences, I would say that the main problem would be to adjust the rear axle too tight, as this would cause excessive mechanical stress on the drivetrain, or to assemble it so loose that it falls off. Except if you ride fixed or coaster brake (when the lag while pedalling backwards would become a bit annoying), there is not much problem in letting it a bit more on the loose side (enough not to reach an overtight position). Also, if you use good quality chains and replace the chain often, the rest of the drivetrain tends to "age well" while wearing, because the teeth tend to "even out" in the process. But if you use crappy chains, even good quality gears will suffer a lot more... Hope this helps! 

I guess I could say there is no need to much more than this, but of course, what fits me could not fit you. And, as a matter of fact, the more you ride, the less you worry about communication, because the team learns from each other each time more. 

EDIT: due to the confusion that arose between crossing vs. radial (which wasn't what I meant) and different ways to lace the same crossing pattern (what I intend actually), I made a drawing (out of scale) showing the two possibilities. At left, the "physically touching crossing". Please note that in the frontal view (bottom left) the spokes are not actually twisted against one another like the view might induce to think, but are only flexing against one another). 

From your question, it's uncertain if you are performing the tests with the bike stopped (pedaling backwards) or moving (coasting). If the squeaking happens when you coast, it could be something in the freewheel, or due to the relative movement between the cogset and the wheel, but I have the impression this is not the case. Now if the noise appears when you pedal backwards (but not when you coast), and you re-checked pulleys and drivetrain lubing, it could be because your derailer have lateral play, and it changes its angle depending on which direction you spin the pedals. Just for the sake of completeness, there are some hubs (American Classic, for example), where the freewheel is attached directly to the axle, while usually the cassette is attached to the wheel, which in turn is attached to the axle. I'm saying that because this would be the only situation where it would make a difference if you coast or if you pedal backwards, since there would be no relative movement between cogset and axle while coasting, only while pedaling backwards. In the regular, more common situation, it wouldn't matter with respect to freewheel, only with respect to chain movement. Of course it's hard to deduce what the problem is only by this description (it is in the flesh, already), but I hope this helps, and please add feedback when you figure it out! 

Most probably rust and/or old grease inside the cassette. I would try spraying WD40 into the freewheel, waiting overnight, and trying to "break it free" the other day. But there could be other problems, like the ones Daniel Hicks cited. It would be fine to add more detail to your question. Hope it helps. 

About using a flap, I am ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that it is very very welcome and extremely useful. Some designs are more flexible, and that work better, but yours is fine, specially if you manage to get the whole mudguard lower than this. I use to say that I'd rather ride without all the rest of the mudguard than without the flap, because it is the actual responsible for a clean and long-lasting chain, and not-so-wet feet. Hope this helps 

I agree with jm2 about the "mental state" thing. I commute daily with more than one bicycle, and some days are just TERRIBLE, seems like I'm dying each pedal stroke. Other days I fly like an eagle zigzagging in traffic like I was 20 again (I'm 34 by now). And I have a "golden rule" regarding bike fit: once I find it during one typicl ride, I NEVER change it (except maybe saddle height), unless I need to replace some broken thing. But my additional theory would be: try to act upon your body, not the bike. For sure as we get old the body changes. When younger, I liked the ultra-sporty condition, with handlebar almost five inches below seat, and it was ok. Now I complain because the handlebar in one of the bikes is ONLY one inch ABOVE the seat, and I cannot rise it further! What I realized, over the years, is that you need to get your body in shape. I was a student until 24 years old, then I was always riding the bike with no worries, no job responsibilities, and no household chores. Then your mind is always free and you never feel pain. As you get old, joints get stiffer, recovering time increases, sometimes we sit in front of the computer for 10 hours a day straight, traffic is not that calm anymore, etc., etc. We end up needing more comfort, more "support" from the bike. If you are having the trouble you described, I think you would benefit heavily from a physical enhancement program, be it with a physical therapist or with a personal trainer, focusing on improving flexibility and range of motion mostly, but also muscular tone and perhaps cardio fitness. Pilates, Yoga, and such, are what I would try first. I've done Pilates myself, only once a week, and heartily recommend it. And don't forget, riding a bike will always be an effort to the body. Sometimes it's useful to have a bolder attitude and "attack" the bike with your muscles (more postural tone, more power, more bloodflow) than to be "attacked" by it (letting the body be shaken and compressed by gravity, road surface, contact points, and such.) From the Rule N.6: "Free your mind and the legs will follow". (and, if you want the aggressive viewpoint too, take Rule N. 5...)
