By June, 1940, the French army had been divided into three roughly equal parts. 1) One third was lost (captured) in the north when the Germans reached the English Channel south of Dunkirk (nearly all the British and Belgians but only a few French were evacuated), one third on the Maginot Line, and only a bit more than one third on the Weygand Line. After winning in the north, the Germans concentrated most of their army, (including some opposite the Maginot Line), against the Weygand Line, giving them a nearly two to one superiority in numbers and weapons. It's true that the outnumbered, outgunned French fought bravely and initially held back the Germans in "most" places. The problem was while they were "seldom" defeated on the Weygand Line, they "never" won. For instance, they could not quash any of the three bridgeheads the Germans had pushed across the Somme. Finally Rommel found an opening, pushed through, and won. Given the German superiority of numbers, one or two breakthroughs was sufficient to collapse the whole line. I remember a ping-pong game I played as a child. Each point lasted 15-20 rounds. Overmatched by an older player, I seldom lost a point but never won. The final score was 21-0, after nearly 400 rounds. That's what happened to the Weygand Line. 

There were actually TWO endings to the War of 1812. The first, and "official" ending, was the signing of the peace Treaty of Ghent, December 24, 1814, which would have made a nice Christmas present. It called for a cessation of hostilities, the exchange of lands and prisoners, and the appointment of a joint commission to study U.S. Canadian boundary issues. The ACTUAL ending of the war was the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815 (news traveled slowly in those days, so neither side knew that the war had ended). It was a complete, lopsided victory for the defending American forces, under General Andrew Jackson that helped catapult him to the Presidency. The British suffered some 2000 casualties (one fourth of their total), including the commanding general Edward Pakenham. This battle was regarded as "sealing the peace." Even the "Iron Duke" of Wellington didn't want to fight the Americans after this. 

Three groups were placed in the social hierarchy in descending order based on their relation to the basic needs of life. 

"Train" in this context, means a series of events, in this case, "abuses and usurpations" as cited in the passage of another answerer. A common 18th century usage of "train" was "wagon train," as in a group of wagons pulled by horse that carried food and other supplies for an army. It was only in the 19th century, after the invention of steam engines and locomotives, that "train" referred to motor vehicles traveling on "rail roads," that is "roads" constructed of rails specifically designed to carry such vehicles. 

Up to the battle of Taierzhuang, the Japanese government hoped for a "limited" war in China, in which they would occupy the Shanghai-Nanjing and the Beijing-Tientsin corridors near the coast, and make peace, or at least a cease-fire in place with China, and prepare for war against stronger countries like the Soviet Union and the United States. In essence, it was a "declare victory and go home strategy." This hope was defeated by two forces: 1) the Japanese army, and 2) the Chinese, both of whom were "out for blood." The Chinese had defeated the Japanese at Taierzhuang by using superior numbers in confined spaces, and the Japanese army wanted revenge. The Japanese cabinet had three choices: 1) pull out, which was totally unacceptable; 2) a negotiated peace, now made infeasible; and 3) all out war. Although the last was now the only real option, the Japanese Cabinet went through considerable anxiety in deciding to pursue it. Source: The OP's Taierzhuang link. 

Basically, the Ottomans were "Turks" first, and Moslems second. Hence, they felt no need to cater to their Arab subjects by adopting one of their cities as a capital in a way that the Mongols might have felt with say, the Chinese. Even today, "Turkey" is not really part of the "Arab" world, even though they are both Moslem peoples. Besides its political implications (e.g. as the "second Rome"), Constantinople was an ideal capital for the Ottoman Empire. That's because it had aspirations to the north, as well as the south. The fact that the Arabs had been conquered earlier was "incidental;" again, unlike the Mongols, the Ottomans were not headed in a primarily southerly direction. The Ottomans had interests in the Balkans, and also took the Crimean Khanate under its wing, thereby involving itself in "Russian" politics until the twentieth century. Also, Constantinople guarded one of the three key "straits (the Dardanelles) in the Mediterranean. The other two were the Strait of Gibraltar (outside Ottoman domains) and the Suez Canal (not built until the late 19th century). Apart from Constantinople's strategic location, it was easy to defend, largely protected by water (as the British found out at Gallipoli in 1915), and accessible by land only through narrow corridors. 

Gibraltar is much closer to home, and much more important to Britain than Hong Kong. Gibraltar is literally the gateway to the Mediterranean, all of southern Europe, and large parts of Africa and the Middle East. Hong Kong has nowhere a comparable level of strategic significance, at least to Britain, because it is halfway around the world. Gibraltar is also much easier to defend. Besides shorter lines of communications, Britain is much stronger than Spain (similar populations, but Britain is much better armed) and much weaker than China (which has a much greater population, and is similarly armed). 

To take off on another answer about the Crimean war, the use of swords (by cavalry) is documented in Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem about the Charge of the Light Brigade ("sabering the gunners there"). It was a late example of sending soldiers with blade weapons against soldiers with "fire" weapons that became infamous for the disproportionate losses suffered by the British cavalry. Shortly after that, "repeating" rifles and artillery made such charges altogether impractical. Thereafter, cavalry was used only as a form a transportation, with cavalrymen dismounting and using fire weapons such as rifles. One quarter of the men had to hold the horses of the other three quarters, so this disadvantage had to be balanced against the faster arrival. 

Turkey and Russia were in each other's way. And Armenia was caught between both of them. Russia started around Moscow in the late 15th century, and spent the next four or five centuries expanding south. The Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 and spent the next three centuries expanding north. By the 18th century, Russia occupied Crimea and formerly Turkish held lands on the north shore of the Black Sea. That gave it naval access to modern Bulgaria and Romania, which Turkey considered its sphere of influence. More to the point, Russia's Black Sea holdings were a dagger pointed at the heart of the Turkish heartland, with Armenia being Turkey's "chest." Russia wanted a warm water port, and the primary path would have been through the "Straits." A second means to a warm water port would be through Armenia (which was divided between Russia and Turkey at the time), "Kurdistan" (divided between Turkey, Syria and Iraq), and ultimately Syria, which is why the Russians are involved in Syria to this day. Armenia (at least in Russian hands) was an existential threat to Turkey, now based in Ankara. Which is why when the Armenians tilted towards Russia, the Turks hated them. 

Put another way, your question is "where is the tolerance for the protesters of the 1960s?" Because Robert E. Lee was still a "patriot" compared to Jane Fonda (at least Lee wasn't aligned with a "foreign" country). So why is Lee being banned while Fonda is still honored? That question was answered in the book "Generations" by William Strauss and Neil Howe. The issue is that we're in something like the modern 1930s, in a so-called "crisis" era, in the shadow of the 2008 stock market crash (the modern 1929), and 9/11 (the "modern Pearl Harbor") and ISIS. These are times when the ethos is "circle the wagons." and "let's get rid of what doesn't belong." The intolerance of Robert E. Lee (a past bugaboo) is part of the pattern. According to the book, an era like the 1960s occurs about every 80 years or so, historically in the 1880s, prospectively in the 2040s. This is a very different kind of time, an era of peace and prosperity, like that enjoyed after World War II, when people care more about the less fortunate and fight harder against "injustice" real or perceived. The "civil rights" generation was the so-called Silent generation of Jane Fonda (born 1937 during the Depression, came of age in prosperity). The modern Silent Generation is the Homeland Security generation, born in the 2000s and 2010s, after "9/11" who will produce and support the new "Jane Fonda's," around 2040. 

India might have faced civil war, during the 1947 partition. It was largely through the efforts of Gandhi and other peace seekers that it didn't happen. The influence of Gandhi and other advocates of non-violence helps explain the lack of coups or dictatorships. Basically, "strong men" were not a fixture of Indian society as they were in others. 

Japan had a five year non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union (which the Soviets broke in 1945 after four years). Attacking Russian shipping would have been an act of war, and Japan didn't really want or need a "third" enemy. Japan feared that the Americans would use Soviet territory to launch air strikes or "stage" an invasion if it provoked Russia sufficiently. In this instance, therefore, Japan was content to "let sleeping dogs lie." The country did have the consolation that the materials would not be used against her (at least until the 1945 "double cross.") Yes, Japan was allied with Germany, but only against England and the U.S., the two maritime powers that Japan truly feared (and were capable of invading Japan). The book "Marching Orders" and other sources show that Japan urged Germany to make peace with the Soviet Union so they could concentrate "two on two." 

Although it was (technically) addressed to Americans, Rudyard Kipling published perhaps the best reconciliation of these two impulses with this poem, "Take up the white man's burden". Key lines include the following:
