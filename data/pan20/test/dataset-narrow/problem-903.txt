all of the ports are visible even the ones which no longer show! - a little more information would be all other queues are setup with HP Drivers, but this one is a Xerox 7755 using the correct driver. If I create new ports printing resumes as normal. Has anyone else come across behaviour like this? Why are you using custom ports? This is because printing is being monitored by a print auditing software package which has its own ports. Only this one print queue has this issue, all others work as they should do. Many thanks for looking at this question. Cheers Update Event logs show nothing related or worth while mentioning. The server has been powered off and then backup. The time between the last occurance of the ports disapearing has been about 2 months. All ideas are welcomed! 

I think for remote working RDP is a fantasic tool. If you look at newish MS technology like TSRemoteApp it uses RDP. I think you will find it very difficult to migrate away from RDP whilst keeping costs down. You could look at moving into Citrix enviroments but would the cost be worth it? With the purpose of helping you find a solution how else would you suggest remote workers access systems in the office? 

Once this has been done look for lines which contain :25 if any exist the application is correct and we need to look more closly at the software running on the box. If not the software is not accurate. EDIT Now you have checked and found a line showing port 25 is infact open on your machine, we need to see what that process is. 

When you say you have installed the OS, and used the same settings as the old server, does this mean that you have joined the server to existing domain at Site 1? When you say you can access Active Directory can you see all of the users and computers you would expect? My thought so far is: the reason your users cannot login when the new server is connected is that it is not a Global Catalog server, and as a result wont authenticate users. Please see the Microsoft KB article I have linked below: $URL$ You will need to check your DHCP settings, you are looking for the DNS servers and default gateway, the DNS server IP should point to your server and your default gateway to your sites router. Once you have confirmed that DHCP is pointing your client PC's at your server for DNS you need to ensure that you have your DNS forwarders setup correctly. I tend to use googles public DNS servers for forwarding 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 If you need me to expand on the DHCP or DNS settings or where to find them let me know and I will update this answer. I think this is enough to go on with at the moment. 

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are after but www.servage.net offer stupid ammounts of space for about Â£50 per year. it may be worth a look. The offer almost unlimited bandwidth I seem to remember also! 

you would need to use $URL$ to access it. You will need to ensure that port 80 is open on the Firewall before attempting to connect. 

If your internet connection comes with a usage limit then no matter how you proxy/tunnel your still going to be using bandwidth and hit your limit. 

Sign up to a service which provides either outgoing mail scanning / a service which allows you to use a dedicated SMTP server to deliver your mail. 

Any idea's would be great EDIT: Please see my comment below - I appreciate my question could have been misleading I know that best practice is to use a static IP. The alternative is to use a DHCP range printing direct to hostname. The KB - KB967363 resolves my issue - thank you to those who tried to help. 

The DHCP server is setup to enable DNS dynamic updates and is set to always dynamically update A and PTR records. 

this is quite subjective but wouldnt setting up an FTP server suit your needs better? Possibly try FileZilla Server. If you are hosting files also then apache wouldnt be a bad choice for you. 

To answer your questions yes you can do what you propose. I would however if possible swap to enterprise for your PDC but at the end of the day it shouldnt matter to much for you. 

You need to look at your DNS server, and create a CNAME. The following URL should give you some more information on what is required and the purpose of a CNAME. MICROSOFT KB I can provide more indept instructions if required. 

A simple solution could be to install ultravnc and use the option to disable user input. You could also use the F11 key to make the window full screen. hope this helps. 

No - if you require a machine which can handle multiple remote RDP connections you need to purchase a server Operating System combined with Terminal services with the correct ammount of licenses for users. Any attempt to hack/slash your Windows XP machine is not recomended for obvious reasons, not to mention as Sergey said you will have violated your License agreement with Microsoft. 

Please see my question, I think I had the same initial issues as you where on 2008 DNS Changes to DHCP assigned hosts were not seen/updated. The commented KB fixed this issue. 

My initial thoughts would be that the computer you are trying to access the network with has lost its relationship to the server - rejoin it to the domain (log on as local admin) How many users? How many computers? All users effected? Any services not working? Server does have valid network connectivity to the rest of the machines? What's changed recently? These questions will help us resolve the problem :) 

how many people have authorised access to your FTP server? If its only a few I would apply a firewall rule to only allow the authorised user's external IP address. I think the most obviously solution is the block the IP address and maybe log an abuse ticket at the idiot's ISP. You can check the ISP of the user using the ripe database: $URL$ use the search box on the right. Hope this helps you! 

What kind of server is it? Microsoft, Linux? If we are talking Exchange then yes there is a way, which is simple to use! Let me know! 

I assume from what you are saying that Cougar is your Windows 7 computer. If so the problem you have lies with the changes in security with Windows 7+. You will need to ensure that the windows 7 firewall is configured to allow "File and Print Sharing". You will also need to ensure that you set the folders you wish to share access to are configured correctly both on the share and the NTFS tab. Do both of your computers belong to the same workgroup? Another issue could be Windows 7 provides device discovery, using the "Networking and Sharing Center" you should check to see if device discovery is enabled. Also when connecting your windows 7 machine to the network for the first time you will of been presented with a box asking you to identify the type of network connection which is active. This of course should be set to Home. I have give you a basis to start troubleshooting, please let me know how you get on. 

Is the server a 2003 sbs server or a standard/enterprise? The first thing you need to do is make sure migrating your hardware will conform with Microsoft licensing requirements. You need to check if your OS is OEM or Retail, if its OEM it dies with the hardware if its retail you should be ok. Is this server a domain controller? You will need to check the folder structure and the standard that was setup when the server was brought into action. If you can let me know the answers to the above I can edit my answer with a solution for you. 

There are many services which do this another being - $URL$ - I think for the features you require its going to cost a little bit. 

I'm not 100% but is this a new user? It could be a problem with the default user profile, maybe worth a look even if it is a stab in the dark! It may also be worth granting the user elevated priviledges to move the Quick Launch bar! Sorry if its not an acceptable answer, just and idea! 

What kind of server is it? (Windows/Unix?) Is it remotly hosted? What applications is it running? Are you using stupid passwords? Are you using a Firewall? Noway near enough information to even begin to help you! 

In my opinion, this question could be asked as how long is a piece of string? Obviously when you hit 100% CPU use everything else is going to suffer. Personally I investigate when my server's CPU remain above 50%. Your graph shows bursts not even as high at 50% so I think your server is in good condition, you would need to take note of how many websites are running and/if any DB's are running and the sizes of them. There are alot of factors which could effect your server, but I think CPU usage isnt one for you at the moment. 

It is a SBS server, it is designed to do all of the above. I have seen many servers where customers have skimped on the spec but they still run perfectly fine! If you are looking to remove and disable features you may aswell rip off the SBS os and install 2003/2008 Standard. ****Please note if the SBS server does not have all the FSMO roles it WILL shutdown frequently and be very unhelpfull!!***** I would look at what is eating the CPU and RAM, it makes sense to check that first and go from there. It would also be worth while checking the C: drive to see how much space is remaining. You could always attempt on offline filesystem defrag 

Is Mailbox Management setup to run? Has it ever run? Do you have Archieves setup for your users? (AutoArchive?) Have you run an offline defrag of your Exchange database? What is your deleted items retention set at? 

I assume this is a DLINK router, and your using cable internet connection? Can you ping the router? you may find you need to power down the modem if it is cable at the mains then power back on whilst the nic is connected to the router. 

Try www.mxtoolbox.com it has a simple blacklist checker which should be able to detect any blacklists that your on! What are you settings in hmail for outgoing email? 

Unless you have changed the ports the web servers run on you cannot, by default they both run on Port 80. Head into IIS and change the binding to port 81 instead of 80. This will allow apache to run, whilst attempting to access website via IIS they will need to end with :81 Hope this helps. 

How many domain controllers do you have and how many sites do you have? If several sites what are the link speeds like? 

This command lists all running tasks on your computer and with the "find" pipeline it can limit the results to the process ID you showed me in your comment. Bear in mind! One thing you need to bear in mind is that your server unless it is on a DMZ/Connectect directly to the internet or has a NAT port forward on your Firewall/Router is invisible to the internet. Dave on the comment of your post has the right idea to test this. If you attempt this from home or any network with access to the internet which isnt your own. Open a command prompt and type the below: 

Any printers which drivers are not installed on the terminal server will not loop back. I'm not sure of a way to choose which printers are mapped! Sorry! 

You will now need to open an additional mailbox in Outlook you can do this by going into account properties in Outlook opening the existing users account, going into option and adding the additional mailbox in there. Let me know if you need anything else. 

To the best of my knowledge there is no way to achieve what you require through active directory. You may be able to look in your servers DNS to find both the IP's and Hostnames to export to a spreadsheet or other format. You could also use an IP scanner such as angryIP scanner. Hope this helps. 

Rather than give up and change your windows network to a Linux network becuase your nearly reaching the database limit. (thats how i took your question I appologies if i'm wrong) I wonder how much research you have done into see why your nearing the database limit? I think for only 50 users to be using nearly 75GB of data, your either doing something wrong or users are sending/recieving massive emails whilst keeping them in their mailbox! 

I have a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 print server. This is serving about 15 print queues the problem is just one of these queues is randomly losing its printer ports. What do i mean by losing the ports? A printer is setup with custom ports, printing works perfect until randomly printing stops and errors. Then under the printer properties on the ports tab, the custom created ports are no longer showing. If i jump into the registry and look under the key: 

You dont need to setup parking or the like, simply ensure you have paid for the domain name and check the expiry date, provided you keep paying for the domain you will keep it.You will not lose your domain because there is not hosting assigned to it. Hope this helps! 

Due to the nature of my work (Software Printing Solutions) I tend to work with Microsoft based servers to host printer queues and settings. I am finding it more and more common as we gain new contracts for some systems to be running Linux based systems (always a different variant of Linux) The question is what is a simple distrubution which I can test creating print queues on and how would i share them out so both Windows and Linux based machines could connect to them? It would be helpfull to know both the command line based commands aswell as how to do it through a GUI if one is available. As always your answers are always appreciated. 

EDIT I see you have found point and print. The way to enable point and print is to obtain the ADM files and import them onto your server. EDIT 2 Have you tried the below from one of your links? I have just tested it on my test network successfully. You have to set the GPO for Point and Print restrictions and Deploy the printers to the users using Group Policy . This will get rid of that admin prompt for non-admins when installing printers on Windows 7. $URL$ 

3 - The hostname is changed on the printer and rebooted, but neither DHCP or DNS update with the new hostname. 

memory.dmp is a dump log from a previous crash. It can be safely deleted unless it needs to be debugged. Should your machine crash again it will recreate it! 

The first thing that comes to mind would be, how is what is the logging mode set as on your database? If you change it to simple it should reduce the size of this. This link may help: $URL$ 

As the title states I am looking for information regarding building a public DNS server. I have a Windows Server 2008R2 box, the beast has internet access and the relevant DNS ports open. The plan is to build a public DNS server which will be locked down apart from certain external IP address. I know that public DNS servers can be setup with BIND however I'm wondering if this can be accomplished using the DNS server role in server 2008? Just to ensure I'm getting my questions across in the way Iâm trying to! I want to create a public DNS server similar to Googles 8.8.8.8 DNS server, but I would like to accomplish this in Windows Server 2008! I would very much appreciate if someone can either give me a definitive NO! Or offer me some help in order to complete this project. Many thanks in advance for any assistance. James 

If you get a banner page make a note of what message you are displayed as this will help us identify which server is setup to recieve port 25 from your Firewall/Router. Please Note this answer is being updated as more information is being provided 

You would be able to perform the above using a router and NAT. If you require more information let me know. We would need to know what router you have and what services on the network you need to access.
