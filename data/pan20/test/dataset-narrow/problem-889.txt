In the Ironport web administration page, under Network/Certificates, you can define the various certificates you wish to use for SMTPS and HTTPS. When defining a new certificate, you can upload the (last step) PKCS#12 certificate. After this, you can edit the existing certificate via the same page. At the bottom of the page is a collapsed section "Internediate Certificates (optional)". Open this, and it will allow you to upload as many internediate certificates as are necessary to complete the chain. Now you can assosciate this certificate with your HTTPS service on the Ironport, and it wil send the full certificate chain. We do this here using QuoVadis certs which require 3 intermediate certificates, and it works. 

RRDTool (as of version 1.4) does not allow you to have different scales on the Y-axis above and below. What it does allow you to do is to create a secondary Y-axis with a scale shift argument. Items are still plotted according to the primary Y axis, though, so you need to perform any necessary calculations yourself. The necessary parameter is --right-axis. $URL$ 

When you change any custom ruby code, such as a custom function, you must restart the Puppetmaster. If you are running puppet under passenger, this means restarting Apache. Otherwise, you'll get the old version. In addition, there is a rather nasty bug that kicks in if you are hosting multiple environments in your puppetmaster with an identically named function in the other environment. In this case, you have no way to be sure which environment's function is used when you call the function name! It uses the same function namespace across all environments... (this is confirmed to happen in Puppet 2.7.22, not sure about 3.x) 

Note this is for a single user; you may want to have different options if you use a master user/password, or if you require SSL for the connections. Then call it with something like: 

Dovecot doesn't know where to put the mail, because you have set the maildir to be but you have not told it what the user's home directory is. Try something like this, which sets the as well as : 

If you use the Routers2 frontend for MRTG/RRD, then it comes with the ability to make a 4hour graph, if you are collecting data at 1min intervals. At standard resolution, 4h is the graph width with 1pixel per data point. You can enable this in the routers2.conf file. 

The command only retrieves data from the raw RRA; if you do not have an RRA of the requested granularity, then the nearest available will be used, but no additional calculations will be performed. Add a new RRA to your RRD file when you create your RRD file, with a 1cdp==5pdp rule. EG 

The cause of this turns out to be that when files are deleted from the ext4 filesystem living in the zram0 device, the memory is not freed back to the system. This means that, although the space is available for the filesystem to use (the output of ) it is nevertheless still allocated memory ( the stats in ). As a result, the memory usage heads up to 100% of allocation, though the filesystem still finds itself half-full due to deletions. This does mean that you can still fill the filesystem and new files will not use as much new memory space; however it does affect the compression ratio negatively. The solution is to mount the filesystem with the and options. The releases freed filespace back to the memory device and as a result the usage on the two matches again. 

It is not Dovecot recreating the Trash folder; it is your mail client (Outlook in this case). Some mail clients, when first setting up the definition, will probe the mail server to identify folders with the special use flags such as \Junk, and will then use these flagged folders for the special purpose. Others, such as Outlook, will just go ahead and do things their own way, and will create a folder with the name that they want to use regardless. What you can do, is to use the plugin to make both names valid. See here for an example, which makes both "Sent" and "Sent Items" equivalent: $URL$ 

This configuration looks correct, provided your Puppet agent is running on a host in the 192.168.1.x subnet. The deny is coming from , since your is allowing all the resources. It would seem that your puppet agent is not connecting form an IP in this range -- try adding to the [files] section temporarily to confirm this. If your puppet agent host is multihomed, check which interface it is sending from. Also check the permissions and ownership on the fileserver.conf is correct. 

Then restart Sympa. This will ensure Sympa uses the correct domain name, even if the hostname and DNS have been changed. 

Check your nagios.log and see if it is showing that NSCA has submitted commands, but for the wrong hostname/servicename Make sure NSCA has write permission to the Nagios command pipe file Make sure nagios.cfg specifies that external commands are processed Make sure Nagios has a reasonable command processing interval in nagios.cfg Check that NSCA is configured to accept commands from the remote sender - if you use Xinetd for NSCA then this will be in the file, and if you run NSCA as a daemon you should look in your file. Check your local host firewall to make sure it is not dropping the inbound NSCA connections. 

Then, completely remove the definition from Thunderbird, and recreate it. Thunderbird will re-probe the IMAP, and will autosubscribe to the folders. 

This filesystem is used by our application for rapidly accessing large amounts of ephemeral data. The filesystem size displayed in matches the zram size as reported in Copying test data into an empty filesystem, we verified that a 2.2 : 1 compression ratio is achieved, and so the filesystem fills before we hit the zramfs memory limit. The value matches the usage reported by the filesystem: 

Check your definition. You almost certainly do not have the autosubscribe option set, or else you added it later after Thunderbird had already probed the server. Make sure you have the option set on the relevant folders: 

to the Apache configuration (default for this setting is 131072). I have not been able to verify this fixes the issue but there is anecdotal evidence to indicate that it does. 

I think that, for some reason, your Sympa installation thinks the hostname is now whereas previously it was . As a result, emails coming in to are passing through the alias file only to be rejected as having an invalid domain. In your , explicitly set the host domain: 

You can read the disk queue on a Windows server by using the or agents. These agents are intended for use with Nagios; however they can also be queried by MRTG. You can use the plugin for MRTG that is distributed with the Routers2 frontend. This queries using the NSClient protocol and can access any of the Windows PerfMon counters, which includes the value you require. The plugin has a compilable C version and a native Perl version; the C version is better if you can compile it. To define a MRTG Target using this, have a definition of the form: 

The Apache webserver is unable to run the script because it is unable to find an interpreter to use. This means that it does not recognise as a compiled binary, and so is treating it as a script, and therefore wants the first line to be for some interpreter. Since you claim the script is a compiled binary, but Apache does not recognise it as such, it is likely compiled for the wrong architecture. Try the command to see what type of file your OS claims it to be. Possibly it is compiled for 64bit when you're running a 32bit system, or it is a Windows executable when you're running a Linux server. In any case, you need to find a compatible binary for it to work. Try running the script directly form the command line, to verify that it can execute, before running via Apache.
