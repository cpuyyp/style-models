I think you have a lot of misguided thoughts here. First... Winscp uses native ssh to copy files. It does nothing different than the linux command . There is no way scp will work... when winscp does not. winscp is a windows interface that uses a basic scp client to connect to a ssh server to copy files. Second... In Linux-based OSes, there is no concept of a "C drive". You have the root (/) and directories under root. A block device is mounted to root, and various other block devices can be mounted to directories that fall under root. The syntax for "scp" is as follows: 

Honestly, my knowledge of permissions in Chrome is a bit... lacking. This sounds like something that should be done in your firewall... and not at a workstation level. In most firewall appliances, it's fairly easy to block certain mime-types & such on-the-fly and white-list some sites. The advantage to this approach is that even if a user switches to IE, Opera, Firefox or whatever else to access whatever annoying flash site... they're still unable to get there. 

I honestly cannot say what it is... 29178 isn't a standard port for anything I know of. As it's the system process that's listening on that port... I suspect you may have a bug on your machine... or perhaps whatever program you are trying to setup is already running... and the windows-firewall is blocking connections to it. 

Welcome to the wonderful world of swap-files. OSX like Windows uses actual files in the file system to extend the base-ram of the system. Essentially, bits of RAM that aren't currently being used can be temporarily written to disk and then re-read back into RAM on-demand. Your disk-based thumb-drive probably does not have enough space to accommodate the swap-files. (and storing swap files on flash... is a very bad idea.) You can disable the swap-file usage, but doing so would require that you have sufficient RAM to load everything your computer runs without it. You can read more information here: $URL$ 

as far as locating what is where... a large portion of that is using the command which is part of the slocate package iirc. to build a database of where files are (which is usually run regularly as a cron job) and to actually find it. If you're simply looking for where an executable is hiding... just use to give you the exact path it's running from. As far as what is commonly put where... most flavors of linux have their own mind on this subject. Wikipedia has a good article on this subject... that is a good place to start. 

SoA record - this record says you are the "Start of Authority" for this domain. NS record - this record says what server is used to resolve names for this domain A record - this is the actual record used to associate a name with an IP. 

Previous versions aren't really eating up space. It uses free-space to backup previous versions of the files sure... but if you fill the drive with files... the previous versions get automatically deleted. When performing a backup, the previous versions are not being backed up with the current version. Previous versions are a feature of the "Volume Shadow Copy" service that implements a copy-on-write architecture for windows, which when a file/directory is changed, a copy of the previous state is stored on the disk for recovery... (if needed) If you fill up the disk... the "archived" versions are auto-magically removed... to make room for REAL files. Unfortunately, you cannot move previous-versions store to another disk. You can, however, enable it or disable it per-volume. You can disable previous versions entirely... but this will not help your backup situation. At the end of the day... The previous versions are not included in the backup-process. 100gb of data backed up 10 times still takes up 1tb. (ish) 

UFR II is the 2nd version of UFR... which stands for "Ultra Fast Renderer". In short... it's similar to PCL in concept... but alien in the actual instructions. Most commonly associated with Canon printers. PCL is more generic, common, and simple, but antiquated... UFR II is better designed, and faster, but not anywhere near as common. If you have a printer and driver that both are geared towards UFR II... use it. If not... PCL is a lot more forgiving. 

You are not understanding the TTL field on DNS queries. The TTL is an indicator for the client how long it should cache the results before re-querying the nameserver again. Unless you update your DNS server with a different value for the TTL, the response will always be the same. It is very bad practice to re-query nameservers every-time you need to resolve a hostname to an IP. 

The only issue I'm aware of is the battle between the NTLoader and Grub. In order to boot something other than Windows, you must use Grub (or syslinux or lilo or some other customizeable boot loader), but the Windows boot loader doesn't play nice with any of them... and is not capable of booting into Linux. You can install grub with full dual-booting capabilities, and it will boot into Windows8... but there is no guarantee that Windows 8 won't overwrite the MBR and break everything. There are a few reasons why win8 decides to re-write the MBR... and most aren't obvious. 

A private network... is basically a network inside of one building... controlled entirely by one entity. Think of "private" in the same context as "private-property". A virtual private network means it may have several private networks that appear to be the same network that may be connected together through some sort of tunnel through a much larger network (the internet?). People attached to any place in the private network can talk directly to any other attached device in that private network... even if 1/2 of the network is located across the country only connected a tunnel to the other side. 

To the best of my knowledge... Photoshop doesn't anti-alias most things. (I believe font layers are... but that's another subject) I believe you're referring to "feathered edges" or are working with "semi-transparent areas". You either need to remove the alpha-channel from the layer... (meaning no transparency) or be sure not to use tools that select/create soft-edges or have a feathered edge. 

Yes. NTFS is not optimized for a linux-style environment. Additionally, the file-system is proprietary Microsoft, and closed-source... and Microsoft reserves the right to change their file-system at anytime without notice. Most implementations in Linux rely on largely reverse-engineered information and limited information gleaned directly from Microsoft on how to correctly implement it. Many of the optimizations in Windows under Linux are also disabled simply because of a lack of support or understanding on how to correctly implement them. With that in mind, there's always a change of a random bit of code writing bad bits of data to the volume causing irrevocable damage to the file-system. This is very similar to efforts of making ext2 file-systems available in Windows. At best it is risky. I would honestly suggest making use of the EXT2 in Windows option over the NTFS in linux, simply because EXT2 is very well documented, and supported. 

This isn't really an easy thing to answer. We would need to know some details about your "sub-woofer" to be clear. Most 2.1 speaker sets (left/right + sub) typically do not have a separate channel, but rather the left and right data are processed together, and there is some electronics in the inside that splits off a from the audio source and then passes that to the sub-woofer. An easy way to tell is by looking at the plug(s) itself(themselves): 

The problem is that TeamSpeak (all versions) use a completely different audio codec and media transport than FreePBX (or asterisk, more specifically). You would need to do a lot more than "pipe audio between the two". You would need to transcode the audio in both directions, as well as create a bridge between the container formats. Creating such a plugin for Asterisk would be relatively simple... but TeamSpeak is proprietary, and trying to do such would violate many licenses, so I doubt you'll find anyone wanting to get into legal-hell trying to build this. 

The closest thing you could do... is make use of hibernation. Unfortunately, the operating systems are alien enough to each other that there is no way for both OS'es to be running at the same time without implementing virtualization. Honestly, virtualization isn't as bad as you think anymore... especially when you are using a virtualization platform that supports the "VT" extensions. The guest OSes get the ability to communicate directly with hardware, and have much better memory mapping & such. I've actually setup a guest OS installed directly on a SSD... and it ran faster than the host OS. 

for your formula. This will return true/false, which may not be what you want 100%... but it's the most efficient method. Alternatively, you can rely on the statement... to get exact results... like this: 

The best way I have found to do this... is to go down to the "contacts" tab... and use the "Search Contacts" box. The Address Book's Find feature is full of fail. 

It sounds like the physical device is either not physically installed... or is switched off... or is broken... or the driver you're trying to install does not match the hardware. 

Hit "Ok" and after that, you will no longer have the volume icon. You can reverse the process to re-enable it. 

This is a very generalized question... (more information would be useful...) as the Windows Firewall exists in different versions... and has different capabilities with each version... etc. (Assuming you're running windows 7, and you're ONLY wanting to use the windows-firewall) The short answer is: Sort-of. You can deny access to a IP address, which would in-turn deny access to any websites hosted on that IP address. This rule would apply to any application attempting to connect to that ip-address. (Windows 7 has the only windows-firewall that blocks outbound connections) The only fly in that ointment, is that most companies of any large scale have many IP addresses all of which serve pages for that website. yes you can block them all, but it's really an excessive amount of work. (If you don't mind getting your hands dirty) you can also modify the hosts file (c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts) and put a bogus entry in there for the domain in question, but a lot of anti-virus with some level of heuristics will identify this as some sort of suspicious activity, and others will silently wipe out any changes you make. The third option is to invest in a router that has some sort of content-filtering options... (there's quite a few out there that work quite well that aren't too expensive) or look at software like netnanny or other solutions like OpenDNS to provide whatever level of filtering you require. 

Ok... you've just given me a long list of conflicting stories that make you sound like a paranoid non-geek... who is trying to understand things without bothering to do research on the subject. 

Although... if you're messing around with DNS names frequently, you might want to simply edit the hosts file and make your changes as needed... and when ready to migrate to production... make the final changes on the DNS server once. 

I'm not 100% sure, but perhaps you're having issues downloading the javascript or CSS for the site. Sometimes (for big companies) the CSS & javascript are stored on a 3rd party "CDN" (content delivery network)... which frequently end up on "ad-blocking" lists by accident. Have you tried disabling ad-blocking software? Perhaps you have some nasty-bug on your machine... and it's redirecting web-traffic. 

Yes, but unfortunately, Windows will probably give you no shortage of fits. more than likely, the HAL between your old dell & new dell has changed, such-that windows won't boot without a re-install. On the flip side, you can do one of those repair-installs of xp and might be able to repair it after cloning the disk over. Linux on the other hand... rarely has a problem. 

Try tmux. Once a session is created... you can attach to the session from multiple computers and detach from it keeping the shell active until you re-attach to it. 

Honestly, a replacement Ethernet adapter is far cheaper than any usb host-to-host adapter I've ever seen. But you also said that both "buying a gadget" and "requiring a bit of proprietary software" were something to be avoided. Even USB Ethernet adapters are cheap. The best part is... it's 100% non-proprietary... and very well documented on how to make it work. 

Honestly, I prefer using mxtoolbox.com for doing mail-server testing. It can verify a great-deal more than any command-line tool I've ever seen. Also, some additional information about the error you are getting would be useful. 

Most of the time when I run into that... it's because the codec used to encode the video isn't compatible with the player. Just because the computer can play it... doesn't mean the TV knows how to decode it. 

There are a few reasons why your disk would be checked every time at boot. Usually this is because the disk has errors, and you have yet to fix them. Boot-time scans cannot always fix errors, and will just report that human-intervention is required. It is also possible to set a flag on the volume to scan every time. Check ... specifically the flag. Setting the "fsck.mode=force" as a kernel boot option can force a check every boot... perhaps someone/something updated the boot options. I have seen where the "forcefsck" file in the root is re-created by a process running on the machine, but this is more of a "slight-possibility" than a likely. 

Short Answer: Don't use scratched/damaged media. Long Answer with more details: During boot, Windows has not yet switched to a multi-threaded environment. If any one piece decides to not run asynchronous, the entire boot-process will stall until either A) the process completes or B) windows decides to kill the process. In the case of a CD-Rom drive... it is treated as a device like any-other with a driver, and when that driver is loaded, the first thing it does is query what's in the drive. Unfortunately, this is not an asynchronous process. The CD-ROM drive waits for the drive to return some information about what's inside blocking all other execution of code during the boot-process. Luckily, Windows doesn't get to kill it (or you would end up with a BSOD), but rather the driver has some spiffy logistics in it to stop asking what is in the drive after some period of time. (not exactly sure what that time is) Once windows has finished booting, it switches to a multi-threaded environment which is why the CD-ROM doesn't lock up the whole machine while waiting for the results to come back. Additionally... prior to the actual "Windows Boot" your BIOS may have some sort of firmware-recovery that can try & access your CD-ROM which is also not running in a multi-threaded environment and suffers from the same "wait for the drive to say something" type problems. 

Let me answer your question, with more questions... First, How do you want windows to recognize it? A "5.1" device is merely seen as 6 audio-out channels. Second, How do you know it's not working as designed? When playing music or whatever that is 2-channels (common stereo which most things you play on your computer are)... it only picks 2 of the 6-channels to play on. (typically the front left/right) Yes, you can probably change the channels that are the "primary output"... but the result is the same. There are different software applications that will attempt to virtualize the 2-channels of audio into 6-streams appropriate for a front/back/left/right/center/sub setup... like winamp... and also various DVD/blue-ray playback applications. And there are applications that can read an actual 6-channel source, and playback directly to 6-channels in windows. Most (if not all) of the latter example require special licensing from THX or Dolby to decode their special codecs that contain all 6 channels. Some of the software packages out there come in a standard version (without the special codec) and a premium version (with) that will have some additional configuration options that let you assign the channels properly to your sound-system. There is no perfect solution (for windows at least) that will take a 2-channel audio source, and map it to your 5.1 configuration. Windows (by-itself) is only capable of mapping 1 channel to 1 channel. 

Define "safe". Tinfoil-hat safe? no. State police safe? absolutely. Federal-safe? mostly. NSA-safe? probably not. Honestly, if you're seriously worried... nothin' some thermite won't fix. 

MySQL permissions were probably not restored. The fact that you can log into the server without any permissions suggests that you need to set the root password, and add any other users that need to be used with their respective permissions. 

Long list of issues could potentially be wrong. A bad video card maybe... but you would still hear the first "beep" indicating that the BIOS has performed it's POST and everything seems ok. You would also hear the hard-drive ticking as it's booting... and possibly the startup sounds of Windows (assuming you're running Windows or whatever startup sounds) If you don't hear the initial beep (from the BIOS's POST) ... it's very likely something is very wrong with something on the motherboard itself and/or the power-supply. More information would be helpful... (what caused the "last" restart... user-choice? programs crashing? BSOD? ???) Do you hear the "POST" beep? Does the hard drive sound like it's booting your OS? What else have you checked?
