As mentioned "locking" C to a read only state wouldn't really work since applications (besides the system itself) will try to write to it and fail. If your only concern is Windows Updates - simply change the settings as above. 

After doing a Ctrl + Alt + Del - you will find the Power Options in the bottom right corner (under Windows 7). From there you can hybernate 

Windows, by default, will do incremental Backups with the exception that if you let Windows choose how to go about it, it will (if the needed storage space is available) include a system image. To avoid this behaviour:► Choose Setup Backup and select your destination drive - Next► Select Let Me Choose and Uncheck "Include a System Image"It can be argued about how exactly backups should be done "the right way".To add a little subjectivety: Storage is cheap so in my case i create a System Image roughly every Quarter with weekly Incrementals for specific Directories. 

The command top will generally show you the information given in the Activity Monitor ordered by the processes using the most resources (like CPU-Time). For more information on the top and ps commands prepend "man" eg; man top. 

How it came about: On a Windows 7 Pro 32-Bit Machine. I was running an incremental backup covering the usual user specific data and a couple of manually selected directories (nothing special: no system directories) with the standard windows backup and restore function. At roughly 50% of the operation my system froze up not reacting in any way holding that state for about 5 minutes followed by a self-induced reset. Since this reset: The SSD [PNY XR8 120GB / 4 weeks old] is no longer being recognized by the BIOS. What i have tried: 

You're looking for Section Break. It will not allow you to insert some design or theme. For that i would write a little VB Macro to take care of this - see description here. The example given could be applied to every section break in a document. 

Is it possible to change mpg321 default devicetype to alsa so I do not have to keep using the -o option? i.e would just be able to type 

I am looking for an ARM RPM of PHP 4, specificity to install on Fedora 17, however I cant seem to find one anywhere. I assume this is most likely down to ARM not being supported by Fedora in the age of PHP4? Hopefully either you know where I can grab the RPM or maybe a way to compile from source or some other install method? Thank you and hopefully someone can help! (if you need more info just ask!) 

I am hoping someone can help as I refuse to believe something I can do in windows very easily can't be done in Linux. If you need any more info do let me know. Thanks 

Today I went to resize one of my drivers partitions as I am currently switching from Ubuntu to ArchLinux as my main OS. However when I go into Gparted I get the error "Cant have overlapping partitions". Checking Fdisk gives the below resolt: 

Looks like sda4 is overlapping with sda3. I know my partitions are a big of a mess, one of the reason I am moving from Ubuntu so I can remove the sda4 and 5 leaving just Windows (sad1+2) and arch linux (sda 3). So I guess my question is how to fix this overlapping. if possible by shirking sda4/5 so there is no longer a over lap? I would prefer to keep retain my data but everything is backed up so if there realy is no other option I could to a complete clean install... but why I am here is to see if there is anything way first. Thank you and if you need any more info let me know! 

Windows + 0 - 9: You can select an existing Taskbar Item and maximize. Windows + Shift + 0 - 9: You create a new tab / instance of the Program selected. Windows + Alt + 0 - 9: You open the Right-Click Menu for that Taskbar Item. Beyond that there is no way to change the order with KB-Shortcuts. 

That's a BIOS Code for Bad Memory. Remove single sticks to narrow it down or swap them all out if nothing works. 

The packetloss at your router will probably be an overloaded router dropping packets where normally an error packet would be generated. Try increasing the interval...see if there are changes. Beyond that the packet loss figures don't really mean anything to your connection with the destination ip. 

They are backward compatible. But - since each version brings new functionalities with it, only the basic function set is backward compatible all the way, see the table for more detail. In addition to that 2 devices wanting to communicate using bluetooth have to support the same profile(s), the full piece that i copy/pasted from here. 

In that case go to the Snapshot manager and create a clone of your defined snapshot. The VM has to be turned off - the clone will then be your base vhd including your snapshot file (which only documents changes to base vhd). 

TP-LINK TL-R470T+ is an inexpensive option with 3 additionally configurable ports (wan/lan) although i don't have any experience in the setup of this kind of thing TP-LINK has always been a stable and quiet cheap solution. Edit: Since your main concern is stability, i would refrain from trying to build little DIY-Solutions. The configuration is generally much broader/deeper than using a router with this kind of functionality. In addition to that, you don't really want to be troubleshooting 10 components when the system breaks... 

So my questions are: What can I do to get nm-applet running? Maybe it's running and I can't see it? Otherwise, what can I do to set it to connect to WiFi automatically? 

Okay, so I have an interesting setup going on. Far away from me, is a headless (no monitor) Ubuntu box hooked up to an ethernet cable. This computer is intended to be a public internet station at a hostel, it's just waitinig for me to finish the wifi configuration, and then the owner will put it in place, hook up a monitor, and that's it. The computer HAS a wireless card, which seems to work (i.e., I can give it commands through iwlist). 

Setting up a local update server (It was too complicated, and seemed like overkill). Installing with Windows Stand Alone Updater -- just didn't work. It stalled on "checking the updates installed on this computer" I tried updating Windows Defender - that too, stalls. I tried installing Windows Update Agent 3.0 (I think). The install succeeded, but the updates still don't happen. 

For starters, it's not a good idea to stick everything under /var/www and point the browser to $URL$ For one, it complicates things when you move to a new server later on. It's best to create a virtual host on your computer, by creating a new file called (your site name) under 

I'm at wit's end. I'm running Windows 7, and a few weeks back it just stopped installing updates. When I try to run Windows Update, it just stalls indefinitely until I cancel it. The Update History says the automatic updates failed with error I've tried the following: 

I've been using Excel to process data from a Sharepoint list for a while now. However, I recently added a column to the Sharepoint table, and when I refresh the data in Excel, I don't get the new column. I perform a lot of calculations based on this data, so creating a new worksheet with the "new" Sharepoint list, moving the calculations and the pivots to THAT sheet is more hassle than I'd like to face. Is there a way to force Excel to display this new column that I've added? Maybe by modifying the connection string? 

Standard: C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\ Fallback: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application 

The Problem lies in the fact that the WOL Function relies on an Ethernet Broadcast which solely goes by a MAC-Address (OSI Layer 2), not an IP (Layer 3). Trying to do this through a VPN-Connection will usually go wrong, with the following settings you can get around this: Setup Port-Forwarding in your Router with UDP Port 9 (WOL Layer 3 Pakets usually go by this port) on your local machine - don't forget to set static IP's since DHCP will jumble things up (eventually) also be careful, if you do have a dhcp range you want to keep alive, set static IP's outside this range. 

Take 8.8.8.8 as your secondary DNS Server. Adding multiple servers won't really give you more security in my opinion, google ALWAYS works (and has worked). 

If nothing in the boot process changes: Motherboard...?! At this point the question you have to ask yourself is wether or not it actually makes sense to spend hours (eventually days) tracking down the problem, or wether it's better to build/buy a new system...obviously depends on wether this is purely private and fun/hobby or if you really need to get some work done and don't need this. Replacing a not so new Aspire L320 shouldn't cost a lot (especially in comparison to the hours spent trying to fix it). By the way: Continue posting your results as you try solving this, someone might have had the exact component/problem and can add to the issue. 

Check that the CPU fan is spinning on startup Check if there is any/enough thermal paste between heat sink and CPU Remove the RAM Sticks and try booting with single sticks to see if it's a faulty stick Swap the PSU out for another... If all else fails, swapping the graphics card for another would be worth a try
