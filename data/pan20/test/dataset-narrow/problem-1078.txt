What is the orange ball on the wireless icon And why does it have no green ticks in the icon at the very bottom(with the orange ball on it). But it has green ticks in the popup for Network R8 (the one I am connected to)? 

Note Using a batch file to write this was silly.. Batch files are often not very portable because a slight change in the output of a command with a new version of the OS or a new version of a command, can make the program not work. And if it relies on third party programs where different versions of them are out there then it's not good. And many of gnuwin32's commands are out of date, cygwin tends to be more up to date with its versions of commands. This was running fine for me though now I tried it it gave an error. I might write something in C# instead at some point. Also note that as Rick pointed out, this doesn't take into account DLLs used by a program. Though personally I find what is useful to me is to know how much is used by the executable (or in the case of some modern browsers, the many instances of the executable!) 

And if you replace with it also works , in the above windows example. And you can replace with which is fine too for cygwin 

You can check to see if anything is listening on Port 53 your DNS port. I have seen some malware called PenWes that does this It appears in Programs and Features under Spyware & Virus blocker[116] It can be removed by ComboFix or Add/Remove Programs. Maybe ComboFix is better for removing it. 

Something to try- You can right click your network card under device manager, look for a power management tab that talks about turning off the device to save power. "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" and untick it since you have an issue also it's worth pointing out that under control panel - network connectinos, you can right click your LAN icon and click diagnose, whenever there is a problem. that can "fix" it quicker than restarting (I tend to set it to DHCP(the default) when doing that). 

this page $URL$ seems to suggest installing the visual c++ redistributable.. some say 2010, some say 2015. I don't know if I have it. I have Visual Studio 2013. I don't want to end up possibly downgrading what I might have, by installing the C++ redistributable 2010. And I don't want to perhaps get some incompatibility by installing a version like 2015 when I have VS 2013. I'm not even sure if version of C++ (e.g. 2010 , 2015) redistributable has any relationship with version of visual studio (2013 or 2015). 

63 see there are 63 in that file, the right number. that is all of them in that album. All 63 wget -i list.txt -w 3 $URL$ So that's all of them, all 163(100+63) of them, from the two albums. This is the line one would use to take a list of the JPGs listps2.txt is a file with all JPGs, both relevant ones and irrelevant ones. The relevant ones are in 72_p form, extract the relevant ones with grep. And change them with SED. put them in "thatfile", and you can then do wget -i thatfile -w 3. As I did. 

There is a blog that mentions it $URL$ But the blog gets lots of things wrong in its description. (See comments on your question, for some examples. But his description doesn't matter) You found the instructions mentioned on the blog worked, which was to extract the zip into the fonts folder in control panel and restart chrome. $URL$ 

if you do netstat -on or -aon then, the -o gets you a column for process id, and you can see in task manager which process is which. 

If I start the office 2013 installation, it looks like Visio is installed, yet I don't see it listed in the start menu 

The few i've used, when in bridge mode, have no web interface or IP. (maybe yours does) With those, you have to reset it(holding the reset pin) to get to the web interface and that takes it out of bridge mode. With yours, there may be other ways, but You can reset it too like that and get out of bridge mode and to a web interface. 

You need to investigate this more. Take the HP IPAQ PDA for example. There are many ways you can charge that. With a car charger. With a plug in the mains. With USB. If it is not charging, not flashing, then you should investigate it while it is acting up. Quickly switch it to a mains-plug charger. Do you find it ever act up with a plug charger? Regarding it not getting recognized. I often found that when plugging it in, it didn't get recognized. I bought a new cable and the new cable was very reliable.. It was a cable thing. But these things can be combinations of cable and usb port. If you have a really reliable cable then it can compensate sometimes. Like, unrelated to this, i've had a usb adaptor that works in some comps and not others. And another usb adaptor that works in all the comps. So, I conclude that it's both usb device and usb port come together to make an issue, each contributes to it. you can't do much about the usb port. And in your case, not much about the device. But you can about the cable! It is not uncommon for an HP IPAQ to not be recognized on USB, then people get a new cable and it is. Get a nice official looking cable if you can! And since they're cheap.. you can buy a few from a few people,and a shop.. Will they all have the same problem, then maybe not the cable. You could start with one cable.. it's definitely a good move. 

your problem is that dot is matching new line.. try unticking the 'dot matches newline' box. Which in notepad++ might not have hard to find(See the bottom left hand corner of notepad++'s edit..find dialog box). I won't include a picture because you didn't put notepad++ in your title and I think it's good if the answer isn't tainted to look too notepad++ centric, and unnecessarily notepad++ centric. Other programs that support regex, also have a dot matches newline thing that can be ticked or unticked. you could experiment with other searches and see if they work or don't.. some will work regardless of dot, e.g. if they don't use dot, or if they may have use dot but with eg which uses an operator so it doesn't match too much. Other regex examples require that dot matches new line is unticked. So may as well untick it, and only tick it to see what if any contrast. You can try this with dot matches new line not ticked. Or your one with it unticked. Or see what happens with this a kind of pattern of the form [^X]*X, (that is a good way of averting the problem of e.g. if you do .*x then the * will include x, and you don't want it to. So you can specify everything that is not x, *, followed by x), such as or try Note the caret within square brackets means Not. The ^ outside square brackets means match position at the beginning of the line. Another way is trying specifically eg will matches few dots as possible. So will match a few characters as possible up till X. 

What is "It" referring to. Does it mean, not even CPU, but the Computer System, in which case, yes, that's true. Does it mean CPU in the now unusual sense, of the box, a definition common in some books i've seen in the UK about 15 years ago. Yes that's true. So, CPU in the sense of the box.. Then Yes, that's true. But if "it" refers to processor, or CPU in the sense of processor, then no, that's not true. 

sed --version shows 4.2.1 and i've checked is gnuwin32's not cygwin's. This creates a file a.a with a quote in it 

You can find these out of range characters and decide what to do with them.. Some of them may be curly quotes. You might just want to replace those with straight quotes. But others will be your nuisance characters that notepad might not handle well and you'd want to delete. So for notepad++ a find of Note you'd click the replace tab so you can do find/replace.. 

The earlier sed (gnuwin32's sed), allows "s/\/_/" It's not escaping the forward slash. So the backslash is escaping the backslash to make a literal backslash. And the forward slash after the two backslashes, remains fine. And it works in that. note- running cygwin's sed in cmd is fine. And since it's a later version it's preferable to gnuwin32's sed. The later sed (cygwin's sed), does not allow "s/\/_/" because the / is escaping the forward slash. Instinct(and correct instinct) would be try adding another backslash and see what happens. And it works. Not sure the mechanics but I guess a single backslash in the later sed is . 

I am using Outlook 2010 - I have my emails showing in there. and exported my emails, into a csv file. (file..options..advanced...export..export to a file.. I have opened that csv file in excel Here is a list of the fields it shows. I see "Date" doesn't appear among them. 

I do have a network connection when I see this message. I don't get this problem when the file is local. 

I have circled the part that shows you Internet access. Ths is of course a clear improvement, and indeed I can then ping 8.8.8.8 or www.google.com do \ip I can click details in that window and see my iP there or in ipconfig. 

The following worked for me "I was able to resolve the issue by unselecting the option - "Fade or slide menus into view" under the following. Control Panel - System - Advanced - Performance - Settings - Visual effects " $URL$ 

I have just done it. Some obstacles could've been finding Dos Shell, or getting an incorrect ms-dos version error(which can happen when you mix and match), fortunately I found dos shell, and had no 'incorrect msdos version' error running it, and similarly you can do the same and get no error. I will explain how 

you could download sed with gnuwin32. This prepends the current directory. Doing %cd% doesn't work.. so converts every to , which results in . 

If you do or in e.g. windows 7, you see use of the term switch. e.g. copy /? describes "The switch /Y". windows uses the term switch for /X (or /XY or /X:Y), linux uses option and -x or --blah. There are one or two windows commands that can use hiphen/dash eg ping, and there, when it's hiphen, windows calls it an option as you see from looking at current microsoft documentation online whether for ping or for dir they refer to parameters, so each of those items be it /b for dir, or -n for ping, would be termed a parameter. 

yeah I think so. Or a process rather than an application. A process is an instance of an application in memory. And the port is one field of many fields within a packet(to use a general and useful definition of packet). When a process is said to listen on a particular port X, it means it is reading or being given packets that have port set to X Say you have two computers A and B B has a bunch of different pieces of software, different processes running each process on A and each process on B associates with ports.. And so when packets go to A or B, the processes know which packets are for them. In fact it's not just for each process.. It's for a communication channel.. So a process on A wants to exchange data with a process on B. So A picks a port for that communication, and B picks a port for that communication.. And A and B send packets to each other with the source and destination ports set correctly. If A and B want to communicate on another subject or a related subject, or the user on A or user on B want to.. Then they can use new ports. And so the programs on A and B or users on A and B , can see the two communication channels separately by looking at all packets where the source or destination port is X. As to your questions 

I suggest that you ask your ISP what router-modem they recommend, often they provide their own and they know which ones are most reliable. And if with that ISP and their recommended router-modem you still get errors, then change to another ISP, and when you change to another ISP, ask them which they recommend. It also helps with tech support if they are familiar with it, besides that they know which ones are reliable. It is very controversial to say this in the US techies who love their netgear.. But in the UK I've run into a number of people that won't touch s netgear. I've seen UK businesses often use Draytek e.g. Draytek Vigor.. My ISP don't use netgear they use some thompson speedtouch modem routers, which they've found incredibly reliable. Both your routers have been the same make, and netgear! Maybe Australia is like the UK and netgear aren't so hot here. If you really want to experiment then change both ISP and Router, and go for the router your ISP technicians recommend as reliable first. Pick an ISP that is highly regarded for reliability too. 

go here $URL$ scroll down to SED. Download coreutils too while you're at it. this command will replace a with b globally, and on each line. so not just the first occurrence on the line. e.g. using sed "s/a/b/g" a.txt 

Try experimenting by taking the PCB on and off cheap small capacity old drives Not necessarily swapping them.. Just taking it off and putting it on. See if they're still fine. If that works, then you've got a good chance of success. One issue can be if the firmware on the same model drive is different. But see what the people selling PCBs say.. and you'll get the right PCB. Do report back on identifying the right PCB if it goes beyond model number.. And if it worked or not. But I think with that plan, you have a great chance of success. 

You want the Dell Inspiron 1501 service manual (dell calls it the service manual). googling for dell inspiron 1501 service manual gives link $URL$ and in case Dell misbehave and change the link $URL$ dead old link $URL$ 

I just tried the link you mention, found the zip, extracted it, looked for a windows version, it looks like a cygwin thing. Perhaps unnecessary to use that link, since cygwin has curl built into it. Download cygwin. see at cygwin.com an install option links here $URL$ run that. And when you get this screen I suggest you click View until it says full(the view button is near the top of the image), then you'll see curl there like this, as you see in the image, they are in alphabetical order. look down the package column for curl, it's around the 9th line down it's there, see. When you get the row with curl, you can click where it says skip, so it will be set to install it instead of skipping it. I suggest maximizing the cygwin setup screen in windows 'cos it makes for less scrolling through the packages. here is a picture. you can install cygwin and you'll have curl running. cygwin is an application that lets you run *nix like commands, from within windows. 

bits are represented by voltages, it's not a moving thing. One can measure the voltage at 2 points on a wire. A printed circuit board(PCB) e.g. a motherboard, has the equivalent of wires, called "traces"/"conductive pathways". Parts e.g. CPU and RAM, are connected, directly or indirectly. I'm not that well read on this, but it used to be a set of wires running in parallel(8 wires would transfer a byte, one bit per wire), now of course, it'd be traces on a circuit board. The connection, often drawn on paper with a line or set of lines, is called a bus. So you could have CPU(drawn as a square) and RAM(drawn as a square) connected directly with a bus(drawn as a line or set of lines). You could have a chipset(drawn as a square), which CPU and RAM and other devices connect to. All the devices on the motherboard are connected. There is a subject called CPU architecture. You have a similar setup inside a CPU, with areas of storage(cpu storage locations are called 'registers'), and internal busses. So it fetches instructions from RAM puts it in a register, and (at the request of an instruction) fetches data from RAM(via a bus external to the CPU), puts that in registers, and processes the data(according to the instruction) and stores results in registers, and there might be an instruction to write that result to RAM, so that'd be transferred externally(onto a bus external to the CPU). Old books explain it with terms such as MAR(memory address register) MDR(memory data register) aka memory buffer register(MBR), address bus, data bus, control lines. it's worth looking up. any old computer science book would show it. like lett's pat heathcote a level computer science.
