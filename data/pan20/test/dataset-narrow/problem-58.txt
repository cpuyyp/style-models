For each method, you have a choice of using a default route or configuring/advertising all the known routes. A default route makes the most sense, since a full Internet routing table is over 500,000 routes. More importantly, your switch needs to only make a simple routing decision: is the destination locally connected or not? There is no need for additional routing information. Whether you configure a static default route or have the router advertise the default route via a routing protocol is up to you. 

When jong-mee logs in, she gets prompted for her password, and immediately goes into enable mode. But when Farouk logs in, he is only in user mode. Make the enable secret long and complicated so it can't be guessed. You won't have to use it anymore. 

If you're not using the native VLAN, there is no need to allow it on the trunk. If you do want to send/receive traffic on that VLAN then yes, allow it. 

Since you have enabled OSPF on the connected interface, it will be an internal route for the networks behind the CE1. But all OSPF routes on the CE1 side will be external routes on the CE2 side, because they all are redistributed to/from mBGP. To make them internal, you need a sham link. Administrative distance doesn't really come into play here. AD affects how the router forwards packets, but not necessarily what the routing protocol does. 

No, IP addresses need to be unique (like telephone numbers). You can subnet your /16 network into 64 /22 subnets. 

means that in order to start an exec sesion (i.e. a command line shell), the switch will check the Tacacs server for your credentials. Since presumably they're not there, the authorization is failing. It will only use the local database when the Tacacs server is unavailable. A helpful tip: If you have (read) access to the Tacacs server, check the "failed attempts" log or the Tacacs Events log (depending on the ACS version). It will tell you why the event failed, so you can go fix it. 

No, the numbers are right (Page 46). If I can reword your question, it's "Why should I use fiber if the propagation delay is worse than copper?" You are assuming that propagation delay is an important characteristic. In fact (as you'll see a few pages later), it rarely is. Fiber has three characteristics that make it superior to copper in many (but not all) scenarios. 

It is a conceptual model. That means it describes an idealized, abstract, theoretical group of networking functions. It does not describe anything that someone actually built (at least nothing that is in use today). It is not the only model. There are other models, most notably the TCP/IP protocol suite (RFC-1122 and RFC-1123), which is much closer to what is currently in use. 

Most of time, the terms point to point or point to multipoint refer to logical topology, not physical topology. One can configure P2P or P2MP on various type of media, and the ability to use broadcasts depends on the type of media you have. Ethernet is usually considered a broadcast media, where every station can hear every other station, but modern switched Ethernet makes it act like P2P, because the switch connects a sender and receiver with a single logical connection. And when you have a single Ethernet cable connecting two devices, that can also be considered a P2P connection although the media is still broadcast. In the context of OSPF configuration, again it's a logical topology, so you get to decide how it's configured. 

The route with the longest mask (/24) is always preferred regardless of how it’s learned. The protocol doesn’t matter. 

In theory you could send a packet with IP option 7 set (record route). This would return the path the packet took to the destination. In practice this option is not widely supported, which is exactly why traceroute uses TTL. 

They really have nothing to do with each other. The client workstation will send unicast data to the VIP, but multicast will be sent to the group address. The DR will then forward the data up the tree. By default, if there are two multicast routers on a segment, one will be the DR and the other will be the IGMP querier. IGMP joins and membership query/reports are all multicast. 

Let me clarify a misunderstanding: The DR is responsible for updating the LSDBs of the other routers on the network segment. It does not receive all the network traffic. All the non-DR routers make routing decisions and forward traffic. The purpose of the DR is to reduce routing update traffic and the number of adjacencies each router needs to maintain. The DR is elected based on the priority value in the hello field. This allows you, the administrator, to choose which router becomes the DR. If more than one router has the same priority (or you don't set it), then the highest router ID is used as a tie-breaker. Note that while the router ID looks like an IP address (and is often written that way), it is not an IP address -- just a (unique) number. 

From R1's routing table, I can see that R1 does not have a route to the 172.16.0.0 network. In other words, R1 doesn't know where to forward the packet to reach PC1. You need to add a route to R1's table, either with a static route, or configure a routing protocol. 

All you can conclude is that traceroute doesn't give you the information you wanted. Many organizations' security policies break traceroute by denying ICMP or high port UDP packets. That has nothing to do with your application. I can think of a few scenarios that would explain what you're seeing with the browser, but I would need to know more about your network and the remote app to give you any real advice. 

Yes the switch will drop the frame. But switches don't work like end hosts, so it's not quite right to say they operate in promiscuous mode. 

You need to know the free space path loss -- that is, the loss between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. With that you can figure out the radius of the area. 

IPSec is unicast, so NO. In order to use multicast, you will either have to establish GRE tunnels (over IPSec), or use VTI interfaces (if you're using Cisco devices). But I don't understand why you have redundant devices on one side, but only a single device on the other. That doesn't really help provide more availability. You may need to run a routing protocol to determine which tunnel to use.
