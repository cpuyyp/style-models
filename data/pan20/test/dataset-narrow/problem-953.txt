No DHCP server would assign 192.168.1.255 as that is the broadcast address The 172.16 is a bit obscure.. see RFC 1918 

See no error there with cygwin grep which is 2014. This is not the first time i've run into a bug in gnuwin32 version of grep when the cygwin version of grep was much later and fine. gnuwin32 seems to be very out of date compared to alternatives. 

In the case of a hard disk drive, nobody takes the disk out of it. They could though then it won't work. So you can talk of a hard disk drive storing things. But in the case of a floppy disk drive, you don't say a floppy disk drive stores things. It's the disk in the floppy disk drive that stores things and you can hit the eject button and remove or change the disk. All disks are non-volatile.. RAM is volatile. The difference between a floppy disk and a hard disk is that and you see this if you break open a floppy disk, it's floppy. And a hard disk drive if you unscrew it you'll see the disk is hard. And also prior to 3.5" floppy disks you had 5.25" floppy disks and even in their plastic casing they were floppy. And of course a hard disk stores much more data than the outdated floppy disk. 

EDIT The main thing is that clip command but as pointed out by Asu, a line like will also send a \r\n (which is a new line). If you want to avoid that, then that's a very standard issue solved by replacing , with So further addition You can of course then paste with right click, but for a command line paste too. unxutils has gclip and pclip (they don't seem to be in gnuwin32), with those you can copy and paste via command line. 

C:\tes> So you could replace *.mp3 with *.js and mp3prog with jslint that might give what you want. And remove the @echo Either or in those brackets works fine. You see it lists all the commands it would execute. It goes through every file in c:\tes and all its subdirectories. Or from any directory 

Networking is a huge complex subject. Try and make sense of the book. What book are you using, and what does the book say? Quote it. By local IPs, I don't think your book would've called them that, did it? Maybe you mean Private IPs. You can look up what a private IP is and then say what it is about it that you don't understand. The issue really though is how deep your syllabus explains it. You can always read a load of explanations on the internet, and it looks like you haven't really, you've just conjured up some "understanding" without stating/quoting any sources. Maybe you can quote the sources and we can see if the sources are correct or if you are misunderstanding them. 

I started up SFC, with SFC /scannow, and it wants a cd. I don't have one on me right now. I just want to kill the window. I may run SFC later. But how do I get rid of it? whether I click retry or cancel it doesn't go. 

What does that even mean. Is that a theological doctrine. "Hear O World, Microsoft is our deity, Microsoft is one" Sueteronomy/Billteronomy 6:4 

I have a computer with two screens.. A laptop with its screen. And another screen that I have connected to it that is much larger. I can move my mouse from screen 1 (The laptop screen), left to screen 2. But the problem is that if I move my mouse to near the bottom of screen 2, and right, I cannot get to screen 1. I'd like it so that if my mouse is, at the bottom of screen 2, and I move my mouse right, i'd get to the bottom of screen 1. And that if my mouse was 5% up screen 2, and I moved it to the right, i'd get 5% u pscreen 1. At the moment, there is a border the right edge of screen 2 at the portion where there's no screen 1. If I am at the bottom of screen 1, and I move my mouse left, I don't get to the bottom of screen 2, (as you can see from the ctrl panel display it's obvious why). though i'd like to. As you can see the way Windows works is the border that is shared by screen 2 and screen 1, no issue. The mouse moves across though if it's half way up one screen and you move it across it may not be halfway up the other screen. But where the border isn't shared, then one screen you hit the border, the other screen you get across. I would like the screens to relate to each other, so that at any position on one screen you can move to the side to the other screen. So the top of one screen relates to the top of the other screen. The bottom of each screen relate. The middles relate. So that even with different sized screens there isn't a portion of a screen where you can't go across. Is that possible? 

Your question is a little strange, because are you asking How do you set the remote computer up to only take access from your source computer, with ssh? Or are you asking how do you set it up to restrict access to only allow your computer, with anything, and then connect to it with ssh. Or are you saying it's already set up like that, how do you now connect with SSH. Anyhow, Look at this thread here it mentions a few ways to restrict access, it mentions doing so with SSH or with iptables(a firewall), and if you then want to then connect with SSH, that's just normal. 

You can use Google Groups $URL$ type the name of a group e.g. alt.computer hit enter, click alt.computer 

UPDATE Slight correction to the above. A)You asked re lines beginning with "2 RIN". B)It needed a non-greedy evaluation for one of the *s so that it matches before the first occurrence of ^1. C)You need to consider whether the file has *nix or Windows line endings. You can do a find in the document and look for \r\n or for \n, and see what matches, to see which line endings the file uses. That's one way. Your file has *nix line endings as is shown on the bottom right of the notepad++ window. So you want this regex You would want this one if it were Windows line endings which can happen if you were copy/pasting, then you'd want this regex But opening the file or a copy of the file directly, for sure, you want the \n version, the *nix version i.e. Because the windows software writing the file, is writing it with *nix style line endings. 

PS Tray Factory does it. It has a free trial , is not freeware, but is only $25. You can backup the system tray setting as a reg file. Here is an example of what is in the reg file. The data in the reg file is as you can see, specific to the PS Tray Factory program. (So the data there doesn't give away how windows does it). But the program seems to work. It also lets you order the icons the way you want. 

Acrobat XI can do it. I've done it or something like it before, there's a feature called annotations. Here is a youtube video of drawing on a PDF $URL$ 

then it asks for user/pass You can drag and drop too. You can double click say a txt file, it opens in notepad, write in it close it.. it will save on the FTP server. No fuss. It's quite seamless. There is also FTP Explorer which might've been free at one time but now has a 30 day trial Maybe the more complex ones help for changing between active/passive ftp. 

how about cygwin's cp? syntax like Replace c with mapped network drive as you require. Check you can it first. is like dir. 

I have a file Other - Analogue Clock-JEJqy1Wlovw.mp4 which is just a download from $URL$ It's 2 minutes 13 seconds long. I had some issues cutting it to the second. I was able to use this command 

Do you mean a virtual machine made in e.g. virtualbox or vmware has created a computer with a virtual ethernet adaptor and IP. And the server is bound to that IP. Ultimately the server is bound to an IP. It doesn't matter if that ethernet adaptor is virtual or not. (though i'd be curious how you made a virtual ethernet adaptor without a virtual machine, if you did). You could be clearer there, if you're to talk of a virtual ethernet adapter. 

Charmap can reach as far as FFFF which is far enough. Charmap show that it's not in segoeUI. But it is in Tahoma. 

There is Process Explorer run it as administrative (you have to run it as administrative for the following "processor network" tab to appear) view..select columns.."process network" Then click Receive bytes and Send bytes. Then sort by one of those columns e.g. Receive bytes. You can scroll right the right hand (window) pane, so you reach those 2 columns for bytes sent/received, and you still see process name as you see in the pic 'cos process name is in the left hand pane. It shows a total rather than a rate.
