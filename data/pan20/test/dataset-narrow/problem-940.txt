I'm creating a template document for a client in Word 2010. I'm trying to implement some instructions in the document, so that if the file is either printed or exported as a .pdf file, those instructions are not available/visible. Comments are quite nice visually speaking, but unfortunately I can't find a way to avoid them to be printed or be visible when exporting the document to .pdf. Is there any way to accomplish this? 

I've exported a pdf file with some content framed from InDesign. The content is a linked/embeded file (most of the times other pdfs). If I resize the frame of the content I placed to the portion I desire, the "out of frame" content will still be "present" in the resulting exported pdf file. If I open the exported pdf file in Acrobat Pro or Illustrator, I can easely find that the content is clipped and not cropped as I want, this way I can completely remove the clipping path that correspond to the frame I've set in InDesign, recovering the entire content of the files I placed. This is quite a problematic situation for 2 facts primarly: 

Ok solution with ImageMagick, simple and quick (but ofc requires the library). Open the cmd line in the folder you are interested (Shift+RightClick inside your folder window and select "Open command window here"), then in the cmd prompt use this 

What can I do to be sure that "out of frame" content is not present once I export the pdf file? I want "out of frame" content cropped/trimmed/deleted, not clipped. 

Please check the images below I've attached for better details. On the left side you can see the document layout in InDesign (transparent content is there just to show you what is the entire content placed), on the right side is what can be seen in Acrobat Pro opening the resulting exported pdf file. Notice that this happens placing pdfs and Illustrator files. 

I received a zip file from a Mac OS user with several hundred of .jpg files, some with very long names. Opening the .zip file wit 7-zip on my Win 7 machine, lots of these files have very weird characters; I guess they were encoded like this in the zipping process. Here is a sample 

This way I've reduced to the minimum the .txt output to a single line per image () and added a recursive option () so that it can process subfolders too. 

Since this is a problem across a wide array of applications, the easiest solution I found was just to rename the files in question to this format: filename.inc.php And then for security purposes to prevent direct access, I usually add this in my htaccess files: 

To run both cards in tandem, they both have to support SLI. Neither the GT 630 nor the 210 support SLI. PhysX is a physics rendering engine for nVidia video cards. It has nothing to do with SLI. However, if you want to use multiple monitors, yes, you can have multiple video cards to add more monitors. 

First place I'd look at is what you're using for a mousepad. Too much of a solid color or too shiny of a surface won't be read too well by most mice. Texture and color help with keeping the reading of a mouse's movements smooth and even. 

If it's "fake" AV software, using spybot's immunize feature and SpywareBlaster will prevent some cases of installation. Both are essentially killbit solutions. Another solution could be not allowing users to install anything--give them a power user (or lesser account) and lock things down via group policy. 

Try reinstalling irfanviewm, and when it gets to the point where it asks you for file associations, click the "images only" button. That will set all images to open in irfanview. 

In earlier versions of chrome, I seem to remember an "add exception" button on this screen, or on the certificate's information window (if you clicked the HTTPS in the address bar). However, that has long since disappeared. How can I add an exception for specific self-signed certificates in Chrome 28? 

Add your forwarding address as a POP3/SMTP account in thunderbird. Then, make sure you uncheck the POP3 account settings options "check for new messages" and "automatically download new messages" so you don't actually download the messages from your forwarding account For Thunderbird 3, the steps may be a little different. Then, when you go to send a message, just select the account you wish to send from. 

Save a backup copy of the project (just in case), then just open it in Visual Studio 2008. The upgrade will run automatically. Usually, there aren't any major problems, though it depends on your code. If there are problems, you will be able to see the upgrade log. Then, build your program to check if there were any errors introduced. If not, then run it and test it. 

I noticed a weird address in the Local Address column in the Network tab of Process Hacker in lots of program that work with internet connection (like chrome, firefox, dropbox, thunderbird etc..). The address in question is this one: hhbekxxw5d9e.pflexads.com. Most of these preocesses have the same adrress also in the Remote Address column. Some of these send and receive data over the network. I've tried scanning with Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essential, both with no results. I'm on Windows 7. My file is picked from $URL$ so luckly those requests are blocked, I'm no expert in these things and wondered what is producing this and if it's anything that should not be neglected. Any suggestions? UPDATE It uses small traffic, but it stacks up from time to time: starts with few bytes and then it goes for some KB. Fact that worried me most is that this address is in also 1password process and Teamviewer too. I'm no netowrk expert, but I've tried with Wireshark to filter the recordings with filters on what is listed on the Process Hacker network tab. Unfortunately the output of the filter is blank, wich is kinda odd to me since I can actively see reported in the network tab of Process Hacker that data is going for those processes through those ports. Am I blatantly missing something? 

Solution with ImageMagick I've placed below my solution with ImageMagick, is pretty quick and simple but ofc requires the library installed. 

The answer provided by Maximus is no longer valid for cmder 1.3+ You have to create a file (for ex. ) inside your cmder folder with your customized definition (source). Below my customization: 

Solution with ExifTool The best deal imo, with the command already coded in the file name of the .exe its totally a drag and drop script to use wherever you want! Update For convenience, I've slightly modified the inline file name of the exe to this 

Not really an answer but a sort of "work around". Since the Host OS creating the zip file is a Mac I tried uploading this .zip on a Linux web server I manage, then I unpacked the zip, and the files were correctly named once extracted. So I repacked the files in zip and downloaded on my machine, now all files have the correct names. I'll just leave this here as a quick memorandum, I hope there are are other solutions more practical than this! 

I wanted to reactivate my old Mac Mini (from 2007, OS X Lion 10.7.5) to use it for some server testing stuff. As I don't want to add another monitor, keyboard and mouse to my desktop, I want to control the Mac via VNC, like I already did it years ago. So I enabled screen sharing and connected to the Mac with my Windows 8 PC (RealVNC). That works fine, as long as I have a screen connected to the Mac. As soon as I disconnect the screen, all windows disappear and I only have the top and bottom bar. I can start every program, but it won't show any window. I can see popup windows (like the confirmation when I want to reboot) at the bottom left of the screen, but only the top of the popup. I can drag it in the middle, but if I let got of the mouse button, it jumps back out of sight again. I've already searched the internet, but only found old entries that said, that it is fixed with newer versions of VNC. Any help or alternatives? 

Well, isn't that actually what UAC is for? Prevent software to do something, if the user doesn't want it to do.

I had the same issue some time ago, just for some pages. For me it was my virus scanner (avast... or was it avira, one of them). I just exchanged it. 

I am using Outlook 2013 (had the same problem with Outlook 2010) and I have a little problem: If I receive an email, I get the usual envelop icon in the systray and a desktop notification. Now I have a rule to move an email to a subfolder (nothing more, just move) if it's from a specific person. For this mails the envelop is missing. Any ideas why? 

You could check the boot order in bios. My wifes PC was configured that way, that it tried to boot from every disc, cd, usb-stick or memory-card. If there was a memory-card in the card reader, then it showed the same behavior that you describe. 

Tell your people, that there will be a software installation and that they should accept it. If there are too many people/PCs to control, then install some kind of software deployment. 

From what others folks in saying on various forums, it looks like you'll need the 8.0.2 update for dreamweaver and compatibility mode set to XP SP2 (see Traveling Tech Guy's post) If that doesn't work, or try here: $URL$ 

That should allow you to enable/disable plugins, or view the file path of the plugin so it can be deleted from the plugins folder in opera. 

Right click on the file > properties > "Details" tab. Note that the time listed tends to shows the total amount of time that the document was left open, not actually spent changing things. 

Using a PC will actually be slower. It's not designed to route traffic. It's better to have a dedicated device to do so. Look at some Linksys equipment, and if that doesn't cut it, look at some of the low/mid range Cisco routers. 

As for SSDs, they're only limited by the number of write cycles they can perform on each cell in their flash memory. Theoretically, SSDs can last many, many years longer than HDDs since there are no moving parts. 

I have an XP SP3 workstation where windows update seems to have stopped working properly. Going to "update history" in windows update shows that the error is: 

You can also add blocklists for malicious URLs. Spybot's Immunize feature and SpywareBlaster both have that capability. 

You'll have to reinstall windows either from a CD, or follow an installation guide that takes the flash drive into account. There's no easy way to change it after the fact, especially since the drive paths for all the applications would also have to change. 

I installed a fresh installation of XP SP3 on a hyper-v virtual machine. Nothing is installed besides Microsoft Security essentials. If I try to install chrome with the alternate all users installer, I get this error: 

The pasted copies...well, if those are corrupted, there are some recovery tools that can help, depending on the filetype and damage done to the file. 

I've tried a manual uninstall for chrome, cleaning the registry with ccleaner, running the installer as administrator, and starting from scratch by installing XP SP3 again. Any ideas? I didn't encounter this issue a few months ago. Is there an older version of the alternative installer still available? 

A replacement must be the same voltage. Too little, and the battery won't charge. Too much, and you'll fry something. The amperage should be the same or higher. If it's too much lower, it either won't work, or the adapter will overheat making the attempt to power the laptop. If it's higher, the laptop simply won't use the extra available power.
