The value is not standardized, but the way I read the spec, any value other than "no" should suppress bounces. I also threw in the option as a fallback; if it works, it could be useful by its own, as many mail servers will not generate bounces for messages which have an empty envelope sender. However, not all sites allow you to control this. 

For this simple script, using double quotes instead of single will populate the variables from the parent shell. Of course, if your script contains strings or other expressions which should not be interpolated by the parent shell on the host where you start this script, those need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. But you don't seem to have any of those here. 

I have other samples in other languages so getting the Czech sorted out is not really my focus. Here is the beginning of one in, I don't know, probably some Far Eastern language? 

This is somewhat obscure, but apparently means and . The package's file listing reveals exactly what it contains. As of right now (version 1.6.6-1) it contains the following files: 

which is obviously a lot less efficient. With the Perl variant, I specifically rigged the script so that it keeps track of the line number for each input file separately, so you can use this more efficient syntax (provided your version supports it); whereas with the address 2 only matches the second line in the entire sequence of files, and so we are forced to execute one instance of this script per file anyway. 

For reasonably modern projects, see if the site where you downloaded the source from would also have some instructions, and/or perhaps a collection of pre-built binaries for your platform. Sometimes there are third-party contributed builds for godforsaken platforms even if the main development happens on and focuses on U*x or specifically Linux. 

With some hesitation, I would consider the header standardized in RFC3834 which allows you to suppress bounce messages for automatically generated email. As such, it's not really intended to be used on forwarded messages, but it's worth a shot. You would add that to the forwarded message something like this: 

I will concur with the comments to add the user to the group instead to solve this particular problem. 

Since the template is embedded in the program itself, there is no need for it to exist in any other file. To extract it on a system where you don't have a crontab, try temporarily setting your editor to . 

A common arrangement for appending to files which require privileged access is to use . Its primary purpose, of course, is to write to two places, but you can discard one of them and use the side effect that gives you privileged append. So, something like 

There are many criteria a web site could use to identify possible scrapers. Some are more prone to false positives than others. 

If you can remove the hard drive and mount it from a different computer, that's an easy way to do it. With modern compact laptops, accessing the internal hard drive is not always easy, but if you are lucky, there is a standard 2.5" drive behind two X screws that you can access from the side of the case, or sometimes the bottom. It's been a few years since I last did this, but I recall creating a small partition for the installer, and then just copying it over with . This would have been back in the day of floppy-based Debian installs, but things may not have changed all that much. These days, I would create a bootable USB image and copy that over, mark the partition as bootable in , and go. If you can get a hold of a USB cradle for your drive, that makes things a lot easier. 

Pretty much what the "Mouse Keys" that can be enabled via the Ease of Access Centre do, only those are useless because they are extremely slow and have a delay at the start. Some more info: There's a game I play that is similar to a flight simulator, but yaw and pitch are controlled by the mouse and there's no option in-game to remap this to keyboard buttons. So what I want is that if I press the 4 key on the numpad (or some other key, I don't care) then the game reacts as if I were moving the mouse to the left, with no delay or acceleration or whatever, just the way it works in normal flight sims where you use a keyboard by default. I don't need the diagonal directions, just up/down and left/right would be enough. Since I won't be able to control the cursor speed I'll need some way to set a fixed speed that feels right in the game, preferably separately for each axis. Edit: Since mapping some keys to joystick axes would also work I tried to find a program that does this, but no luck. It seems everyone needs to map joystick buttons to keys on the keyboard, but not the other way around. Surely this can't be that difficult? 

RivaTuner doesn't detect my dedicated graphics chip (AMD 7470M) which seems to control the fans, so I can't force fan settings. SpeedFan is unable to display the RPM and has no effect, and my mainboard (SJV70 HR) is also unrecognized. It's an OEM machine where I don't have any BIOS options and I was unable to find a compatible unlocked BIOS I could flash. So, is there a software solution for this? Not looking for general advice how to prevent overheating here, I just want my fans to run 100% all the time regardless of actual temperature, like they do on booting. Possible? 

One of the reasons I want to do this is that Windows usually distributes the CPU load evenly over all processors, but when you run a CPU-heavy single-thread process it often runs significantly slower than it could simply because 20% of the core it runs on is already occupied by other processes, and Windows seems incapable of moving those processes to other cores at runtime effectively. I know how to set processor affinity in Process Explorer, but a) this isn't permanent, b) you can't set default values for unknown processes, and c) it really isn't an option for the myriad of Windows' background processes. I'm basically looking for a solution where the OS automatically uses core 1 and user applications by default use cores 4/5/6, with me being able to specify in advance for certain processes to be moved to cores 2 respectively 3 instead. Is something like this possible? I'm running 64-bit Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter, but it's the Windows 7 kernel so solutions for Windows 7 might also apply. 

Edit: There is a Microsoft tool called IIS that is described as a web server but seems to have capabilities related to setting processor affinity for pools of applications. Does anyone have experience with this IIS and can tell me whether (and how) it can be used for my purposes? 

Not sure why my question was downvoted or why I never seem to get useful answers on Superuser, but in any case I finally got it to work by using the recovery console to reinstall the mainboard drivers from the DVD with DISM. The particular command that did it for me is with C being my OS partition and G the DVD drive. I had to reinstall the graphics chip drivers, but other than that everything is just the way I left it. So yeah, easy solution and none of the things I tried were even necessary. 

but then you'll need to make sure yourself that the (start, end) pairs in cover all of the space between 0x00000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF if you really want to examine all of it. (And again, notice that the range increments the last byte and that applies the bytes of the value in reverse, in accordance with your stated requirements.) If you wanted to use two different addresses, you quickly run up against the limits of what's feasible to do in your lifetime with brute force; but you could, for example, split the 4-byte number into two 2-byte parts and apply those at different offsets. 

The permissions are such that even does not have write access. Looks hard to fix, but should have the powers to override write protection. Just be careful to not change anything you're not supposed to. Assuming you have access, try this. 

You were never using or in the first place, and there was some other dead code in your script as well. 

I believe Choosy will let you do what you are asking. There is an Advanced pane where you can specify custom rules which trigger e.g. on specific URLs, and one of the options is to launch the URL in multiple browsers. (You may have to do something funky to convince Choosy that your other app is one of the "browsers", though. Maybe you can set up a browser you only use to redirect to your app, Chrome Canary or Opera or something else you don't otherwise wish to use.) 

I'm vaguely speculating that the encoding might be related to ISO-2022, but I am not familiar enough with it to really be sure. It has obviously gone through at least one broken filter, possibly multiple, before ending up like this. Looking at the first line, is Ñ“ and was probably a single 8-bit byte before the conversion. A general pattern seems to be followed by a signal byte, where the FF is some hex sequence in plain ASCII (mostly 83 here, but generally from 80 through 9E in the entire sample), and the final byte is now an UTF-8 character. (It could have been multiple bytes in the input as well, of course.) This sequence appears between words (always ?), and sometimes within words. Here is the same fragment as just text, as it renders under UTF-8 now. 

As an aside, you should not use locking on a forwarding recipe, a trailing wildcard is useless, and the flag is the default; so I took those things out. 

Without access to the malicious attachment, there really is no way to tell; but yes, I would be slightly worried. There is rarely a legitimate reason to send a forged email with an attachment. Another question entirely is whether your system was vulnerable to whatever exploit they were trying to pull off -- the world is still full of Windows XP boxes, and many of the prevalent campaigns still try to focus on this extremely low-hanging, rotting fruit. If you are one of them, I would certainly advice you to unplug immediately and start to plan mitigation. A good first step would be to not plug your computer back in to the network until you have a better picture of what happened. Copy interesting stuff to a USB stick and proceed with caution from a different computer (use an internet cafÃ© or whatever -- don't surf from your zombie box). 

The option says to modify the file "in-place" (i.e. replace the original file with the edited file). On some platforms (notably *BSD, and thus also MacOS) you need an option which can be empty to say you don't want a backup file to be created (or give it something like -i to save the original file as ). It is not hard to combine the two actions into a single regex if you want to make sure they only occur when both conditions are true (though this complicates matters slightly in that you need to understand how to use a back reference);
