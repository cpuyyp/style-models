That should allow you to enable/disable plugins, or view the file path of the plugin so it can be deleted from the plugins folder in opera. 

Depending upon what burning software you have: $URL$ Maybe this: $URL$ These days, VCDs are a pain. There are a few other tools kicking around, but they haven't been updated in quite some time. Which leads me to the next suggestion. It may be time to invest in a DVD drive at this point, since they're fairly inexpensive. SATA DVD Burner ($20, free shipping): $URL$ Or IDE DVD Burner ($24, $4 shipping): $URL$ And TDK 50-pack of DVD-R's ($10, free shipping): $URL$ 

I found a loophole. I unplugged the network cable, rebooted, then logged in as the domain administrator. Then, enabled the local administrator account and disconnected/re-connected to the domain. 

I'm looking for a way to accomplish this task. I've tried robocopy and writing a batch file, but robocopy doesn't seem to be able to do it (since /MINAGE can't do time--only dates), and writing a batch file to do all this is a little beyond me since it gets somewhat complicated and turns into spaghetti code. 1) Someone uploads a file to a source folder on a server (S-drive). 2) A few workstations check the S-drive periodically (once every 5 minutes). 3) The workstation has one file in a destination folder. If the workstation sees that the S-drive has a file that is newer than the file in destination folder on the workstation, the workstation copies only the newest file from the S-drive to the destination folder. Filenames don't matter here--only the timestamp does. On the other hand, if the workstation's destination folder has a file with the same or newer timestamp than on the S-drive (even if it's a different file name), it shouldn't copy the file. 4) The workstation runs a separate batch file to rename and process the new file. 

You should be able to download from your repo. With access to the physical volume, this will reset/clear your password from a linux environment. 

Then I would install MSDOS7 on hda1, and install 95 over it. Secondly, (and we're going back a couple of decades here, so excuse if I'm wrong) Windows installs >98 should have the option to which will install M$ bootmanager, and give you the list on startup. Once 95 boots, install 98 using above option, but to the second partition, and the same for ME. Or, if you're allowed to use superior bootloader, check this guy out: $URL$ 

Question possibly to be migrated to a parenting forum. Unplug the PSU from the wall, and the computer. Take it with you. When he "needs" it, he asks nicely and you sit and watch. If you have tenacity, he will get bored with this game before you and ask what he can do so you'll just leave him alone. Sand boxing doesn't block content, or account creation. Windows has implemented some kind of account heirachy but configuring it is likely going to be more of a headache for you than it is worth (and he will probably circumvent it anyway.) He shouldn't need admin rights for anything, "power user" should do. Specific access can be configured through gpedit.msc and lusrmgr.msc. You will need to go through those to suit your situation. If you don't require pornography, your best bet would be to block it at the router level (if your firmware supports it, or alternatively route all his traffic through a filternig DNS). You can also filter his network adapters by MAC address for time-restrictions. And as long as you set a decent password on the router he can't get around it, short of buying his own or using the neighbour's wifi. 

First place I'd look at is what you're using for a mousepad. Too much of a solid color or too shiny of a surface won't be read too well by most mice. Texture and color help with keeping the reading of a mouse's movements smooth and even. 

Save a backup copy of the project (just in case), then just open it in Visual Studio 2008. The upgrade will run automatically. Usually, there aren't any major problems, though it depends on your code. If there are problems, you will be able to see the upgrade log. Then, build your program to check if there were any errors introduced. If not, then run it and test it. 

The Adobe Reader 9.3.0 download from Adobe's site isn't the latest available version. Try checking for updates under the help menu and see if updating to 9.3.3 changes anything. You can also try an alternative PDF reader, such as foxit (which has a PDF plugin for chrome). Were you always running the beta version of Chrome, or did you just upgrade now to see if it addressed the issue? 

Only the paid version of DD-WRT has granular bandwidth monitoring. All the free versions just show graphs on current usage for the WAN, LAN, and Wireless network interfaces. (re-posted as an answer as requested) 

If all else fails, you can send your drive off to a professional recovery service. Typically, at minimum it costs $500 and can go upwards of $2,000. Here is one of the reputable ones (this used to be the company named "Ontrack"): $URL$ The bottom line is that for professional recovery services it all depends on how much that data is worth to you. 

If it's "fake" AV software, using spybot's immunize feature and SpywareBlaster will prevent some cases of installation. Both are essentially killbit solutions. Another solution could be not allowing users to install anything--give them a power user (or lesser account) and lock things down via group policy. 

Note: I don't know whether it's permissible to copy this answer as I did, even with my one addition. If it isn't, feel free to edit this answer and just link to the solution. 

I'm using Chromium (Version 30.0.1599.114 Ubuntu 12.10) under Linux. I'm trying to access a website that claims that it doesn't work under Linux. Of course, this is most likely crazy since the web is platform-independent (unless they're using some kind of evil plug-in). I've used a user agent switcher to supply a Windows user agent, but to no avail. Upon viewing the source, it appears that the site is using Javascript to determine the operating system. I'm looking for a way to get my browser to report in Javascript that it is Windows or MacOS. Do you know how to do it? 

I have the same problem as earlier. But, since AHK is a scripting language, is it possible to use it to change the repeat behavior? 

If you build your kernel following the proper procedures for building Ubuntu kernels (I don't know what they are), then when you install the resulting packages you'll get an additional entry in the GRUB boot menu. Your old kernel(s) will still be there unless you explicitly remove them. Recovery mode isn't a special kernel. It just boots a minimal system, using whatever kernel it's paired with. 

My sole internet connection is via tethering to my Android phone (OnePlus 3). In the past, I used WiFi tethering, and all was fine. However, I've been bitten by a phone bug which results in my phone turning WiFi tethering off every 5 minutes or less. I've configured Tasker to re-enable it, but my work requires a constant connection. All this makes WiFi tethering unworkable for me until my phone gets a bugfix update. In the interim, I've been plugging my phone into my Windows 10 laptop and using USB tethering to internet. This gives me reliable internet, but it causes the situation which is the subject of this question: When I'm connected to the internet via USB, certain Windows features don't work properly: The News and Weather apps take tens of minutes to open and frequently stop responding for a minute or two at a time. The Settings app normally doesn't work at all in the networking sections, and sometimes in the other sections. The taskbar's networking icon takes tens of minutes to reflect the current network status. Older programs (such as the control panel) don't seem to be affected, and Edge mostly works. Command-line tools such as and work perfectly. What's going on? This is an issue for me because I need to tell Windows to treat my USB tethered connection as a metered connection, but the Settings app won't open when I'm using that connection--and for some reason, the network settings available from the control panel and those available through the settings app are different. 

The card reader will be on the system's USBus. If you can't boot from USB then you can't boot from an sd card. Unless your device is very old, I would be surprised that it can't boot from USB, and therefore an sd card. 

Please note this is concept only, syntax oe&e, and will need tweaking to your environ. -edit for clarity- (at a computer now) 

A) Why? What is the point in having a "balanced" plan, that isn't? B) If you want identical plans with different names: Delete all plans and create new ones based on THE SAME base option. C) Windows probably doesn't give you access to every option, and plans created as "balanced" probably have flags (in the registry, knowing windows) to scale the CPU, or limit it's voltage or frequency, or drop cores, or otherwise "balance" the power demands. 

reboot in windows and you should be able to have your way with it. or just delete it. If you can be bothered trying to get your head around windows syntax, might work. Not being a windows user, I couldn't tell you how. 

The DNS of your router works to resolve outbound traffic. Your solution will involve port forwarding on the router (consult your manual) and probably a ddns client to be run inside your home network so your LAN is always available at www.$user375251.com Check $URL$ 

Possible: yes Easy: probably not. I have booted windows disk images via qemu, so nothing is impossible. Linux will be more tolerant of booting in different environments (virtualised vs native) and as long as the libs are there for each, it shouldn't cause too much trouble. Your best bet would be to hypervisor both windows and *nix. Alternatively if you want to "try before you buy" - write a copy of your nix partition to an ISO () or duplicate it to a vdi with your software of choice, and try booting that. More directed help could be found if you specify what emulation software you are using (Virtualbox, ie), and whether your CPU supports nested paging or virtualisation. 

In addition to mbair's answer, have a look at GParted. It will show you the individual partitions, their names, and any errors, all in a much easier form to understand than or its ilk. 

After receiving no replies here, I asked this question over on Microsoft's support site. I'm copying the reply I got there, with the one modification I had to make to get it to work. 

You should be able to use fdisk to add an extended partition with no trouble. I've done so a number of times in Ubuntu as well as in several other ancient distros. But I prefer the graphical program GParted. It's available as a live CD if you don't have X installed. 

After my computer decided to run some updates, I was unable to login with my PIN. I had to do a password reset. I'm trying to re-enable the PIN, but I'm having difficulties. I'm in Settings > Accounts ? Sign-in options. Under the PIN section, I should see an option to change or reset my PIN. However, that option doesn't appear. Instead, there's a button labeled Add. See this screenshot: 

I have a Windows 10 laptop with a keyboard designed by idiots. They tried to cram the arrow keys where they don't belong, with the result that the up arrow key is between the right shift key and the / key (US keyboard layout). This is one of the stupidest things the designers could have done, because it means that when I go to hit the right shift key (which is most of the time), I end up hitting up arrow instead. This is incredibly annoying. I found a program called Sharp Keys which allows me to remap the keys such that the up arrow behaves as shift and the right shift behaves as up arrow. Now, at least I can type. However, I've now lost important functionality for the up arrow key. Up arrow (now labeled "shift" on my keyboard) doesn't repeat. So, I can't just hold the key down to move up. Instead, I have to hit the key repeatedly. How can I fix this, so my right shift key behaves like up arrow and my up arrow key behaves like right shift? EDIT Following a suggestion from the comments, I installed AutoHotkey. I have the following script:
