I recently re-installed the OS on an old laptop, and just noticed that it seems to have some pretty bad keybounce. Could that be that I need to find and install a driver for the keyboard, or is it more likely that it is just an old laptop and is wearing out? I didn't notice the keybounce before the reinstall. 

After buying several dead and almost dead batteries, my neighbor has started taking a battery tester with her to the store. She buys the battery, opens it right then and checks it, so it's easy to replace if it isn't any good. 

I have two Excel (.xls) files that I'm comparing using Beyond Compare 3. When a record is different, it's messing up the alignment, and it doesn't fix itself for several records, so I'd like to manually realign the compare. According to their help, I right-click on a line and choose align. Except that align isn't on the right-click menu. Why? I'm comparing as 'Detected (MS Excel Workbooks)', Showing All. 

I'm not sure of this, but you should see if there are any Lego products that could be used, such as Mindstorms. They've got robotics that are controlled by your computer, so if you build a dog feeder with them, and then remote to your computer, you should be able to control it, right? Add one of the lego cameras to see how it works, and improve on the design. 

Do you work on multiple projects? If so, I might suggest under Development to then have subdirectories for each project, plus a directory for common or library code. Under that have the documents, the software, the database info, etc, like you have above. 

My neighbor is trying to search a pdf file for the word 'eight' but doesn't want 'weight', 'eighty' or other instances where 'eight' is within a larger string. She searched for ' eight ' (with spaces on either side), and it ignores the spaces. I just tried the same, and it ignores the spaces in the search. How do you get the pdf search to not ignore spaces? She has tried with a space before and after, both before and after; on Vista and Windows 7; with an Adobe reader and a reader/writer. It seems like there should be a setting, and under Edit/Preferences, there is a Search option. But I sure don't see how to set it to not ignore leading and trailing spaces in a search. 

First of all: don't ignore the warning, even when other browsers don't find anything suspicious (yet). When you can wait, then just wait some days until the warning is no longer shown! What you're seeing Microsoft nowadays calls SmartScreen ("Phishing Filter" in IE7; technical details). There's a "More information" link, that you can safely click. You can also get this information manually: 

And, things might be much more complicated, like for the Canon MP760 and the iP4000, which use a large BCI-3e pigment black cartridge, and smaller BCI-6 dye inks including yet another black (and yellow, cyan and magenta): 

The output of shows you reversed DNS addresses: a name based on an IP address. However, multiple names might exist for the same IP address. Like both , and refer to the same IP address†: . But: 

Run Time Machine at 10 am. Add some files to your Mac at 11 am. Run Time Machine at 1 pm. The files from step 2 will be added. Delete the files you created in step 2 from your Mac. Run Time Machine at 2 pm. The files from step 2, written to the backup in step 3, will still be on the backup, but no longer on your Mac. Run Time Machine at 11 am next day. All yesterday's backups will be deleted, except for the first which was created in step 1. Hence, your backup no longer holds the files you created in step 2 (and were deleted from your Mac in step 4). 

How do you make it show? If it is hidden then using will only temporarily show it until you press Return. What if you hit (pipe, so probably ) or use menu View, Show Toolbar, and then restart Safari right away? 

It supports a option, and outputs nice , , and commands. The script enforces using the Time Machine file structure. It seems to me that changing into , and also changing into , might make this usable for non-TM sources. It then processes each sub folder of the source folder, expecting each to be a machine name, being the root of all backups for that machine (typically one, unless the disk is used for multiple computers). Within each sub folder, it processes everything except for files named , or ending with . But: it does not expect the sub folders of the source folder to be hard links themselves. If you do have hard links in the source folder, then maybe you can mount the disk with an extra folder name. Like: use rather than , and then run for the source folder . Finally, it will also create a symbolic link named , just as a Time Machine disk would, for the most recent sub folder. You can of course delete that afterwards. You can then still do the , or maybe the output of can help to get a script that you can use in some other way? 

I want to install an anti-virus, but the downloads (AVG) need me to connect to the internet to install. Isn't it dangerous to connect to the internet before I've installed the anti-virus? Oh, and this is an ancient laptop and I've just re-installed Win98 (the only legal OS I had on hand). But that shouldn't matter. I do have my XP computer to get the files, and that has the anti-virus installed. 

In Outlook 2007 on a company network, I can see my contact information with I select the To button on new email, and find myself in the address book. The phone number is empty. If I right-click and choose Properties, I can see all my information. But it's not letting me edit this. Is this something that is edited and saved elsewhere? If so, where? Or, is it something that only the Exchange Administor or some other admin can edit? 

(It seems like this must have already been asked, but I'm not finding it.) I have a Word 2010 document, and I want to make a link in one part of the document pointing to another part of the same document. I have a table that needs to be filled out, and in the instructions about the table, I want to link to it. That way, they can easily get to the table referenced. 

Well, it is still in your clipboard, ready to paste. If you get lost, you could do another paste to an empty text file, and see where you were by what was pasted. 

If you're willing to consider a third-party tool, I would recommend BeyondCompare. It's easy to use, it has a very generous trial before buying, fairly low price, and is nice for both comparing and merging many different file types and directories, including Excel. You can copy individual lines from one file to the other. (I'm a BC user, and have nothing to do with the company.) 

I am trying to help a student. She has .edu in her email address and is trying to use Word 365. She has logged on, but when she tries to open a new document, she gets the following error: 

I've got a 84 page document that is over 13M in size! Another related document is much less than 1M, and it has a similar number of pages, pictures and tables. Is there a way to compact or clean up .docx files? It just doesn't make sense that it is that huge! It was initially created as a .doc file, and that old copy is huge too. 

You can easily see for yourself: open Applications, Utilities, Activity Monitor. Looking at the numbers for some application kind of tells you how much resources it needs. Mail, for example, hardly releases any memory when closed (on my Mac, just 4 MB as opposed to hiding). Other programs might release a lot more. Safari hardly releases anything when closing Super User (which is not a resource-demanding site), but might release a lot more when looking at some site that is showing some (paused) Flash video. 

Yes, right-clicks from the client are sent to the remote computer. (But something tells me you're having trouble with that? What does Ctrl-Click give you? Which VNC server are you using on the Windows machine? UltraVNC gives me no issues. Are you scaling the screen? Is everything else working fine?) 

Once saved, you cannot tell the quality anymore. (Setting the quality while saving just tells the software how much loss you find acceptable, but once saved: what's lost is lost. You'd need a human to say if something looks nice.) Hmmm, I guess I was wrong. I still think the above is correct, but ImageMagick's proves me wrong? 

This does not explain why it won't work with the hub, but on the MacBook itself, all USB ports aren't created equal. 

This will work in all modern browsers; you can have a look with yours. In Font Awesome, the code point is not U+F8FF but U+F179, and is U+F17A (both also in the private use area, like explained in other answers). 

Technically, the browser could indeed ignore the cookie's lifetime that the server has defined, which you already proved yourself. You might even be able to create some script that alters that file without the need to copy it.† Such changes will make the browser send the cookie's name and value (but not its expiry date) to the server along with the next request. However, at that point it's up to the server: 

Skype's static resources are hosted at Akamai, a content delivery network, that routes requests to one of their worldwide servers that is best suited for your location. Maybe the Akamai-generated Skype certificate is not valid on one of Akamai's servers, or maybe one of their servers simply does not host the Skype content at all (anymore) and Akamai is trying to show you an error page, using a different certificate. So, just a wild guess: maybe the router uses different DNS settings, which are either outdated (maybe referring to a wrong IP address altogether), or referring to an Akamai server that is configured wrongly, or for filtering DNS servers (did you set up something like OpenDNS some day?) referring to an an access denied page of the DNS server. You can try to try to find differences for the two connections. (The first line will tell you which DNS server is used, but that usually refers to the router or modem's IP address.) You can also compare the output you get with the output when using Google's DNS: 

I recently converted to Windows 7 and I usually have Office Communicator running. When someone else instigates a conversation with me, the notification pops up, but behind everything else, and as just another item in the taskbar. How do I make it pop up, so I notice that someone is trying to contact me? It does flash once, but if I'm already in another conversation, it's very easy to overlook that a new window has opened. And if I overlook that flash, then there's very little to make me notice it after that. 

All Programs, Accessories, Command Prompt -- that's as close to a DOS box as you get, but it still takes the old DOS commands: dir, cd, etc. 

In addition to the answer by Force Flow, they also provide different tools and a different UI. Access has a way to make tables, generate queries using a wizard, make reports using a wizard, make macros, etc. Compacting and other maintenance tools are built-in. It is an all-in-one little database. SQL Server has more power and less hand-holding. You need to know databases and SQL to use it properly, and it needs proper maintenance. 

There aren't any options to change that, no checkbox to unclick. How do I change it so it will kill the previous instance? Or, to a more basic question, what likely happened to cause this to start being a problem (because it has worked well for a few years)? I think the machine is Windows 7 professional. 

This appears to be a duplicate of $URL$ although my task is running a .bat file that runs an .xlsm program. It is supposed to run once an hour, and for the last month (at least), it is locking up pretty much every day. The task itself usually only takes a few minutes to run, so it should be well done before the hour is up. In the answer on the other question, the solution is to choose "Stop the existing instance". However, on my task settings, it has the following: 

What is the proper way for a student to open a new document? When she chooses OneDrive for Business, it does open a new document. But, since she's a student, not a business, I don't know how successful that will be, or if that is the proper direction.
