If we had an algorithm that decide whether $L(M)=\varnothing $ or not then it can be used for deciding whether for some $DFA$ like $M$ $L(M)=\Sigma^*$ or not,(by creating the DFA $M'$ from $M$ such that $L(M)=L(M')^c$). For deciding whether $L(M)=\varnothing $ or not suppose $p$ is pumping lemma number for $M$, then check for every string in set $A=\left \{ x\in \Sigma^*: |x|<p+1 \right \}$ whether it is in $L(M)$ or not, If $A\cap L(M)\not =\varnothing $ then $L(M)\not = \varnothing $. If $A\cap L(M)=\varnothing $ then $L(M)=\varnothing $, because if there exists a string $x$ such that $|x|>p$ and $x\in L(M)$ then by pumping down on $x$ we can reach a string like $y$ such that $y\in A\cap L(M)$ and this leads to contradiction. 

Proof. Suppose there exists such $m$, so by above definition we have: $$\forall y \in \mathbb{N} \neg \phi(m,m,y)\leftrightarrow \exists z\in \mathbb{N} \phi(m,m,z)$$ and this leads to a contradiction, therefore there does not such $m$. (note that $\neg \exists A(x)\rightarrow \forall x \neg A(x)$ has a constructive proof.) Define $$H_2(m):=\forall x\in \mathbb{N}\exists ! y\in\{0,1\} \phi(m,x,y) \land \forall x\in\mathbb{N}:\exists u \in \mathbb{N}\phi(x,x,u)\leftrightarrow \phi(m,x,1)$$ 

By Karp-Lipton Theorem we have: $$PH\subseteq P/poly\Rightarrow PH=\Sigma^p_2$$ So this theorem suggest it is unlikely that $PH\subseteq P/poly$. I want to know is there any similar conditional or unconditional theorems that study relationship between $LinH$ and $P/poly$? Thanks! 

I think if we want to answer this problem constructively, then we should be able propose problem constructively. Let language of arithmetic be $L=\{0,S,+,\cdot \}$ and $\phi(n,x,y)$ be kleene predicate in $L$. Now the first problem is: 

proof. If there exists such m, we can construct number $m'$ from $m$ such that $H_1(m')$ satisfied in natural numbers and this lead to a contradiction, therefore we have $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}\neg H_2(n)$. We can see that $H_2(n)$ means that "partial recursive function with code $n$ is a solution for halting problem". Actually we can not deduce constructively that $$\neg H_2(n)\leftrightarrow \neg(\forall x\in \mathbb{N}\exists ! y\in\{0,1\} \phi(n,x,y)) \lor \neg(\forall x\in\mathbb{N}:\exists u \in \mathbb{N}\phi(x,x,u)\leftrightarrow \phi(n,x,1))$$, but $\neg H_2(n)$ means there exists a time in tmeline that we figure out $\neg\forall x\in \mathbb{N}\exists ! y\in\{0,1\} \phi(n,x,y)$ or $\neg\forall x\in\mathbb{N}:\exists u \in \mathbb{N}\phi(x,x,u)\leftrightarrow \phi(n,x,1)$ although maybe we don't know which of them is true this moment. 

I studied Lenstra's paper $URL$ I have no clue what complexity he provides on Mixed Integer Programming (it is too terse and it is not a stand alone paper as he assumes arguments of Khaichayan and Von zur Gathen and Sieveking). However I understand from the line '..we indicate an algorithm for the solution of this problem that is polynomial for any fixed value of $n$, the number of integer variables' that the complexity is polynomial if number of integer variables is fixed. I am interested in complexity with fixed number of integer variables and polynomial number of real variables. Suppose we have $A\in\Bbb Z^{m\times(n_1+n_2)}$ and $B\in\Bbb Z^m$ and asked to find $X\in\Bbb Z^{n_1}\times \Bbb R^{n_2}$ in $AX\leq B$ then what is the complexity with with which we can find $X$? 

We do not have a deterministic constant factor approximation scheme for general $n\times n$ $0/1$ permanent. What is the best factor in deterministic approximation schemes if we only care counting bipartite perfect matching with average degree in $[2,3]$ and max degree $3$? 

The above scaling is consistent with case $n_1=0$ (Real Linear Programming) or $n_2=0$ (Integer Linear Programming). 

What are conjunctive/disjunctive truth table reductions and how do they compare with other reductions? 

Can we find $X$ in $O(n_1^{cn_1}((n_2+1)m)^cL)$ arithmetic operations on $O(L^c)$ bit words where non-negative $c$ is fixed and $L$ is number of bits needed in any entry of $A$ or $B$? 

We know $\#P\subseteq {PPAD}\implies PH\subseteq P^{{PPAD}}\subseteq P^{{NP}}$ and the polynomial hierarchy collapses ($FP^{PPAD}=PPAD$ following Emil Jerabek's comment). 

Why negative vote (this is a perfectly reasonable query seeking whether there is any strategy known that can avoid 'circuit'ous route and also addresses one 'minuscule' probability cause of why known approaches fail (just because except $P\neq NP$ everything we assume is false - this probability is technically nothing yet there))? 

Is there a down to earth explanation of what Lenstra is doing? What is the space requirement? What is a good reference for this type of mixed integer linear program? 

Of course it is a linear program that can be solved in polynomial time using ellipsoid method. But what I would like to know is if there are any combinatorial algorithms for this optimization problem. I suspect that the answer is 'no' since the problem looks pretty general to be solved combinatorially, but who knows... 

If adjacency lists are fixed in advance then DFS always terminates (even if there are irrational capacities). See Dean, Goemans, Immorlica -- Finite Termination of "Augmenting Path" Algorithms in the Presence of Irrational Problem Data. 

Let $G$ be an unweighted undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Is it possible to preprocess $G$ and produce a data structure of size $m \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n)$ so that it can answer queries of the form "distance between $u$ and $v$" in time O(n)? The problem seems too basic to be unsolved. 

There is very easy "deterministic" proof which gives a better $\epsilon$-net: that is, of size $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. You can find it here in Section 4. The idea is the following: we build convex hull of $X$, and then find minimal $\epsilon$-net that consists only of points from the convex hull. 

Is it possible to build an explicit $N \times N$ $0/1$-matrix with $N^{1.5}$ ones such that every $N^{0.499} \times N^{0.499}$ submatrix contains less than $N^{0.501}$ ones? Or probably it is possible to build an explicit hitting set for such property. It is easy to see that random matrix has this property with probability exponentially close to $1$. Also, expander mixing lemma is not sufficient to derive this property. I guess pseudorandom generators that fool combinatorial rectangles could help here, but they are designed for uniform distributions and I basically need $B(N^2, N^{-0.5})$ here. 

Let $\varphi$ be a CNF formula. Suppose that each of $\varphi$'s clauses consist of exactly $t$ literals (and, moreover, all literals within one particular clause correspond to different variables). It is well known that if every clause has less than $2^t / e$ clauses that share variables with it, then $\varphi$ is satisfiable (let us call such formulae easy). Satisfiability can be proved easily using Lovász local lemma. Moreover, using a recent result by Moser and Tardos one can show that one of the satisfying assignments can be found in polynomial expected time using the following very simple procedure: 

Given $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\Bbb Q[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ of form $\prod_{i=1}^df_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ where each of $f,f_i$ are homogeneous and each $f_i$ is irreducible what is the best technique to factor such polynomials? Assume $GCD$ of coefficients is $1$ after removing denominator. 

We know counting perfect matching for bipartite graphs with vertex degree $2$ is in $P$ while counting perfect matching for graphs with vertex degree $3$ is in $\#P$. We also know there are degree $3$ bipartite graphs that are planar whose perfect matching count is in $P$. 

What is known about counting bipartite perfect matching with average degree in $[2,3]$ and max degree $3$? Is there a cutoff degree $\alpha\in[2,3]$ such that if max degree $3$ holds then counting perfect matching count is in $P$? Is there any relevant literature? 

By $'$ I mean transpose. I gather the info here from rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/12/21/modulating-the-permanent. We know that if $U\in\Bbb F_{3^t}^{n\times n}$ satisfies $UU'=I_n$ in $\Bbb F_{3^t}$ then we can compute $Perm(U)$ in $\Bbb F_{3^t}$ in $O(n^4)$ time. This gives an $O(n^4)$ time algorithm for $Perm(U)\bmod 3$ for $U\in\Bbb Z^{n\times n}$ satisfying $UU'=I_n$ in $\Bbb Z$? 

We know that for every counting problem $\#A$ in $\#P$, there is a probabilistic algorithm $\mathcal C$ that on input $x$, computes with high probability a value $v$ such that $$(1 − ε)\#A(x) ≤ v ≤ (1 + ε)\#A(x)$$ in time polynomial in $|x|$ and within $\frac1ε$ multiplicative factor, using an oracle for $NP$. That is $\#P$ can be approximated in $BPP^{NP}$. 

In general determinants have many identities. Would it help the $GCT$ program by invoking the paradigm of identities such as to state that if the permanent is converted to determinant then it has to satisfy certain identities and therefore by reason $x,y,z$ we get lower bound on permanent or does it reduce to the symmetry characterization also (simply because determinantal identities follow from symmetries)? I am asking this because may be there are identities (I cannot think of one) that need only fewer essential symmetries (other symmetries just follow as consequence) making it easier to prove lower bounds (any superpolynomial lower bound on weaker assumptions can only be good).

The influence of variables on boolean functions, J. Kahn, G. Kalai and N. Linial This paper introduced Fourier techniques for TCS community and solved very neat open problem. I find this paper very readable. 

I have recently learned the proof of Haussler and Welzl of the following theorem. Theorem. Suppose we have a set system $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$, where $X$ is a finite set. Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ has VC-dimension $d$. Then for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a hitting set ($\epsilon$-net) of size $O(\frac{d}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ of the following subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$: $\{F \in \mathcal{F} \mid |F| \geq \epsilon |X|\}$. The proof itself is essentially a probabilistic argument. Despite its simplicity it looks very unnatural (we consider very mysterious coupling). There is an interesting non-trivial case: suppose $X$ is a finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of subsets of $X$ which can be separated from their complements by half-planes. It is easy to check that in this case $d = 3$. Is there a proof of the existence of a good $\epsilon$-net in this case from the first principles (without introduction of VC-dimension)? 

Suppose we have $n$ points in $\ell_2^d$ and want to do a dimension reduction. If we want pairwise distances change by at most $1 \pm \epsilon$, then we can reduce our dimension from $d$ to $O(\log n / \epsilon^2)$. This is Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. For a decade the best known lower bound for a dimension was $\Omega(\log n / (\epsilon^2 \log(1 / \epsilon)))$ by Alon, so there was a gap of size $\sim \log(1 / \epsilon)$. Recently, Jayram and Woodruff closed this gap by improving Alon's lower bound. Their proof barely relies on geometrical structure. What they do is they prove that if a better bound was possible, it would violate one particular communication complexity lower bound. And this bound is proved using information-theoretical tools.
