Couple of hints: - if you have always "timestamp " at the beginning of the string and length of number is variable: - if you know only that there is a space (it'll split at the first one!!): - if you don't insist on formula than "text to columns" function of Excel is also nice. 

You can do it without helper formula too. Just select your data, go to home - conditional formatting - new rule and select "use a formula to..." Here enter e.g. this formula: 

It's generally recommended to change both password / key, otherwise others with a very basic knowledge on default passwords could connect to your device, best case just for using your wifi, but worst case to install malicious software. 

It seems that using the formula with the array forces Excel to use array formula. To have the same functionality with the range, enter that formula as an array formula too, so after typing it press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER 

In Outlook 2013 it's possible to answer / forward emails in the main window of outlook, without "popping out" the message to it's own window. However there are only limited options available during this, what I really miss is to change editing language. 

Insert a column in each sheet to check whether value in the first column occurs in the first sheet: You will get in the rows having first column occurring in the first sheet, filter for them and delete them. If you have several sheets and you need even quicker solution then you need a macro. 

You have now row number in column D and in column E for each of your entries, with the function now you can collect the data you need. (it's also possible to do everything without any helper column but formulae will be far more complex that case) 

NO, THERE IS NO WAY FOR THAT This is the primary goal of encryption: prevent access to the content without the key. 

Unfortunately there is no ultimate tool / way exists to this problem. However there are steps which can help: 

I've accidentally changed default program to open .vbs files to Visual Studio. Now I want to change it back to "Microsoft Windows Based Script Host", but the check box to "make it default" is disabled, how can I solve this? 

is just two operators next to each other, "in which it can be used" question isn't really applicable to it, the right question would be to which data type it can be applied: 

This solution marks all duplicates, it's good to filter for them, if you want to remove them instead, then maybe you don't want to filter for first occurrences, only for repetitions, this case just change reference from to Update 1 If order of components is not the same in all the items, then you need to sort them in order to make this process working: at first order by "Component", then by "Item". 

In theory yes, however malwares are designed to ignore such restrictions. Maybe you could be successful at the beginning, however if many people would use this strategy I suppose malwares too would adapt quickly. Also creating such a positive list and always provide a password could be tricky, there are many programs which requires access to data for various reasons (anti malware, indexing, disc defragmentation...) 

If your data is stored as date (number) then you can use function. If it's stored as text, then function may help. 

I couldn't find documentation on it (this one doesn't contain details), but apparently is the only option for error bars in Excel which shows a "band" around mean, all other options (fixed value, standard error, ...) are all drawing the bars around the data points as you've expected. This is probably by desingn, and you can't change it unfortunately. 

Tracking and managing addition / deletion of rows could be extremely difficult (make sure to capture it always, also need to either modify the code itself for the new row number, or store it somewhere on a sheet...), I suggest to use some workaround. 

It is an array formula (need to press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER after it) and also a bit longer, but probably better shows the logic of the formula. 

You start your formula in row 3 that's why it starts from 3rd result. Either start in first row or use . Why do you need to use formula at all? I'd use pivot table (if you need to show cucumber in each row you can set "repeat item labels"). 

create a column to show whether a row is the last one of an item: in next column you can show whether an item is duplicate: , where: 

You need to add a new column to your data showing whether actual row is the latest date of the given title. (supposing that your original data is in columns A-D and you put your first formula in E2) This is an array formula, so you need to hit CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER after you've typed it. Now just add the new column as filter in your pivot and filter for . 

There can be generally two issues: number stored as text or rounding. I think in your case it's rounding, the parts displayed are the same, but there are small differences. For comparison use 

To use that, you need to convert your range containing keywords and categories to a table (insert - table), you might need to change table's name in your formula. 

This function looks for the first and extract the text from that until the next space To extract the number after : 

(you can also multiply by 1). After converting, your short will work as expected (also rows will be moved together by default). Update of course, your original text formatting should match regional number format, if not, then you need to fix it (select range and use find - replace) before 

Easiest solution is probably to add a helper column where you calculate the rank of each player. To make formulas auto-updating when you add new items, and also making them more readable I suggest to convert your raw data range to list (insert - table). 

Always check the output, if both are within criteria and results the same final output, then both can be correct. 

open replace dialog in notepad++ (CTRL+H) for search mode select regular expression check the box "wrap around" in "find what" enter - see here for explanation in "replace to" enter press "replace all" 

Use scatter plot instead of line chart, it's more suitable for your goal. Enter (0,0) also at the end of your series then insert - charts - scatter - scatter with straight lines (last ones). This way also you'll be able to manage other charts in a more flexible way. 

How it works: compares column values to first column and count the ones which are the same, if all are the same then it'll be equal to total number of cells in that range (). 

There are two issues here: Select the desired range: In Excel you can also make a selection by typing it's address in address bar: 

It's correct at my side. Please note that pivot tables doesn't update automatically, you need to manually go to pivotTable - Options - refresh to show the latest data. If you wan't the table updated whenever you open the sheet then you need a macro for it. You can find several guidances by searching for "excel automatically update pivot table vba", one example is this. To switch of grand totals: in "pivotTable tools - design" tab at grand totals command select "don't show grand totals". 

You need to insert your code into a one-cell table or into a text box (make it's alignment "in line with text"). Then you can hide the borders and add a caption to it. 

You're just lucky with 6:00 as that divides one day (24 hours) without remainders. To "round down" to previous 6:00 / 7:00 you need to: 

Why do you think manufacturer has not designed well the device and you can make a significant improvement by replacing batteries? Very likely it's not the case. If you need more service time, you need to buy a bigger UPS. 

If I understand your question correctly, you need to insert data from your form into kind of parallel databases. There is no built-in process for this kind of activity, you can do it by using some complicated queries or writing macro to decide where to load. 

While other answer stating that those are binary files is true, hex editor is probably not the native tool to use them. There are plenty of programs using binary files with .dat extension, also plenty of them having different standards how they convert data to binary. So while you really can edit them with a hex editor you probably won't be able to understand their content. The only option is to find out somehow which program has created them and open them with it. 

note getting your data from the site it wasn't automatically recognized my excel as time, I had to use function as in first screenshot; best approach however to convert already the original column to time if it's text 

Theoretically, now you can set your chart now, and it'll exclude those points, however I couldn't set it up with a normal charts. But it works with a pivot chart: 

This will return for names having Chicago, and for names without Chicago. (same logic as your subquery would do in SQL) Just add this new column for your pivot table filter and filter for . 

simply counts occurrences of value in the first column above the current row. Improved formula to manage empty rows: 

Fill the formulas down to 31 rows, it'll display only dates in the month, cells below will be empty. 

Facing the same problem, my solution was (considering big number of sheets, and possible multiple pivot / data tables per sheet): 

You can't do that. When you insert your table of figures, you can deselect "Include label and number", however that will also remove the number. If you really need to show number, but don't show "table", then you need to do it manually. 

The logic is the same for both: first part check which employee / day has overtime, then sum those employees / days. Alternatively you can use this formula too (this to be entered to D6): 

If I recognize the pattern well, you have: space at the end of the line, then 24 spaces at the beginning of the next one, you need to remove them: 

The formula is: It does only the subtraction even if both C5 and D5 contains numbers, as you wrote in your question. 

I'm using SQL Developer 4.1.5.21 (under Windows 7 Professional 64 bit). (I've just downloaded latest version (17.3) and the issue is still the same.) Whenever I click or select a table name in the left pane it opens immediately. How can I prevent this behaviour and be able to just select a table without triggering anything? I've tried looking in settings, but couldn't solve it myself. Detailed description of the issue
