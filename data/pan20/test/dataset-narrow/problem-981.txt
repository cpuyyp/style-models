All data on your hard disk can be erased again, that's why you have written and drawn everything with a pencil, and not a ball-pen. Now you write a shopping list into your book: p. 16-17. Next, you don't like or need that drawing any more and want to erase it, so you remove it with a rubber. Pages 11-15 are blank. Your TOC looks like: 

Spoiler: There will be a YES answer at the bottom of the post Short answer: NO. Medium-sized answer: NO, because there are 2 processes that want to access one ressource (the hard disk) at the same time. Each process will read different data, so the head needs to jump to the place where the process needs data from the platter. This jumps take a lot of time and decrease the total throughput of your hard-disk a lot! Long answer, because you seem to lack some (basic) understanding of the working principle of a hard disk: NO, because your spinning platters hard drive behaves like a book. Imagine that you have a book with only empty pages. That's your hard disk when you buy it. No data stored on it. Then you put it into your computer (let's say as a 2nd drive, so we don't have to deal with the operating system here). When you write a long text document (called 'text A') and save it on the disk, then it's like writing the first 10 pages (pages 1 to 10) in your book. Then you copy a jpg picture onto the disk, that's like make a drawing of your house on the next 5 free pages in your book (p. 11-15). The table of content of your book now has 2 entries: 

I have a source folder which I want to use as a starting point for multiple distinct target folders. This can be trivially done by copy-pasting the source folder, then just using the new directories. However, this results in a copy of the source folder each time. If I use a symlink or junction (as far as I can tell) then I can have multiple other 'directories' that have the same content as my source, but they aren't really distinct. To clarify with an example, if I have

If I log out, then back in, the two fields are both , as expected. is not a console-kit supporting dm. Therefore, I am using the module to attach a consolekit session. The sddm startup file () is modified to launch using the line: 

Issuing fixed this problem. The startup issue was due to the mtab file having entries not properly removed during shutdown. Once the root filesystem was added to the mtab file (after boot), the shutdown occured properly and then startup also works fine. The line added to was not needed after the mtab file was correctly set. If the computer loses power/is shutdown forcefully, this has on one occasion become broken again. Then the steps above correct the problem. 

Ports 8000 and 8080 often are used for Proxy server functionality. Maybe you have ICS (Internet connection sharing) or something similar enabled that is blocking this port. You should also check if maybe falsely two instances of your server are running. 

Now you want to draw an image of the local supermarket, which is bigger than your house. So you need 12 pages. You could start at page 11, which means you'd have not enough consecutive pages and you need to continue at 18, or you could start at 18 and have enough space to draw it in one go. Most or all operating systems are smart enough to choose a chunk of free space that is large enough for the whole data, but if there is no sufficiently large free space, it will have to divide the file into smaller pieces that fit into the existing free areas. This is called Fragmentation. Let's imagine you also need to do that. Your TOC looks like: 

DGS-1008a is a Fast Ethernet Switch. Fast Ethernet does not have Auto-MDIX, which would swap pins if a crossover cable would be needed where a straight cable is installed, or vice versa. If the other switch also hasn't Auto-MDIX, they cannot connect if the wrong cable is used, or the cable is falsely connected to the sockets in your wall installed in your wall. Your computer very likely has a GBE port. The have become standard years ago. Your computer is therefore able to switch pins if needed. What is the 16port switch? It is a GBE switch, thus it should have Auto-MDIX, but maybe it doesn't. Try a crossover cable between wall socket and DGS switch. 

During boot, some/many mount points in are not mounted. The file contains these mount points - my understanding is that the system believes the filesystems are already mounted. Modifying my script (taken from LFS) with the line

My understanding is that this is due to being unable to find a linker to open the executable. gives , as expected. Any ideas why this is happening / how I can fix it? P.s. - "Install 32-bit compatibility libraries using sudo apt get ... " not helpful, since don't have apt/pacman/etcetera. If I need to reinstall a specific (32-bit) library, then knowing that would be helpful!

passing in values in a form like (not ), but now I have strings which don't expand. Using might solve this for me, but other questions, answers, websites etc etc suggest this is generally a bad idea. How can I solve this problem in a better way than 30 lines of 10x3 ? 

Now we start READING the book. You want to know the items on your shopping list. The TOC tells you to go to page 16. You start reading until you reach the bottom of p.17. Done. Next: you want to see how the supermarket looks like where you want to go shopping. The TOC tells you to go to p.11 (you are on p.18 (= end of p.17) and have to browse 7 pages back. On a hard disk the read-write head needs to do a jump. Then you start reading until you reach end of p.15, then you browse to p.18 (head jumps again) and continue. Browsing in a book takes less time than reading, but on a hard-disk it's almost the other way round. The head cannot just move to the next track/cylinder, but has to 'search' the correct cylinder (acceleration, motion, deceleration, settling time). See Wikipedia. So due to fragmentation your reading takes longer than if the file was stored consecutively. And now, we do READING WITH 2 PEOPLE: You want to see the supermarket image and I want to read your text A. You browse to page 11 and start reading. When you have read p.11, I browse to p.1 and start reading. When I have read. p.1, you browse to p.12 and continue reading. When you have read. p.12, I browse to p.2 and continue reading. ... you can imagine that it takes a lot longer to read the pages just because the many browsing takes so long. Same with your hard-disk. You can't do nothing about it but avoiding simultaneous access as this always makes it slower. Now, finally, the YES answer: YES: Buy a SSD. This is a electronic disk and it operates like RAM, so you have almost no seek times and the total throughput is always close to the maximum possible throughput (if there are no other bottlenecks elsewhere). 

Opening programs via the 'Application Launcher' menu, then selecting the program works. Using the launcher generated on the panel, eg by right-clicking on an open program, then selecting 'Show A Launcher When Not Running' places a .desktop file which is opened with . returns , as does the same command for etc. then returns , explaining why the files are being opened by . Presumably the problem here is that the mimetype of the files should be something other than . What should it be? Is there a simple way to check/find out/change these? Note: KDE-5, Plasma-5, (C)LFS, source installs, etc. No package manager. 

I fixed this (sort of - using my not-preferred approach) by creating a System Backup using AOMEI Backupper Standard to another HDD, then using the Windows PE USB to reinstall Windows 10 onto the SSD. This means I'll have to put the Linux installation back on after, which is annoying, but after a day and a half of restarting over and over I was out of patience and need to get on with things. I then used AOMEI in 'Restart Mode' by booting to the new Windows, and trying to restore from the System Backup. I chose NOT to use System Restore, instead taking only the C: drive from the backup, and overwriting the (new) C: drive on the SSD. Following this, the partition wouldn't boot, but I now had a working Recovery partition. This allowed me to get the Command Line open easily in the Recovery Tools, where I used BCDEdit after assigning drive letters using DiskPart. I observed that the and fields shown by were 'unknown'. I then used 

Afaik, if you create a FTP share, then you can set the user rights only per share, but not per subfolder. That is because the FTP server usually has no control over the shared content (files, subfolders). You'd have to apply additional user rights e.g. from the operating system, but they cannot be combined with FTP, because all FTP users are given the OS user acoount rights under which the FTP server runs. Conclusion: it's not possible in the way you try to do it. But you could for example create another FTP share, which targets the subfolder directly, and give it different user rights, which are those that you want for this subfolder. 

You could check on the target computer, which user account was used to create the connection. There's a Windows tool , try that. 

I have a put a border/frame around a text paragraph, that spans over 3 pages. It is a code sample. The frame has a vertical line at the top of the paragraph on the first page, then 2 vertical lines at the sides of the paragraph also on the first page, and then an unwanted horizontal line inside the paragraph at the end of the 1st page. So, the frame is closed at the end of this page, although the code sample continues on the next. Same procedure at the 2nd page, it starts with the horizontal frame line, although the paragraph has started at the previous page. Using a 1-cell table is not an option either, it also has the unwanted horizontal lines at page ends/beginnings. Is there any option to avoid the closing of the frame at page ends and "reopening" at page beginnings? I only want the vertical lines as long as the paragraph has not ended.
