(note that the commit switch to sign off is lowercase "-s" and NOT uppercase "-S", as you typed in your question). After having done this, you can start doing your commits using your newly created "c" alias. Here's an example of creating and commiting a file called "test.txt" that will be signed off by the committer: 

Great. So this seems to be working in several cases (although I guess there may be more efficient solutions). So, how does this work? Here's the basic rundown for the "VAR_3" example... The first part - - returns the following output: 

Maybe you can do the following: have one open "Command Prompt" window where you run the "ftp command" and have another "Command Prompt" window where you run the query. I hope this helps. 

Imagining your input is saved in a file called "test.txt", you can use "awk" with the following syntax: 

To sign automatically all future git commits, you can define a global alias. For example, to create a global alias called "c", you would do this: 

I have a fairly fresh Debian Testing install, and I am trying to install PEAR / PECL but when I run the command nothing happens. I don't want to install the PEAR package in the Debian repositories because in my experience it is too old. I have installed php5-dev. Here is what I tried: 

I'm not sure if this is a Squid subject or IPTables. In my Squid configuration I have something like this setup: 

Where is a symbolic link to and is a symbolic link to . If I transfer I get the entire directory, but if I transfer I only get the symbolic link. On the computer I have downloaded it to this symbolic link is broken. Is there a way to tell VSFTP to follow the symbolic link and download the file? 

When I received warnings that the hard drive was almost full. I panicked and Ctrl-Ced the import. Twice. Looking at my DB I can see that the import was canceled. However when I look in I can see is still too big - I guess it still has all the imported data in it. It's about twice the size it should be for the data available in the DB. I ran but if anything it made the file larger. How can I clear this orphaned data out? I have about 100MB left on the hard drive ... 

I have just checked a Windows Server 2003 computer with disks formatted in NTFS and indeed there is a "RECYCLER" hidden directory / folder in C:\ and, under that "RECYCLER" directory, there are several (also) hidden sub-directories with names started by "S-" I hope this helps. 

The IBM website has several articles about installing Linux in the "IBM System x3850 M2" model, specifically about installing RHEL 5 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5), RHEL 6, SLES 10 SP2 (Suse Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 2) and SLES 11. So, I guess that those Linux distributions, at least, are (or were) supported by IBM for that particular model. The articles are the following: IBM Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 5 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (Type 7233, 7234) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP 2 - IBM System x3850 M2 (7233) and System x3950 M2 (7233) $URL$ Installing SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 - IBM System x3850 M2 and x3950 M2 (7141, 7144) $URL$ Regarding the keybind combinations to start the installation, it seems you may find them in the section 4 of the articles above. Let me quote here the "4.0 Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 6" section from $URL$ 

I am under strict Change Control for this environment, I would disable ipv6 from the network adapter to see if this makes any difference, but even this can take ours to sort. Can anyone suggest anything why this is happening ? Reg settings - reg_settings reg_settings_1 

However ... USB1 is persistant, although I change it to USB0, save as dfl and try again it still comes back as USB1. Now I have tried using the following: 

We have configured a Pi to be a recovery device, OOB access for a core router. It connects to a Cisco serial over a FTDI USB Serial Device converter 

I originally configured and tested this access locally to another device before and it worked fine. Now it's live in a remote DC (of course) it doesn't work. Intrestingly: 

We have a number of severs for different customers that are separated in to different computer groups, these machines are not on a domain although hook in to WSUS with a registry change. Some Machines for customers are reporting fine, however some are not. The Registry settings appear to be the same for all customers, however in the windowsupdate.log file I am getting the following from machines not repoting in to WSUS - 

I'm not really a user of Acronis Backup 12, but the following quote from Vasily Semyonov (Acronis Virtualization Program Manager) in the Acronis Forum seems to confirm that product version doesn't have a "classic" traditional GUI anymore, but only a web interface / web console (the bold emphasis is mine): $URL$ 

First of all, I knew about WMI - Windows Management Instrumentation - but I must admit I did NOT know about WMIC - WMI Command-Line :) I have found the following blog post that I think helps here: Rich's Blog - Get Process CPU Usage Using WMI $URL$ In that blog post, the author uses the Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process class to get the CPU usage of a process (in several ways). For instance, if the name of the running process is "iexplore" (Internet Explorer) then you would run: 

If I understand the question correctly, you want the "www" group to have 'read', 'write' and 'execute' privileges on the "/opt/apps" folder (directory) and subdirectories. In that case, use the command like this:
