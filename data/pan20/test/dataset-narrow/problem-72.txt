Never add a switch to your network without zeroing the vtp revision and putting it in client or transparent mode. If the switch has the same domain and password, is in server mode and the revision is higher it'll wipe out your vlans. If this does happen you can re-add them and things will come back. The vlan assignment on the ports don't get wiped thankfully! 

Option 3. If you just need raw numbers you can do for example and get some numbers. Option 4. If you can get a copy of Cisco Network Assistant (CNA) (deprecated) or other Cisco monitoring software that could be an option. They can also graph bandwidth while your on the software but no history like PRTG. 

I'm assuming this is cisco since you mentioned Vtp. When you do a show vtp you'll probably have one switch that is in mode server. The rest are probably in mode client. If you add a vlan to the one that is a server it should show up on the others. The vtp domain name and vtp password have to match on all switches and the revision number on the client's need to be the same or lower than the one in server mode. The revision number increases with each change. If a client has a higher number it won't take the changes because it thinks it has a newer config. Check these items to troubleshoot. 

There are many reasons. Instead of working by IP it uses DLCI and can route based on application versus ip for example. Rerouting in a disaster can be very fast. If they add additional "sites" the mesh they create is great for redundancy. Instead of copying and pasting a bunch of info check out this document (at the end). It'll give you good info to be armed with when you talk to your customer next. It's a pdf by Lucent. It's a high level explanation, not to detailed. Then when your customer tells you why they want MPLS you'll have a little more understanding. Link 

On the dhcp side just verify your scopes are correct. Make sure you can ping the dhcp server that is in your ip helper command from the switches. I have seen where ip helper was in place but the network the dhcp was on wasn't routed properly. Verify your vlan interfaces that are gateways have ip helper addresses pointing to the right server/servers. If that is all correct do some troubleshooting with Wireshark. To see what servers are replying run Wireshark with a filter, capture the traffic and do release renew your address so it request an address. 

Do you have routes in 192.168.4.254 that point back to the addresses in the switch? You need to point 10.10.254.0/24 to 10.10.254.1 and 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.1.1.1 inside 192.168.4.254. 

The disadvantages of securing anything is ease of use. Forgotten password, locked out ports, etc. Is it worth creating good passwords? That's up to your situation. I personally think it's not worth the possibilities of hacking to not secure a device. Lock it up! But, when you talk about switch security there is so much more than a login. Port security, DHCP Gaurd, vlans, ACLs, etc. Basically, when securing anything there is a balance of ease of use and ability to support and monitor that security feature. 

If you try splitting pairs you may be able to get a 100mb connections but you will chance burning up the POE (power). If you put another switch at the cable that is there now you will add a failure point to a WAP that probably services several users. That's not a deal breaker though. Also, you would most likely need a switch capable of vlans so you can run your data vlan, phone vlan and any vlans you have for wireless SSIDs. If you don't mind getting a quality switch and programming and securing it properly this could be an option. If your really only adding 1 phone and 1 computer this adds complexity and confusion. If this is a good area to extend your network this could be your opprutunity to do it right. Running a cable to a currently available switch port programmed as a trunk port or access port with voice features is the "normal" and "clean" method for the situation you've described. Set up the vlans on that port and you should be good to go. 

If you are the computer that is the receiver of the traffic you want too capture (which is what it sounds like you are) maybe its there and a proper filter will help. I've read that GVSP can show as UDP. Here are some wireshark filters for GVSP. GVSP Wireshark filters If you know your setup correctly first make sure firewalls are off. There may be Features on your nic that need changed. In windows you can go under device manager, networking devices and right click your nic. Go to properties and see what features are enabled or disabled. A common one that needs disabled is TCP Chimney that blocks winpcap after handshakes. Refrence is here You can run this to turn it off under a command prompt/terminal window. 

Those are all features of spanning tree. Disable them, study them and decide if you need them. Storm control is just throttling the specified types of traffic like multicast, broadcast. A couple examples : Use bpdu guard on ports that go to edge devices like a computer if you want them to shutdown when another switch is detected on that port that is using spanning tree. BPDU filter is how you disable spanning tree on a port. Use that only when you don't want spanning tree. Root guard needs laid out based on your topology. Disable it for now until you read up on it. Loop protect tries to detect loops coming from switches that don't have stp. It can make ports bounce up and down if a hard loop is in place and act a little "strange".

I'm curious what others do. I'm not asking for brands or models. I don't normally use less expensive switches but realize there may be some real value in that. I also get questioned on it from time to time. Maybe I need to consider it. Question... When choosing a network switch what statistics do you look at? If you have the data sheets open side by side and you didn't know the brand or model you are looking at how do you choose? Let's stick to a 48 port layer 2 NON-POE at the access layer or the list could be extensive. I don't want to get to wrapped up in layer 3 features or heavy data traversal for this. Just "normal" users. I'm trying to learn from the experts. Again, I'm not asking for brand or model recommendations. 

Danis, you have the right idea. To answer the question what is the diffrence ... FLSM can be thought of like address summarization that can't be taken apart. FLSM can be efficient at routing because it doesn't even need the whole IP to do its routing but it is an inefficient use of ip addresses since it reserves the whole block for 1 subnet only. The FLSM is usually a string of binary digits shown over the subnet number, telling the router which parts of the subnet number to look at. A binary "1" over a particular digit in the subnet number says "Pay attention to this digit." A "0" says "Ignore this digit." Allowing it to not focus on the whole IP are. Reference click here VLSM summerization is efficient also when you do route summarization by combining subnet, but allows the addresses to be broken into classless (not forced to class A, B or C) subnets. 

To set console password to still use normal local passwords (or you could set a seperate password by adding the password line and removing login local) 

Actually, it is called the Mac table by most. The command to look it up in almost all switches/devices is show mac-address table (or some form of this). Very seldom is it specified as the cam table unless the distinction between cam and t-cam needs to be made or someone is teaching the subject.
