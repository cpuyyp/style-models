There are things I much prefer in Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail: one of those things is the ability to create a Mail Rule whilst viewing a message. You would simply do so andthe new rule would be created with the dialog box and all of its options/values filled in appropriately. Am I simply missing this or did this ability simply not make the cut? Ross 

after running Netflix for the first time I am unable to listen to two of my favorite stations: $URL$ and $URL$ – although Internet Explorer has no problem playing either of those two radio stations. Firefox has no problem, however, playing Netflix – the sound comes through like a champ. Any suggestions? (I have downloaded a new Firefox and have downloaded a new Flash player – no difference, the same problem) 

Well, it appears this is a local problem,and only with Chrome: two tabs one with www. and without in IE doesn't show the prob but does in Chrome but only on this machine -- maybe a caching prob? Oh well this is quite literally my problem to solve. Thank you everyone!! 

When I am composing a message in Windows live Mail and I want to include a link I can do so easily however the link does not show up as a link when I'm composing the e-mail. After I send the e-mail and I then look at Sent Mail the desired link info shows up as an active link. I have tried using both Hyperlink from the insert toolbar and from the right-click context but hyperlink is grayed out. Is this normal or is there a fix to make it do the expected? Thank you. Ross 

I installed Lion on Partition A, so it's now 11.5 GB, after the Recovery HD partition took its share. I've tried booting holding down Option, and neither Partition A or Recovery HD show up, though both do with USB. Also, when it's plugged in with FW800, Partition A does show up in the Startup preference pane. When I select it and restart, though, it spends a long time before the Apple logo shows up, and I end up booted to my default, internal disk. I tried plugging directly into the front FW800 port, and also through other (LaCie) drives daisy chained to a rear port, and that made no difference. This is very frustrating, and would potentially make me return the drive if I can't find a solution. What could be causing this? 

I am using Outlook 2007 on Windows XP for work, and always hit to send messages. That's the shortcut in Mail.app and in MobileMe's Mail web app, and I prefer it to , which is Outlook's send mail shortcut. Spoiled by Mac OS X's ability to easily change shortcuts for any application, I've been looking for a way to change the shortcut. How can you do this? Update I ended up using TeX HeX's suggestion, AutoHotkey. The script I wrote is below: 

I recently started using a KVM at work, and now every time I switch one of my machines sounds off Windows XP's connected or disconnected device wav file. Is there a way to disable this without muting the whole system (which is what I'm currently doing)? I went to the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties (from the Control Panel) and then the Sounds tab, and couldn't clear out the sound setting. 

Recently I'm having some strange problems so I decided in place reinstall was the best answer. So I dug my original Windows 7/ultimate disk out of storage and went to reinstall. It won't let me! I get told that I am running a newer version than the about to be reinstalled version of Windows. I have been good about updating Windows through Windows Update. To reinstall process also tells me that two programs are incompatible: C-PCI speaker and advises me to update the driver and MagicISO. When I try to update the driver for the speaker, I get told I am running the newest version. I removed MagicISO. So I am unable to do the in place reinstall. Any advice? Ross 

When – and why – should one be used over the other. Sometimes: element.value = "Fred"; works and sometimes element.innerHTML = "Fred"; works how come? 

When listening to a radio station, such as $URL$ sometimes after a while I get a modal error box with a "Stream Playback Error"allowing only an OK response. What causes this and how can I fix/repair it? Ross 

I'm trying to design some buttons with a rollover behavior: changing either color or shape or both based upon hover status. My artistic skills are between zero and nil. Can you recommend a "roll your own" button designer? 

Well, I bit the bullet: I went to personalization and selected "high contrast white" and then choosing colors I thought appropriate for each Windows element. The resulting windows are certainly unique! :-) But it works! 

If you have a computer setup with iTunes reading from that NAS, then as long as that iTunes is running, you would be able to stream from that library with the Apple TV. You would need to have those movies in its library, but that shouldn't bee too big an inconvenience. 

I'm connecting to my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6) from my Windows XP work computer using both TightVNC and RealVNC, and both of those don't give me access to the Option key. So to work around that, I tried using Keyboard Viewer, but that doesn't respond to clicks through these VNC clients. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I have an iTunes LP that I want to be able to use with alternate versions of the song files (higher/lower bitrate), but the iTunes LP isn't able to play the new versions of the files. What's missing? 

The problem is that after the script runs, the "Open with" association is gone; the file opens with Console.app again. Is there any way around this in the script, like setting back the appropriate metadata after the line?

It seems conclusive at this point that this whole thing was caused by remnants of my Parallels Desktop installation (specifically some networking daemon) that didn't get uninstalled properly when I switched to VMware Fusion. Since completely removing Parallels, as described here, I haven't seen "pe-xpjalle" in my sidebar. Thanks for all of the help. 

I'm using Windows 8.1. I know that in Windows 7 I was able to adjust all (just about) all of the visual aspects of the window, and the desktop, such as the font in the title bar or even in desktop icons. Am I missing something or was that something that didn't make the upgrade? Is there an easy – as in free and without a regedit hack? Thank you. Ross 

I wish to remap an unused key into a key combination. I am a handicapped user and not of the related questions seem to answer my needs. My handicap requires me to enlarge the displayed portion of my Chrome browser. Generally speaking control+ serves my purposes well but is becoming more and more difficult for me. I wish to take some unused key(such as ) and remap that into the desired keyboard combination. Any idea how I can best accomplish this? Thanks. Ross 

I recently used Defraggler to consolidate my free space areas on my D: drive preparatory to using Disk Manager to break my drive into two areas, one as my "data area" for Windows 7 (normally on my C: drive) and to experiment around with Windows 8. The Defraggler program works so well I ran it on my C: drive and I ended up with a lot of free space both on my C: drive and my D: drive. I was very happy. And then I woke up the next day and I've got virtually no free space left, something like 8 MB on my C: drive and about 3 GB on my D: drive. I then ran Wintree (which gives a nifty graphical representation of disk usage) and found I had a large page file and a large hiberfil. So I temporarily turned off hibernate and reduced the page file size to 2000megabytes and then rebooted so that both would take effect. It had no effect on the C: drive or the D: drive. That makes no sense to me. What caused the free space on each drive to disappear, why doesn't the page file size being reduced and the hibernate file being turned off free up disk space to either the C: or the D: drive? Would it make sense to delete the two files in question and, if so, how do I go about doing that? Safe mode? Thanks. Ross 

After some poking around and searching more, I found the answer, and it lies in ordinarily invisible data and metadata. The upshot is that iTunes LP primarily references files based on their XID. In order to assign the correct XIDs to the new files in iTunes, do the following (on a Mac): 

I just turned on Google syncing in my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X) Address Book, but I'm not seeing my Address Book groups in Gmail or Google Voice. Is this supposed to be the case? Is there a way to get it to work? 

I wrote an AppleScript to accomplish the same task, but I won't accept this answer, since I still think something's wrong with Automator (or I'm not understanding something fundamental about it). This is the AppleScript for a droplet that accepts one or more folders and removes all files ending with and has been working flawlessly for months, now (on Snow Leopard and Lion). 

I've been trying to make an Automator droplet that removes files of a particular extension from a directory. My Workflow has 3 actions (when I'm not debugging): 

It's #2 that seems to be giving me problems. No matter what I do, no files ever pass through its filter. When I expand the results for Get Folder Contents and any other Finder actions, I always see files in the results. But even when I specify the most permissive filters, this action never produces anything. If you want to debug this, just insert a new action up top: Get Specified Finder Items, dropping on any directory that has any files within it - although technically the "Filter Finder Items" should also be able to return folders. Update I'm now on Lion, and seeing the exact same behavior. I also tried replacing step 2's criteria with "Name ends with 'part'" but that didn't make a difference either. I ultimately ended up writing an AppleScript that accomplished the same task (see below). 

With a lot of traveling to various hotels with free Wi-Fi I have collected a number of sites in the system tray when I clicked on the network icon. I doubt highly that I will return to these hotels and so the various sites will not be needed again. How do I remove the sites – where are they even stored? I went browsing through the registry and could not find them. (Were talking about 25-35 sites I want to blow away) any ideas/suggestions? Thank you. Ross 

This is bizarre! I have two external USB drives. For some reason the writing-to-disk red-LED was on yet the drive itself could not be found. I turned the drive off and turned it back on and wiggled the USB cable. I got the familiar USB doink sound. The disc-access light stayed off, I could access the drive normally and I can now send and receive e-mail as I used to: problem solved. Why would a loose USB cable manifest itself as a Winsock Error?!?! In any case, problem solved. Ross 

I ran an SFC on my system and it tells me that there were some "Integrity Violations" and to see the log file for more details. So I was able to open it up in Notepad, but I have no idea what I'm looking at. Anybody have an idea? Ross
