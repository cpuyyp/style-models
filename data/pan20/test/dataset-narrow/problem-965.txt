An application that has to run as root must be installed by an administrator with root access. This can be done using privilege escalation (e.g. via or equivalent). The best way to deploy the application depends on several factors but is probably best done by means of the distribution's primary package manager. This might mean providing an RPM file for download or it might mean adding a package to an Internet-accessible repository. 

There's probably a more elegant way to do it, but unless you are doing this all the time, use the hammer you have. 

Here follows the official RedGrittyBrick standards: If in doubt, I express it fully in grammatical English. For example "select 'File' from the menu bar and then choose the 'Save As' option". If necessary you can abbreviate this to "select 'Save As' from the 'File' menu". If there is a long chain of selections, use commas: "from the menu-bar select 'Format', 'Font', 'Arial', 'Regular', '10'" 

If Xprog is a GUI program which needs root perms, can you not initially invoke X by opening a terminal window and typing ? Then there's a good chance it won't prompt again for the password for . 

As slhck suggests, I would use a revision control system to record changes, whenever you check in a change you have an opportunity to type in a message stating the reason for the change. For database structure changes I use a revision control system to manage a set of SQL DDL commands "create table ...; create index ..." which I edit whenever I make a change (even if I normally do so by "alter table" etc). This then preserves a history of changes to the database structure. I use end-of-line comments in the DDL to record the purpose of the fields. If this is insufficient for you, you might consider editing your question to clarify what you need. 

To see what ports are currently in use, I would use the command to look for connections in the state 

All professional installations in offices use patch panels. Even in quite small offices. A patch panel has the solid-cored cable connected in at the rear using a punch down style of connection. At the front it has 8P8C sockets (casually called RJ45 sockets). Into these sockets you can plug Ethernet patch cables (which have stranded conductors unlike the cables used in walls) The cables used in walls is stiff which would be inconvenient for use with a switch and would need non-standard termination due to the different type of conductors. You can't easily use patch cable in walls as wall-plates (the Ethernet outlets) are typically designed for solid core cable punch-down. Staying with the standard way of wiring buildings will probably save you trouble in the future when a wall-plate needs replacing or extra cables are run by a different contractor. 

The problem is usually output buffering by your program, or more accurately by an IO library or run-time that your program uses. Specifically line-buffering. Unbuffered IO is much less efficient, which is why it is not used by default. Programming languages often have a way of specifying unbuffered output. Since it usually depends on what STDOUT is connected to it is also affected by OS environment settings. See also stdbuf 

If the data might be useful to a criminal, break open the casing until you can see the memory chips. Use a hammer to drive a nail through the chips. 

It must be safest to plug or unplug leads into the laptop when no power is present. This makes it potentially less harmful to the laptop if you somehow manage to misalign or short conductors when pushing the connector in. However, connectors are designed to prevent this sort of problem - so it should be rare unless you use an inordinate amount of force. Turning on 

It might be better looking for a PAM solution that makes use of AD. Google finds someone who alleged that the following works in /etc/groups - 

I think relocatable code predates Virtual Memory (VM). The alternative is absolute code, which has to be loaded at a specific location in physical memory (e.g. because it contains "Jump" instructions that have physical addresses as destinations) The 8086 was backwards compatible with older processors which could only address 64KB of memory using 16-bit address registers. The 8086 also had 16-bit segment registers which were taken into account (e.g. when performing a jump instruction) basically the real address = address + segment<<4. This allowed (relocatable) programs to be located anywhere in 1MB memory aligned to 16 Byte "paragraph" boundaries (the 4-bit shift in the calculation above). Such programs can only address 64KB. Obviously the OS changes the segment register appropriately on a context-switch. It seems clear that if your program manipulated the segment registers, perhaps so it could use more than 64 KB memory, it could not be relocated in this way. 

If they don't respond, I'd check any "firewall" configuration on the target PC. Firewall, Advanced, ICMP, "allow incoming icmp request" or command line 

There is no sensible way to achieve this. Your website might be viewed by PCs running a variety of different operating systems with a variety of browsers. Consider phones, pads, tablets, netbooks, TVs and other hardware platforms. You could pre-render the text as graphics images but this is troublesome to achieve in a way that is readable on both phones and dual-24" screens. It also means your text won't get indexed by search engines and so is likely to rank lower in searches. Your could use Flash but many of the same disadvantages apply. Not all platforms support Flash and some people disable it. 

So far as I know, no Linux vendor has paid to have their distribution certified - presumably none of them feel it is commercially necessary. Like others, I prefer to write "Unix/Linux" or "*nix" to be clearer (arguably). 

You say "The user can login if the website is added to the Trusted Sites security zone." This implies that mysite.com may be blocked in one of the other zones that would normally apply to . 

Since you didn't post an actual error message but just said you "can't do telnet" - we can only guess at the problem. To check if the Telnet service is runnning, log on at the Unix server console and use this command: 

Internet Protocol Suite TCP is not short for TCP/IP. TCP/IP is often used as a shorthand way of saying "The Internet Protocol Suite" and usually includes other standard protocols. When people say TCP/IP they are usually including UDP over IP (in which UDP is used instead of TCP) and a great many other protocols such as ARP, ICMP, DNS, SNMP and other application layer protocols. Application Layer Applications use Application Layer protocols such as SMTP (for email). These sit on one of two transport layer protocols - TCP and UDP. A few application layer protocols will use either or both of UDP and TCP but most are used with only one transport layer protocol. Transport Layer TCP and UDP are two transport layer protocols used in the Internet Protocol Suite. If there are others I don't know of them and any others would represent a vanishingly small specialist use. Others transport layer protocols have been defined - their usage probably represents only a small proportion of global IP traffic† Internetwork Layer Whilst it might be theoretically possible to use TCP over something other than IP, in practice TCP is always used over IP - the Internet Protocol. IP moves packets between networks (think of IP as connecting multiple LANs together) Network Interface Layer Ethernet is just the most popular family of low-level link-layer protocols on which TCP/IP is carried, but TCP/IP is also widely used over ATM and others. 

If the remote host is Linux, use inside the telnet session to get a list of supported values for this setting at the remote host. 

Probably not. Unless they added one in Win 8 I recently purchased a new Pc with Win 7, the manufacturer bundled a third party shredder application. I infer that either there isn't one as standard (and I've never heard of one) or (less likely?) that the manufacturer added some unnecessary bloatware without the usual sliver of justification. It's hard to prove a negative though. 

The signal levels for amplifier input ("line input" level) are much lower than the signal levels for headphones or loudspeakers. A line-in connection also has a much higher impedance (e.g. 100 Ω) than typical headphones (32 Ω) or loudspeakers (8 Ω). By feeding unattenuated loudspeaker level signals to an amplifier's line-level inputs you can cause clipping of the signal (especially in louder passages). The line levels used to interconnect professional audio equipment also differs from that used to interconnect consumer audio equipment. Unless you match these up you are likely to degrade the audio signal quite badly. Turn the volume down at the laptop. 

I don't know but for most commands or programs multiple command line options can be specified using spaces to separate them thus: 

That would cause Putty to act as if you had pressed F5 and it will then send an appropriate sequence of characters (an Escape Sequence) to the server. 

(where ^[ is the escape character (hex 1b decimal 27)) Remote diagnosis of printing problems is hard. Get a cooperative person at the site to use the printer's control panel to print a test page and to print out the settings. They can then use an old-fashioned fax machine to send them to you. The n in E260dn implies network-connected. Can other PCs print to the printer? If you are using VNC, you will be able to telnet to the printer and get it to show configuration settings. 

In my experience, no. If the battery leaks corrosive fluid over other parts it would likely cause damage. I suspect this sort of leakage is unlikely. If it happened you would be able to see some damage. 

The ideal way to do this is to have the routers create the VPN tunnel for you. I've done this with entry-level Cisco routers but it seems your routers don't have the ability to act as VPN endpoints. You might check whether you can use an Open-Source Router Firmware on your routers, or consider purchasing alternative routers that do have this feature. 

When you need to segregate traffic into two or more groups without separating the physical infrastructure (chiefly switches) into two or more physical groups. 

I will assume the former. At the simplest level you can encrypt the body of the message, and, if necessary, convert to a suitable encoding such as base64 before you invoke the mail command. 

If you don't know the fully qualified domain name and have no way to open a session then you'll have to visit the computer or enlist the help of someone near the computer. 

Are you sure the characters are in the font? Browsers search other fonts to find missing characters - therefor you cant use browsers to test font contents. You can't trust applications either - here I am using an Arabic font in Notepad to show Chinese characters that I strongly suspect are not in the Arabic font. It seems to me the application (or the underlying Windows libraries) are searching other fonts to provide the missing character. 

(update) Windows Vista onwards Notepad has now adopted the strategy first seen in web-browsers - if the character does not exist in the current font, find a font that does contain that character and, for that character only, use the other font. Therefore if you have different additional fonts on one computer, it can behave differently to other computers (even though the OS is the same). "Wrong" Arial I don't know the algorithm used but it seems possible that if you have a corrupted or much smaller Arial Unicode that lacks some characters, Notepad may believe the font contains a character it does not. An Arial font of 3,395 KB is not what I would expect on Windows 7. Perhaps installing some application has replaced the default font with one that is faulty in some way? Additional "bad" font Alternatively Notepad might search a different, recently added, font for the missing character before looking at Arial Unicode. If this different font claims to contain the character but does not (e.g. incorrect layout tags, Notepad could fail to display the character
