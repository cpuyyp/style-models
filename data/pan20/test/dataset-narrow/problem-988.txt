This question isn't so much a how-to related to Outlook and IMAP but rather related to nuances of Outlook when doing IMAP email. In Outlook 2010 we have just a single account set up via IMAP. No other accounts. The first point of confusion for folks is that in the account hierarchy on the left there's the "Outlook Data File" section - it shows up on top. The Inbox, Junk-Email and some other things are NOT the same as the respective folders under the IMAP account section. Since the "Outlook Data File" piece is on top, folks go to that Inbox (as well as other folders) and get confused when they see no mail. The Outlook Data File section does not show if I have an Exchange account set up along side the IMAP account. Any way to hide the section or put it below the other one? Related, can the various sections on the left (Favorites, Outlook Data File, the IMAP account) be set to default to open vs. closed? The other non-IMAP vs. IMAP area of confusion is the "Junk E-mail" folder. With an Exchange account, Outlook does a nice job of detecting spam and putting it in Junk E-mail. With IMAP accounts it catches nothing. Should this folder work the same for IMAP? Note that the IMAP server is not GMail, in case that makes a difference. 

I have an Apple G5 with OSX 10.3 and I'm trying to upgrade to 10.5. I'm getting the error: "Missing bill of materials". I'm relatively new to Macs so I may not be providing all the relevant information here. 

For simple images with relatively straight and simple borders, it's easy; you hover over the image and you get the "+" arrow. But for smaller, more intricate images with many sides, thin borders or perhaps transparency it's often madness as you move your cursor all over the image struggling to find the teenie little spot that Word deems is selectable. Is there some means of enabling the display of "handles" (maybe wrong term) around images before you select them, so you can see the selectable spots without hunting and pecking for them? 

I want to look for duplicate blocks of text within the same document. Tools like WinMerge and Beyond Compare don't seem to do this. Does anyone know of a utility that can do this? 

TrueCrypt can be configured to dismount volumes upon logoff but is it possible to dismount volumes when you hibernate windows? 

I just upgraded my Windows 7 installation on a Lenovo Thinkpad W500 to Windows 8 Pro. Following the upgrade my cursor frequently does not respond to finger movements on the Synaptics trackpad. It either takes multiple attempts or a change of finger direction to get the cursor moving. The problem only happens when starting from rest; movements in progress are not impacted. Mouse and TrackPoint movements work fine. I've confirmed that it is not a sensitivity issue; the problem is consistent regardless of sensitivity settings and the firmness of my motion. Finally, following the problem I downloaded the most recent Synaptics drivers from the Lenovo site but the problem remains the same. Update: I am able to reproduce the problem consistently as follows: 

Bookmarks and page content should be full text searchable Maintain an archive indefinitely Distinguish between what's read vs. unread Bookmarked page content is cleaned up, e.g. ads eliminated, unnecessary html removed, pages better formatted for reading 

Synaptics Touchpads have a feature called "Edge swiping" that supports a series of gestures for moving your finger in a continuous motion starting off the trackpad and sliding on to it. Windows 8 apparently enables this automatically (at least it did in the case of my Windows 7 in-place upgrade). Given that the trackpad on my laptop is relatively small, the edge swipe region is a large portion of the trackpad area; in my case, it's roughly 1/4 of the vertical area of the device. Given that my initial finger placement much of the time occurred in this area, the trackpad would interpret this as an edge swipe gesture rather than a normal cursor navigation, so the cursor would appear to be stuck. I disabled edge swipe to resolve the problem. 

I'd like to narrow the icons for currently running programs in the Taskbar. I'd like to achieve a greater density in that area but I don't want to group similar items. Is this possible? I've some up short when Googling. 

I trialed an Outlook add-in that had a number of different functions, one of which allowed you to send the same email to multiple recipients at the same time, without doing it as a bcc. For example, if I wanted to send the same email to Tom, Dick and Harry without having to write 3 emails, the add-in let me specify the names and the email would go to the 3 of them. In my Sent Items folder would be 3 emails each addressed to the respective person. The add-in might have started with an S, or an R, but I don't remember. 

I found a free tool called ReliefJet Essentials which does this. See the "Unstuck Outbox Messages" section of $URL$ 

Like many others, I have a process for bookmarking web pages to read later. My requirements for web page bookmarking are: 

Thunderbird 3 will automatically update/refresh individual IMAP folders when you switch to them (e.g. click on them). None of my "Check this folder for new messages" options are checked. You can update all folders at once by clicking File, Offline, Download/Sync Now... or File, Offline, Work Offline. The former option asks if you want to go offline following the sync. When you come back from Offline, the sync happens again. 

In OneNote options I've set a particular default font. Then I selected all text in a particular notebook section and change it to the new font. However, whenever I insert a new line in that existing body of text, it reverts to a font that isn't my default. Almost as if the incorrect "style" information is somehow embedded in the existing text, even though the text itself is the correct font. How can I resolve this? 

I did a file/directory comparison of the user profile to an existing known good profile and found that ntuser.dat wasn't in the broken one. It's not clear to me how the user hive was deleted as part of the steps above. 

I'm running Skype and other voice chat apps on a Lenovo ThinkPad W500 without a headset; I'm using only the laptop's built-in mic and speakers. According to the people I speak with, the audio quality is perfect, even when I turn my head away from the PC. I've other apps, e.g. Oovoo and it's similarly good. My past experiences have always been horrible - a feedback loop caused by the speaker sound getting picked up from the mic, low audio volume, etc. I thought Skype might be doing some fancy schmancy noise reduction magic but as I said above, the quality is very good even when using other apps. I'm curious why the quality of my audio (as heard by the other person) isn't horrible in this configuration? 

I run Outlook 2010 against Exchange and will continue to do so. However on an ongoing basis I want to sync emails from Outlook to my Google Apps account. Essentially I just want to sync my emails to Google Apps but I have no plans to leave Exchange. I do the Google Apps Sync for Outlook install and then run "Set up a Google Apps Sync user" which prompts me to authenticate to my Google Apps account, asks me if I want to import emails, calendar, etc. and then makes me create a new profile. If I import my emails at this time, they are obviously pulled from my original profile. When complete, all my emails show in my new Outlook profile and in Google Apps, just like they should. But moving forward I want to continue using Exchange which means using my original profile, and by definition this profile isn't sync'd. So given this, how can I keep working against my Exchange-based email and sync those changes to gmail? 

By "Search programs and files" text box I'm referring to the text entry area you get when you hit the Windows key and/or click the Start button. I'd love it if this text box could have a must recently used (MRU) history list similar to the Start/Run dialog. Is it possible to configure this? Regards 

When I started listening to podcasts over 4 years ago, I noticed that a number of them included "section marks" (aka chapter marks) in the audio timeline which allowed you to jump from section to section in a single click. The podcast producer would use these sections to break up the podcast into logical chunks. At the time, I didn't believe this functionality was specific to a certain type of device and/or file format and/or producer. I don't see these anywhere now. Would like to have them back as they were a useful feature. Any ideas on this? 

I'm using Outlook 2010 and Exchange 2007. Does the Outlook 2010 (or any version) "Deleted Items" folder have any special traits beyond: 

I'm running Outlook 2010 in Cached Exchange mode against an Exchange 2007 server. I understand that disabling Cached Exchange Mode removes the local cache and makes me operate directly against the server, but when going from cached exchange mode to non cached, does it delete the OST file, empty it, or other? 

Microsoft periodically publishes an Excel (how ironic) spreadsheet listing the SKUs / part numbers of all of their software. It has the sku number, product description, etc. (The spreadsheet is so large that rumor has it Microsoft had to expand the number of rows Excel could handle just for this one document.) 

I have 2 mail profiles - one profile has a single Exchange 2010 account and the other has a single IMAP account. I want to open an instance of Outlook for each. I execute for the Exchange profile and for the IMAP profile and the result is that I get 2 instances of Outlook each with the MyExchangeProfile. In fact, whichever profile I load first is always the one that gets loaded no matter what profile I specify on separate executions. 

I'm using Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 against an IMAP server (the problem exists across many, like Gmail, you name it). Outlook lets you set your Outlook "Sent" folder to map to the IMAP server's Sent folder (the other choice is to map your Outlook Sent to your Personal Folders Sent) - this is good. When you send a message from Outlook and then look in the sent folder of the IMAP server (e.g. from a different client or from a browser), the messages are there. This is the behavior I want. Outlook does NOT support the same behavior for Drafts and Trash. In both cases, items deleted (or Drafts saved) in Outlook go in to Outlook's local folders and do NOT show on the IMAP server's Trash or Drafts folders. Same problem in reverse. Thunderbird on the other hand does support the proper mapping of Drafts, Sent and Trash. I expected this to be IMAP-specific but it appears to be client specific. What does Outlook implement it this way and is there a workaround? 

I'm looking to remote control a PC that's at our company behind a firewall. LogMeIn Free and the free version of GoToMyPC do the trick but they're not licensed for corporate use. It's important that the solution not require poking an outside --> inside hole in the firewall. I'd like the same or similar architecture as LogMeIn and GoToMyPC where both the remote client and the PC to be controlled initiate outbound connections to the respective service's broker which arbitrates the connection. Any recommendations? 

I'd like to have the "All Programs" menu in the Vista/Windows 7 Start Menu behave like it does in Windows XP, without changing to the "Classic" start menu. Specifically, I'd like the All Programs menu to expand vertically (the more programs are on the menu the higher it goes) and horizonally (as submenus expand) unbounded by the Start Menu dialog as it currently does. I find it more difficult to visualize the set programs installed with the current view. Switching back to the Classic menu would do this but then I'd lose the other goodies such as iterative search. Any ideas? Thanks
