I'd actually forgotten about this, I'm thinking of investigating Microsoft's Lync Server since it's new enterprise voice features cover a lot of what i'm looking for. 

EDIT Now you have the right port it appears to be a protocol problem. I would verify that the proxy_ajp_module is loading correctly: 

ok it would appear the problem is resolved after uninstalling KB968389 (ref) and then reinstalling again. this has had me stumped for a few months, i would never have guessed it was NTLM related... to quote: 

I use the same router in a few locations, where the port doesn't need to change I used NAT>Open Ports to do the same thing. I also changed the port of the management interface (even though it was disabled) to remove the possibility of a conflict. EDIT: Also check for a software firewall on the server hosting the application :) 

Assuming you mean Oracle VirtualBox VM, have a read of this section of the manual: $URL$ Essentially by using NAT, your VM's will need to be on the subnet chosen by your VirtualBox installation. VirtualBox has a DHCP server which will allocate addresses automatically which is why you can access the internet from your VMs. AD/DNS will need to be on a static address on this subnet, not DHCP. I would start by pinging the IP address and not the name too. 

I'm not sure there is a partition number as such. A list of the WMI classes (e.g. LogicalDisk) that you can inspect is here: MSDN If you're using Windows 7 the Powershell alternative is: 

on the command line will give you the version and build number. For 2008 R1/R2 in particular you can always check the build number: $URL$ Although it's a bit harder to detect 2003 R1/R2, not sure if you want to? EDIT: If you want build number or a plain text version number then you can also check the registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion 

Transport rule would do it, it is ridiculous, but any question deserves an answer. I would just add an exception for when the email body contains the disclaimer text. There's enough flexibility in the transport rules to do whatever you want. 

I believe it can: $URL$ The enterprise voice features require a 'Plus CAL'. There's not a great deal of information around on how Lync connects to SIP trunks or PSTN gateways though. 

Andrew is right the instructions are correct the server.xml is what you need to change. If you need to know if you're looking in the right place just check where the exe is as referenced in the Windows service then simply ../conf/server.xml. 

Both are great. I would use nginx personally as you’re not running multiple back ends from that perspective (from what I understand) so you don’t need haproxy on that side of things. Just have nginx setup with ssl and proxy pass :) 

It does work, in the sense that you can achieve setting up raid... however there will be zero redundancy and completely invalidates the point of having it. Here’s my advice: 

If a system has snoopy installed (which logs commands in auth.log) then it would be retrievable from there but also bash history would have it in. Also - where is your script located as it could probably be just read from within the script 

Looking at your requirements I don’t believe it has to be the most expensive server you can find. I think you’d be very comfortable with a 16Gb RAM with maybe a low level Xeon or even desktop grade processor such as an i5. I’d suggest maybe some SSD storage to give you that quicker access, doesn’t have to be high volume necessarily and you could probably just archive off to some regular HDDs. NGINX is my personal preference, I’d suggest springing for a decent network card though, but that might be useless dependant on the quality of your networking and subsequent hardware I.e don’t get a 10G card if you can’t make use of it. In summary, my suggestion is: 

Check the terms of service. In fairness you have no legal obligation as far as I’m aware to justify your licensing to them.. however we are not lawyers and for accurate advice you should really contact some legal professionals. I don’t believe they have any right to dictate you install software however this may well be in the terms of service. With regards to the admin access.. don’t they have that already if it’s managed hosting? You should contact the company’s help desk to ensure they actually sent that email BEFORE making any action. A simple who is against your ip will probably reveal who owns the IP and subsequently your hosting provider is and then start a social engineering attempt against you 

Configure NGINX to point to that page for genuine 404 errors. Once that’s done, when you want to redirect your app in places just redirect them to a bogus page A previous answer said it correctly, when you’re pulling your 404 page at it’s genuine place, it will return a 200, because you’ve requested a page that does exist. 

transfer the FSMO roles to the new server, then demote the old server using dcpromo again you may also want to check the replication status of your new server using 

In terms of schema updates does 'Exchange 2007 SP3' and 'Server 2008' do the same thing? I'd like to add a 2008r2 DC to an existing 2003-level forest (which requires 2008 adprep on the forest) and I've not yet had the need to apply SP3 to Exchange (which brings 2008 compatibility to Exchange). Domain functional level will stay at 2003, as all my existing DCs are 2003. 

You can also force the Outlook clients to update the address book with the Send/Recieve -> Download Address Book option. 

not answering the question directly, but why not export the mailbox to a PST file (using Exchange Management Shell) then disable the exchange account? 

service.bat which must be updated with your chosen name the lock file must be different, since each service will detect the other service's lock file otherwise the directory paths must be different throughout the file. 

Active Directory domains don't maintain 'session state', it's just a directory, you won't be able to retrieve a list of logged in users. You can get the last login date of each user but would require a script to check every domain controller in your domain (script link). 

The port is already in use. You may need to use another or find out what's running on 8080 and stop it. 

Have you got the right port there? There are two different connectors in the JIRA server XML. The HTTP one is on 8080 by default. The AJP one is normally 8009 by default: 

I've been playing with VoIP IP PBX solutions for a few months, but I'm trying to find a solution that will allow for the following: 

There are some relevant DSN commands on the cmdlet (TechNet) and in particular . This exchange blog post explains the functionality a bit better. This will be for Exchange 2007 SP1 RU4 onwards. I've not had chance to try it out, but hope it helps. 

no it doesn't apply the increased complexity requirement for current passwords, it will when they expire/reset. $URL$ 

Another alternative to robocopy could be the File Server Migration tool. I'ev used this to migrate FS data from NT4 to 2003 in the past. Not only does it migrate permissions but it will migrate your shares. 

That does indicate your drive had a problem but it doesn’t necessarily indicate the drive is failing and needs replacing. That is actually saying that the drive has noticed a problem and will try to correct it. If it succeeds... happy days. If not then you’ll need to replace the drive. Offline uncorrectable value is the one you should be worried about. If that one is anything other than 0, then it’s time to replace the drive. Additionally, if you’re using mdraid check it’s not degrading the array as that might cause you boot problems tl;dr don’t worry. If it graduates to offline uncorrectable then worry. If you have raid then you can sit back and relax. 

If you don’t see a block of unallocated space then your drive is faulty. Before submitting an RMA ensure that your raid card firmware is completely up to date, have enough power (I.e your server PSU is powerful enough to support all your hardware) etc as they’ll make you jump through them hoops before they actually do anything anyway 

I’d personally go for the 4 x 8TB option. That way you can have it in RAID10. Granted your rebuild times will be longer but 16TB of redundant storage and not losing anything to parity isn’t bad 

Surely you could just check the password used by the 900 applications in order to determine what it is? Have you checked if they’re stored in plain text? E.g web.config sql connection string? Also, could you not setup a new user and password and deploy it to the 900 applications? I know if I had 900 applications running with hard coded user details I would have a deployment system setup.. 

Try installing the WordPress plugin ‘wordfence’ I use it a lot as it not only tracks live traffic you can block IPs it will also send you emails about missing security updates for plugins (including itself) and the entire WordPress installation. It can also scan the WP files and let you know for dodgy content. You can also manually run head and tail commands on Linux against WordPress files or grep them all, you want to look out for any base64 in the files. That part was more for the clean up, although wordfence will also identify things like this too 

You need to install AD DS roles on the windows server and from there promote it to a domain controller. You can then tell workstations to join the domain and manage logins from AD as you have previously. DHCP isn’t tied to using the domain - or else you’d get no Addresses now! Two separate things, it’s just centralising them in one place. You can move some or all computers to the Domain as you see fit 

have you created a separate batch file for each service? have you changed all references to the lock files and directories this file references? you can create a copy of service.bat and use this to install the second service, but there are several references to: 

This has both and properties. Otherwise I think you'd have to get it from a fqdn/DN as squillman suggests. 

Other's have hinted at this, but under EMC (not ADUC) you can go to the properties of the mailbox to remove it from the GAL correctly ("Hide from Exchange address lists"), but also to check which OU the user is in: 

Active Directory Migration Tool (google admt 3.2) will do a lot of legwork for you in terms of user/computer account migration (including deploying agents to remotely reboot computers to join a new domain!). You just need to ensure an forest-level trust is in place. As for the scripts (how many??), i'd just take a copy of them and redeploy them on the new domain. 

as well as windirstat as suggested by bot403, i also use jdiskreport for graphical representations of which folders are taking up your space actually i'd say that 10GB is probably about right for a vanilla Win2008r2 Standard Edition install 

I would probably leave the DNS (primary and secondary) pointing at the VPS provider's nameservers and just update your DNS records (www = w.x.y.z) with whoever hosts your domain name. Since you only have 1 IP address assigned I don't think you intend to host your own DNS nameservers. Better just remove the DNS role from the server. 

I think you will need to enable Named Pipes in Configuration Manager and restart the services. Also start the SQL Browser service. 

Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1 ... I probably wouldn't go for VMWare Server for production use. MS Virtual PC would run, but Virtual Server is better. Linux Guest Support for Virtual Server 2005 R2 

You can add an additional email address to the Owner's account once the exchange account is disabled to catch any new mail. 

looks like this was intended behaviour, but a workaround is shown here essentially you build a variable containing a list of the folders you want to exclude... 

To answer your last question you should be able to verify the NetBios name manually by checking the Configuration section and then Directory Partitions in ADSIEdit:
