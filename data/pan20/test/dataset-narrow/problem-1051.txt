Are there similar software or alternative to Adobe Edge? I'm looking for a software where you can animate your html elements visually or using a GUI and then it will export in HTML and using javascript(jQuery if possible). If there's none yet, I hope the jQuery (or other JS framework) community would develop a small app where you can just drag html elements, and animate it visually. 

I'll be re-install my Operating system in my desktop, It would be a clean version of windows7. I wonder if there's a software that lets me install my application automatically or an easier way to install all my old application. I still have all my installer sitting in my hard drive. I just need a software to automate it, but not to hard to configure it. What would be the process that you would recommend if you're in my shoes. I'm still using my old windows 7 here in my desktop. But before I format my old drives, I would want to get your suggestions and opinions. I also stumbled on a cool software "Windows Post-Install Wizard" But the problem of this is I'm having hard time to configure it. Thanks! 

Second, to simulate key strokes, you need . If you do not yet have it installed, run . You can use to type text, or to simulate special keys: 

For to work, the actual sound driver must be loaded (check index 0 in ), and the module must be loaded. 

Make it executable (), and run it (). Now, pressing E-5 or C-4 should have some effect. Change or add lines of the form to do whatever you want. 

FireWire has features than cannot be easily emulated over a bus like USB. A USB-to-FireWire adapter, if somebody would manage to build one, would probably not be able to get 1394b speeds, and would likely cost much more than a complete new notebook with a built-in FireWire (or Thunderbolt) controller. 

You could put the entire command into a shell script and run that with , or start another shell inside : 

Running will save all mixer settings into ; will restore them. You can use the option to use another file; remove all entries that you don't want to change. Alternatively, you can use the tool to change mixer controls individually. 

I'm not good doing network on my computer. I've been searching on the web and youtube for tutorials on how to properly connect/share files from desktop to laptop using wireless connection. Here's the scenario: I bought a D-Link router and plugged my internet source and then from my router it connects to my Destop (Lan 1) using RJ-45 and a cable. The internet is currently working well for my Desktop and Laptop. In my laptop I can access the internet using wireless connection and my desktop it uses a cable from the router. The Problem: I've been trying to setup a homegroup (both in Laptop and Desktop) but I can't find any of them to connect. I also can't find any of them in my network. I'm guessing that my Laptop and Desktop are not properly configured to connect to each other. It just connect to the internet... What I'm trying to achieve: I need to share files from my Desktop to Laptop or vise versa. I don't know how to do this, any tutorials online would be good. I also don't want to use DropBox or similar services... My System: My Desktop and Laptop is using Windows 7 Ultimate. Please advice. Thanks! 

Your OS has no built-in mechanism for this; you need to install some separate MIDI-to-keyboard software (e.g., Bome MIDI Translator). 

The USB specification defines three synchronization modes for isochronous endpoints: synchronous, asynchronous, and adaptive. Nobody uses synchronous. For playback endpoints, adapative means that the device runs at exactly the speed at which the PC decides to sends data; asynchronous means that the device tells the PC how fast it should send data (this is done through a second endpoint in the other direction). An asynchronous device typically has three isochronous endpoints: one asynchronous output endpoint for playback samples, one input endpoint for playback frequency feedback data, and one asynchronous input endpoint for capture samples. It might also have interrupt and bulk endpoints for mixer control, MIDI, and vendor-specific stuff. The USB audio driver prefers an adaptive endpoint over an asynchronous endpoint, if possible. (But I don't know of any current device that actually has different endpoint types for the same output; the C-Media CM66xx chips certainly don't.) So if you want to run multiple devices at the same speed, you cannot affect anything with software configuration; you must use devices that you know support adaptive mode. 

Is there anyway I can do automation on the background while doing other activities in my Laptop? I'm using Keyboard Maestro with recorded event, like mouse interaction to a form and looping from a datasource. If I'm doing the automation I cannot do other stuff in my laptop because my mouse and other actions are being utilized by the Keyboard Maestro automation process. Is there I can split my window (like virtual machine) without installing a new Mac OSX? probably just a small software that will virtually give me an option have 2 windows running without interfering the other one. or else i think I'll have to install Mac OSX in my VMWare just to run the automation process. Any thoughts? Thank You. 

My Hard Disk Drive just got corrupted due to electricity fluctuation. When I plug my Western Digital Elements, It ask me if I want to format it or not... I can't see my files or even the capacity of my disk from it's properties. Is there any solution you would suggest? looking for a software that can give me access to my files. I just need to copy it then I can retire my Drive and will buy a new one... Thanks! 

Using "Checkout" is correct, but you have to select the directory you want instead of the repository root. 

The driver is a bridge between ALSA sequencer ports and OSS MIDI ports. To get loopback ports (that send back what they receive), use the driver. It's loaded automatically; you already have the "Midi Through Port". 

The devices are just for compatibility with the legacy OSS interface; the actual ALSA devices are in . To show incoming MIDI messages, run with the port name shown by . To show the raw MIDI bytes, run with the port name shown by . 

According to the datasheets (KVR16N11H/8, KVR16N11/8), the KVR16N11/8 has exactly the same height, so as far as the specs are concerned, there isn't any difference at all. The KVR16N11/8 datasheet is four months older, so I guess the H is a newer revision. 

You want one software channel with two hardware channels, so you have to do the mapping in the opposite direction: 

Your hardware does not support capturing its output; once the data has gone into the actual playback device, it's gone. You need to use some software that duplicates the audio data before it is written to the hardware. I'd suggest using PulseAudio; there you can simply select one of its outputs as capture source: 

Is there an an efficient way of copying selected files to a new folder? I have a list of files I want to copy (including the path), I'm just not sure what command I can run to achieve my goal. I need to make a copy of some of the files, and preserve it's original directory structure. The selected files have varying location, some resides in the root folder while some are nested in sub folders. Source: 

Do you know any software or compilations that you recommend to handle drivers and codecs for newly formated computer? I am having problem gathering drivers and codecs when I format my computer or other's computer because we frequently misplace it's original drivers. I need an offline solution that doesn't need internet. Same for as the codec, when formating computer we frequently lost our codecs, are there codec packs you know that you would like to recommend? P.s. I had tried driver bot but it's only good when your online, I'm looking for a complete package that has all the driver to most common hardware (eg. Monitor, Sound, etc). Thanks! 

DOS programs expect to access the hardware directly. Emulating such direct hardware accesses would require some kind of virtualization (DOSBox or a VM), or that the actual hardware has built-in support for emulation (modern chipsets typically can do this to allow to redirect PS/2 keyboard/mouse accesses to USB, but not for anything else). 

The 6fire has its own internal wavetable synthesizer, so the "DMX 6fire Wavetable" port certainly is wrong. To send MIDI data to the daughterboard, you have to use the port that is routed to the daughterboard, either "MPU-401" or "6Fire MIDI". 

Please note that not all special keys are handled correctly by . And Ctrl+Alt+Del is handled very specially by the kernel and probably does not work when simulated; try running instead of . Finally, tie everything together with a script. Put this into a text file, for example, : 

This is not a valid key; backslashes () are not allowed in the Base64 encoding. Furthermore, if it were valid, it would be an unencrypted private key; publishing it on a website would defeat its purpose â€¦ 

I'm really curious of those software that promise you to make your RAM bigger and faster. But before I try it, I have to get your thoughts on it, Does the software really make your RAM run faster or boost your RAM? I just know that when you buy a physical RAM (eg. 2GB) and thats it. now if you wan't to make your computer run faster you would have to add/upgrade some of the hardware. Please share your Ideas. Thanks! 

Are there software you know that can copy images from a DVD? now the problem is there images in the DVD that are corrupt that I won't force to copy, If the software can recover the file and copy it that would be cool, If it cannot then skip the file. The dvd is kinda large and I don't want to sit and wait there. I want the DVD do the decision, If it can recover then recover if it cannot, then skip. And do you know other solution copying corrupt files? thanks! 

You can use the plugin to copy the sample data to multiple virtual capture devices. Put something like this into your or , and use as device name in both applications: 

The plugin works only for playback devices. To be able to have a device that uses for playback and does something else for capturing, you have to use the asym plugin to define different plugins for playback/capture. 

This looks as if your hardware does not support mono playback. To downmix to both channels, try something like this: 

There is only a single control device for each card, so it is no plugin that allow to change what controls are shown. You have to manually select the playback/capture device in alsamixer. 

You have two sound "cards": the HDMI output of the GPU, and all the analog stuff. The HDMI controller happens to be found first, so it's the default device. If you wanted to use it, a device name like or would work. To make the "PCH" device the default one, 

I found my answer and it's Chrom Dev Tool Autosave $URL$ It's an awesome way to edit css and js on the fly without leaving your browser. A short intro $URL$ 

Notice that when i downloaded the images, i am only interested in placing them in the secondary directory ("vegetable" and "pets") and didn't include the first directory anymore... Is there any software that let me do this? I have a MACOSX and Also have a Windows 7, So any would do for me. Thank You. 

Can anyone suggest a good software that lets you download file urls or image urls and put it on an organize structure you specify. let say i have a bunch of images to download that is structure like this. 

[my process] in [Set1] I enter "bridge.hisdomain.com" in the hostname of PuTTy. after I hit Open It will open a terminal and will asked for a username. thats where I provide my [Set1] username and password. Ounce login, I then perform [Set2] Details. I will use "ssh username@123.456.789.123" after I enter it, It will then asked for my password. from there, when I do "DIR" in command prompt I will see al my files there. I wanted to download a directory there to my local drive but I am not familiar with the commands. I would like to access it just by using FileZilla or similar. And I've also tried this but I don't know what I'd miss, because It didn't work for me. I downloaded a .pem file from the [set1] because I can also access it using a regular FTP (filezilla) and I then converted that .pem file to .ppk. right now I'm kinda confuse what login info I should use for my FileZilla to access the server. I had success in loging via FTP using [Set1] login details. But my files aren't there. I only saw some folders and a .pem file. I can't login to my Filezilla using [set2] details. I tried FTP and SFTP. I also added the .ppk file in the settings of my fileZilla. But I had no success in loging in. any ideas what did I miss?
