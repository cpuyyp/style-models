Songbird can do this with an add-on. Edit: Looks like this only works for the iPod, but not the iPhone/iPod Touch 

I don't think this is possible. However, depending on their complexity, you might be able to vectorize the still images (either by hand or by using something like Vector Magic), and then scale them up as needed. 

There do appear to be programs you can install to get this functionality. Classic Menu for Office 2007 is one, and although not free, does have a free trial period. 

This is a gross overstatement. My laptop does not have a free-fall sensor, and I move it all the time while it is operating. It would be bad for it to fall from any significant height, but "moving" is not a problem. 

Network Connections, added connection. Selected Mobile broadband Selected my country, and network (vodafone) Selected Mobile Internet (Postpaid) I've called the guy who gave me the stick, and he told me it's Postpaid (anyway, I've tried also prepaid, not working). Just got to general, and checked Automatically connect to this network when it is available, and saved. 

This should mean, to filter all the links (disable all of them), and enable only those that contain /web/20011209181356/$URL$ The command downloads just the homepage, so I guess I'm doing something wrong. If somebody has an idea of how to get this one done (except from building my own scraper - tried to avoid this in order to save time), even with a different tool that I can use from command line and also works on windows. 

In addition to using the windows+arrow keys, I highly suggest trying out GridMove. It's a fantastic window management program if you have multiple monitors (or even one large one). 

"Official" response from Apple (from here) on why gift cards cannot be used to purchase apps in Canada: 

Resize the partition on my HDD (using GParted) to 105GB in order to fit on the new SSD Make an image of my HDD (using clonezilla) and save to an external hard drive Create a partition on the SSD larger than 105GB Restore the image of my HDD to the SSD using clonezilla 4. Attempt to boot from new SSD 

Looks like you're not alone. That thread includes discussion of a program that may be able to control the brightness, although that's with the ambient sensor turned off. It looks like they limit the max brightness to preserve battery life. 

I don't have any /dev/modem file or folder, and also no file starting with the name ttyUSB. Third thing I've took out of the USB port the stick, and run ls -1 /dev > before.txt. Plugged in the stick, and runned again. The diff before.txt after.txt got me this: 

I have Ubuntu 13.04 and I bought yesterday a Vodafone USB stick for internet connection. I am located in Romania. This is what I've did: First Thing 

Here's an example Here is an archive link: $URL$ In other to download the links that I need, I am using this command: 

Any suggestions ? The usb works fine on windows. I've tried to install it's own software (windows application) with wine, but also got an error. UPDATE: I've found a command that tells me which /dev/* is my Vodafone Stick. sudo lsblk 

Edit: in my .bashrc file, I have the following: . Additionally, executing from the shell fails with the same error message, even though works perfectly well. 

This isn't specific to your hardware, but Tom's Hardware has a "Beginner's Guide For WaterCooling Your PC" which may be helpful. Looks like it does a good job of covering the basics and then some - should be helpful in guiding you toward choosing the right components for your specific application. 

This depends on the version of OneNote. For 2007, you can "print" into OneNote. There isn't any import functionality for 2003, though. 

I'm trying to use todotxt in Cygwin on Windows 7. However, when I do I get an error message: . However, works just fine: 

When you press the Up arrow, you scroll through all those commands. I've read it somewhere before (and done it in my work PC) that you can set-up BASH such that when I first type then press the Up arrow, it would only scroll through all commands in history that starts with "p" ( and ). When I type then press Up, then it would only scroll through all commands starting with "mysql". I'd like to set my laptop to use this, but I can't find the instructions again. 

I'd like to upload a handful of HTML files that I want to replace an existing Google Site. I know I can edit the HTML for each page in Google Sites, but I can't just upload my HTML files or even copy-paste them. I have CSS files and JS files as well. Is it even possible in Google Apps? Or do I have to use a 3rd-party web host? 

Instructions for creating a macro to do this for you. Alternatively, can you right-click, copy, and paste in an image editor? This page also has instructions for opening the image in a web browser to save. 

I have a Sony Vaio laptop running Vista 32-bit. I'd like to get it to a clean installation of Vista for the purposes of selling it (i.e. rid it of any data). I do not have a Windows installation disc (thanks, Sony!), and the computer does not have a recovery partition. I tried creating a recovery disc by downloading and burning a DVD with the image here, but when I booted from that disc and tried to "install", go an error message ("cannot open the required file D:\Sources\Install.wim. The File does not exist." Any suggestions? 

I want to use john (I hope it's possible) to create all possible combinations of the set A,B,C,D..,Z with fixed 8 length, and distinct letters! Meaning: ABCFGRTH QPFLDMRB etc... I've tried it with some backtracking algorithms, but they didn't gave me the right results. Do you guys have any ideas ? 

I am trying to use httrack to download an entire webarchive from archive.org. The idea is to download only the archive links (as many as possible), but only the links that are really from the archive not from the current website. In other words, I want to download only the links that contain this pattern: 

Fourth thing If I run lsusb I get this Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

I know this does not directly answer your question, but one option is to encourage groups that use mailing lists to move to a forum/bulletin board format. 

Alternatively, you could make Windows think it's using Notepad, when in fact it's using Notepad++. Basically you rename notepad++.exe to notepad.exe and place the executable in the appropriate directories. Edit: more extensive instructions 

I have an HP dv5t laptop running Windows 7 64 bit with an Acer H235H monitor connected to it via an HDMI cable. The monitor has built-in speakers, which are a huge improvement over the laptop's speakers. However, when I want to use headphones, right now, I have to connect them to the laptop, then right-click the sound icon in the task bar, select Playback Devices, right click the monitor, and disable it. Is there any way to get Windows 7 to automatically switch the output to the headphones when they're plugged in? That's the behavior that happens without the monitor attached (i.e. it will switch from the laptop speakers to headphones when headphones are plugged in). I have the same issue with a Sony Vaio laptop running Windows 7 64-bit and an identical monitor, for reference. 

I'd like to copy the current link to the system's clipboard or write it to a file. If it isn't possible, I guess I'd have to settle with opening it in an external browser (which I was avoiding in the first place, thus using Lynx), and then copying the opened URL. :-/ 

I have Microsoft Office 2010 Starter on my Windows 7 laptop when I bought it. At some point, I installed a trial version of Microsoft Publisher 2010. Now, neither Word Starter nor Excel Starter would even startup. I've read in here (yeah, Yahoo! Answers, I know..) that, since the trial period expired, it also affected my Starter installation. Is there any hope of salvaging my Office Starter? I don't want to buy MS Office, even if it's just the Student edition. I would also prefer not to install OpenOffice (yet another office suite?!), since I already have Lotus Symphony installed (it's what we use at work, but I'm not satisfied at how it handles files created from MS Office, because the formatting changes, more often than not).
