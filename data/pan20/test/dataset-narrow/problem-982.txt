Then it looks at this folder (the default would be ) and checks if there is an executable . If it is, the converter works. The latest (as of 29. March 2016) installs avconv 11.2 I downloaded the newest release (11.3) from libav.org, and everything still works. Can be found here: 

There are multiple things that can happen here: Hidden Node Problem: $URL$ IEEE 802.11n 40 MHz channel switching to 20 MHz: Newer WiFi APs support 40 MHz channels and use them. Which is no problem as long as no data flows. When data flows and other nodes also use the same channels the AP might decide to switch back to 20 MHz. But then it might look like the adjacent channels are not used and it switches back to 40 MHz. This can happen so often, that your throughput collapses. The combination with hidden node problem makes this scenario worse. Try if you can limit your AP to only use 20 MHz channels. Amazon Fire Stick and many small devices (like smartphones and tablets) have really small antenna and are therefore a good deal worse at sending and receiving wifi signals. Also the orientation of the devices can influence signal quality. An isolation of the antennas is also much easier achieved by body parts (hands holding the device) or other cables (which are connected to the same TV as the Fire Stick). Also, wifi channels do overlap. The overlap is bigger for 802.11b than for 802.11g/n. Have a look at $URL$ So, if you use channel 6 and some of your neighbors use channels 3,4,5,7,8, or 9 you will have interference. So try to find a channel where you do not have this kind of partial overlap. 

When you have a network you lose two IP addresses one for broadcast and one for the network. The first IP is reserved to refer to the network while the last ip of the range is reserved for the broadcast address. 

Yep, its just like chrisF said, Here is a KB article from microsoft explaining it as well and Here is a KB article explaining what a DLL is. Think of them as library files for programs on your computer. They hold instructions on how to do different things for different programs. When you register it you are telling your computer that you have these instructions, where there at and programs that say they need them can use them now. 

Well if you are just looking for a cheap way to add an extra monitor and you can not or do not want to purchase a new video card you can always look at some of these USB video cards. The drivers for most that I have seen are only for windows systems and the cards will not be as powerful, but if you are looking for a cheap easy way to add an extra monitor, it is another option besides adding another internal video card. 

First, I would try to get access to chkdsk.exe if possible and run that on the drive just incase there is a problem with the filesystem and linux is just being much more picky about it. It seems that fat32 has a backup boot sector at sector 6. You could always try to replace sector 0 with that sector and see if it helps you out, but I would probably try the chkdsk route and see if that helps you out at all. 

Keep an eye on the same values as mentioned above. Now you should also be able to read the SMART values properly. SMART usually also has a log about previous errors that happened. Drive 1 hat at least two of them. The timestamp is usually expressed as power-on-hours. So you will have to calculate back from the current power-on-hours and see if this correlates with the time you experienced the problems. 

What will happen is: as soon as you advance your presentation to S2 the animation will start instantly and so will the transition timer. The moment the animation is done, the slide transition kicks in, and voilÃ : the next slide without a click. 

A GUI solution would be to use the of Windows. You can start it by pressing and entering this command: Then you can click on the tab to view all network connections, listening ports, etc. Here is a screenshot how it looks like: 

Mount your drives in a different pc/usb-enclosure/different SATA-port. Boot from a Live CD (e.g. Ubuntu or Knoppix). Perform a read only test of your drives. You can do this by SMART commands and/or by using tools like or 

Question: what should happen with non-HTTP traffic in the wireless network? Apart from that, you will have to do certain things: 

Yes, VPN is a good solution for your problem. The drawback is that VPN has a lot of pitfalls when it comes to security; VPN can exist (and be useful in some cases) without any encryption of the transferred data. How many people will use the VPN simultaneously? There are many solutions for small and medium companies which are quite easy to use. But they are (often) limited to a small amount of concurrent users (like 12, 24, or 32 users). Better/Unlimited solutions can be more difficult to set up. Also, if you have many concurrent users you have to think about performance and bandwidth requirements of your WAN connection etc. Server side: software solution There are many software VPN solutions available. You can set them up on a Linux machine or use a VM or a dedicated server. OpenVPN is a well known open source software. There are virtually dozens of tutorials (also YouTube videos) on how to set it up. There are clients for many platforms (i used it in Linux, Windows and Android). Maybe you want to use this for starters. pfSense is full featured firewall. Maybe overkill, but more feature rich than OpenVPN. There are also many tutorials out there. There are many many more ... Server side: hardware solution You could also go ahead an buy a Router with VPN. Most of the known manufacturers offer one and they all provide the client software. Maybe your router already supports VPN? This is usually easier to set up but also has its limits. The limitations vary between products and manufacturer. Configuration Do you use IPv4 or IPv6 or both? If you use IPv6 you need to pay special attention to your firewall configuration or else traffic might circumvent your encrypted VPN tunnel. Independent of which solution you choose you will have to think about the configuration, which in this case means mostly about IP routing. There are three basic types of VPN: end-to-end 

You need something to create a macro for your keyboard, basically creating a new "hotkey". Many keyboards that include multimedia keys have a program that will let you create new macros and remap the keyboard. Check in your keyboard application or go to control panel -> keyboard and you might find some options buried in there. If you do not then you will need to find a third-party utility that will create a macro for any key stroke and turn it into a new one. I have not had the need to use a third-party utility as the keyboards I purchase always have a built-in option to do this. The following link provides several utilities. If you try one of these and have issues someone here might be able to help you with the configuration. $URL$ 

with ? being the letter for the USB device. This will write a bunch of zeros to the entire flash drive, erasing everything on it. from there you should be able to fdisk or gparted into it and create a new partition. Another question for you. Was the device first formatted with at FAT filesystem? If so it might have been marked as dirty and you would have needed to run fsck.vfat on the unmounted device or chkdsk.exe (from windows). Let me know if you still can not get it working. 

I have had a few weird problems with desktop HP printers that are similar. The only way I have gotten windows to detect the printers again in my situations was to uninstall the printer driver, reboot and install the driver from scratch and then the printer works. One in particular is more flaky than its counterparts, it is an older model and I am just assuming there is some sort of damage with the unit itself since it supposedly worked better years before, but has stayed on the same XP system. 

I have a DSL router (Vigor2860Vn-plus) which has two WAN interfaces (DSL + Ethernet via another DSL Router) and a LAN interface. I am using SNMP to keep track of the traffic on these interfaces. Sometimes the router is overloaded and it seems like it is just sending traffic to the internet which is not originating from within my LAN. Any idea what could cause that? Could this be some kind of amplification attack? Is it maybe a fault in the router? Here are some graphs of the last incident. DSL upload is fully utilized. 

You can use 64bit OS, but this has nothing to do with having 2 CPUs. The CPU you have supports 64bit. 

A good reason would be to use multiple monitors. Most of today's graphic cards have 2-3 physical monitor connectors (althou some could provide the image for more). But also many mainboards have grapic cards (or use the cpu for that) and have their own minitor connectors. So, it depends on how many monitors you want to connect. Another reason would be to use the GPU for computations. This basically boils down to the question: does your software support using multiple GPUs for computation and can your computation-problem (a game can be seen as a computation problem) benefit from such a setup. If, for example, you want to do bitcoin-mining, the more hardware the better - but if you just want to play some 3D game, it will probably not support this and therefore not benefit from it. 

If you want to use it for TeamViewer you could use Ninite. Here you can select what applications you want to install, and it will download them and install them without further questions asked. It also has a silent mode if you want total silence. If you are looking for something more general I would suggest you use a combination of and batch scripts. But the file you want to install must have a silent mode. You will probably also run into the problem of the windows UAC kicking in at some point. You could make this more straight forward by forcing it to appear right at the beginning. by using this script: 

Is the problem that you are not getting an IP over wireless? If you set a static IP on your device within that network you can still contact the router? Also do you mean all interfaces besides the WAN port are bridged together? It sounds like DHCPD is not broadcasting over the bridge you setup (probably br0). From the webpage you could go to setup, networking, multiple dhcpd servers, click add and create one and choose its interface to be br0. Also you might want to go to setup, vlans and scroll to the bottom of that page and make sure the wireless box is set to LAN. I think from the web-gui this puts the radio on the LAN bridge. 

You don't mention what OS you are running, so I am going to assume it is Windows. Assuming that all of your computers are on the same network and can talk to each other, the easiest method of accomplishing the sharing of files would be to join all of the computers onto the same workgroup and setup Windows File Sharing. Here is the link to a video that appears to walk you through the process, that might be a little more helpful than some of the steps I will detail below. $URL$ Navigate to a folder that you would like to share on one computer, right click on it and click properties. Go to the sharing tab and click share; a new window should appear. Type Everyone when asked who you want to share this with, keep in mind that setting permissions this way will allow anyone else on your wireless network to access these files. You should then notice a link that says "Network Path" above the share button. IF you copy and paste this path into Windows Explorer on any other computer on the wireless network and access the shared files. The format of the network path is \\YourPCname\shared\folder\path.From windows explorer you can also click on the "Network" option on the far left panel, this will show you the names of the computers on your network, double click on any of these to see what folders they are sharing. This should be enough to get you going and allow you to ask more specific questions to further address your needs. Let us know if you have issues with any of the above, are using a different OS, or if you were looking for something else (In which case, please provide further information) 

I am curious: how big is the overhead introduces compared to ? Obviously there are different parts here: 

Since the stick works fine on the TV (which often use linux-based operating systems) and does not work in Windows, I would guess it is a partitioning issue. Use some partitioning tool (e.g., gparted or Partition Master) and check the partitioning. Things to look for: 

Initial connection time overhead due to additional round trips for encryption Is there a bandwidth overhead? 

You can also use a workaround: Let a cron-job check every few minutes if XMBC is still running and start it again if it is not. The corresponding bash could look like this: 

So, basically I am outputting the result of the first operation to and pipe it into another pdftk process and so on untill I am done. Is there a better way of doing this with only one pdftk process? Operations used are: and range selections on the pages. 

This paper gives a good overview about the topic: Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives 

And right now, you somehow logically ensure that P can not access L or I but only other Ps? And because P has physical access to AP you want to prevent what happens P presses the reset button. The problem is, someone with physical access to the AP could just pull out the cable and connect directly to your network and attack it. So doing some clever configuration on the AP does not help. What you want is a setup where the router manages who can access what on your network. (assuming P can not physically access R) There are several possibilities to achieve security here. One would be using VLANs. So setting each port of R where an AP is connected to belong to some specific VLAN (Access port). It would not work if the AP would do the VLAN tagging, because then the attacker could try to tag his own packets to belong to another VLAN. This would be called trunk port. You could use this tutorial as a primer on VLANs: $URL$
