The command is create a temp file with the new compression. However, it is trying to create a temp file but it cannot write to the directory tmpdir is mapped to. 

Step 2. Step 3. At this point, you can just type 'mysql' and you are in. However, you cannot run GRANT commands with grant tables disabled. Step 4. You will have to enter one superuser manually. Like this a) b) This will show all the columns in the user table. You will have to manually change each column like this: UPDATE mysql.user SET select_priv='Y',insert_priv='Y',... WHERE user='root' AND host='localhost'; c) Setup a password for root@localhost like this: 

Make sure not to monitor false positives should both replication threads are not running. SCENARIO #3 Give this scenario 

What the query does is generate every minute of a day. You inject the date in subquery AA SAMPLE DATA 

The following is just insane ranting and raving... If you leave all data in one table (no partitioning), you will have O(log n) search times using a key. Let's take the worst index in the world, the binary tree. Each tree node has exactly one key. A perfectly balanced binary tree with 268,435,455 (2^28 - 1) tree nodes would be a height of 28. If you split up this binary tree into 16 separate trees, you get 16 binary trees each with 16,777,215 (2^24 - 1) tree nodes for a height of 24. The search path is reduced by 4 nodes, a 14.2857 % height reduction. If the search time is in microseconds, a 14.2857 % reduction in search time is nil-to-negligible. Now in the real world, a BTREE index would have treenodes with multiple keys. Each BTREE search would perform binary searching within the page with a possible decent into another page. For example, if each BTREE page contained 1024 keys, a tree height of 3 or 4 would be the norm, a short tree height indeed. Notice that a partitiioning of a table does not reduce the height of the BTREE which is already small. Given a partitioning of 260 milliion rows, there is even the strong likelihood of having multiple BTREEs with the same height. Searching for a key may pass through all root BTREE pages every time. Only one will fulfill the path of the needed search range. Now expand on this. All the partitions exist on the same machine. If you do not have separate disks for each partition, you will have disk I/O and spindle rotations as an automatic bottleneck outside of partition search performance. In this case, paritioning by database does not buy you anything either if id is the only search key being utitlized. Partitioning of data should serve to group data that are logically and cohesively in the same class. Performance of searching each partition need not be the main consideration as long as the data is correctly grouped. Once you have achieved the logical partitioning, then concentrate on search time. If you are just separating data by id only, it is possible that many rows of data may never be accessed for reads or writes. Now, that should be a major consideration: Locate all ids most frequently accessed and partition by that. All less frequently accessed ids should reside in one big archive table that is still accessible by index lookup for that 'once in a blue moon' query. The overall impact should be to have at least two partitions: One for frequently accessed ids, and the other paritiion for the rest of the ids. If the frequently accessed ids is fairly large, you could optionally partition that. 

WARNING !!! Before you do anything, mysqldump the entire database or tarball /var/lib/mysql If you are concerned about case sensitivity, you need to hunt down the usernames in a special way I tried this little experiment 

DISCLAIMER : I haven't tried this myself What you asking for is somewhat rare. Nevertheless, it is possible. Here is a link to Looker.com to explain how. Basically, you do the following: 

The overall problem is that the PRIMARY KEY is not an INT. You cannot set up any real RANGE partitioning for a non-scalar type (such as CHAR string). Given this scenario, MySQL cannot avoid doing a SELECT lookup without opening every partition. OBSERVATION #2 A partitioned MyISAM table with 30 partitions is made up of 

It would include mysqldump for one simple reason: It uses a DB Connection. That DB Connection, when you do , has a running on a table at any given moment during the mysqldump. 

While I would normally not recommend this To download and install MySQL 5.1.34, run these commands at your Linux prompt AS IS... 

You were right when you said As recent as Jun 14 of this year, this issue may or may not exist in MySQL 5.7.11 

Here is a Stored Function called to Retrieve a List of ParentIDs starting from the First Generation all the up the hierarchy given an ID to start with: 

If all the tables are MyISAM or if all the tables are InnoDB and they do not have any foreign keys references, I got just the thing for you: NOT EVERY TABLE HAS universityID = 7 

The main thing here is to make sure is explicitly set in my.cnf on both Master and Slave. You must also make sure the server_id values are different from all other servers involved in the replication topology. If you are new to this, have a sysadmin join you to do this. 

Some compression is happening to data that is being inserted. If your file is growing, it must be doing some compression related work on every in terms of encoding/encryption. Note the Technical Details says under the subheading : 

If is 0, then is a Foreign Key Not Used By Any Primary Key To be 100% homogenous, should never show up as zero() (In a Perfect World). 

Your Question : When I try to dump an online database using , others cannot update the table. Are there any methods to solve this? You need to understand why other cannot update. Using MyISAM, each table experiences a full table lock with every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Using --lock-tables will attempt to lock every table, but will be held up of SELECTs are being issued in a heavy-read environment. There are other alternatives. Your Question : As I am using MyISAM, does for InnoDB help? InnoDB is an ACID-compliant storage engine and can have data updated and read in transactions. Row-level locking is normally issued in InnoDB, which allows for other to read and write to tables while they being backed up. MyISAM does not allow this given its full-table locking protocol. Therefore, MyISAM is not assisted by at all. If every table you created was InnoDB, then you could perform an online backup on a running master. Your Question : Also, is Master-Slave architecture the ultimate method to handle backing up online DB? Master/Slave does make it easier to backup an online database because you perform the backup using mysqldump on the slave while the Master continues to accept INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs. In addition, this allows for backups that allow for point-in-time recovery. You would simply perform the following steps on a slave: 

My guess is the query in your question looks like PostgreSQL information_schema. The current database is assumed when you connect to it. I believe you want the MySQL equilavent Here is my suggestion for the Top 10 tables in the Current Database. 

There is no SQL mechanism for select every other row. You will have to use an user-defined auto increment variable as follows: ODD 

Keep in mind that while InnoDB support for an auto_increment column in a exists, it does not have the same auto_increment behavior as MyISAM. MyISAM can bind with other columns to allow a number to exist multiple times, InnoDB does not do that. Once an auto_increment value is used, it is unique for the whole table. The excerpt you found 

WAMP/LAMP environments was set up with this mind. MySQL would come with the bare essentials for installing MySQL and storing and backing up data. Such bare essential utilities may include: 

If that is what happened, test that again against a 10 GB file. While it is replicating, goto into the OS in /var/lib/mysql and do and look for the relay logs. You should see 10 consecutive relay logs 1GB. That will show it for sure because under normal circumstances, every relay log context switch skips by 3 files not 1. Seeing multiple 1GB relay logs reveal that the data for the recently executed on the Master is currently being shipped over. I hope this solves the mystery you have been experiencing.
