Type-C original specifications (and Power Delivery specifications over Type-C connector, if any) are designed precisely for the sake of compatibility and inter-operability. Since both Type-C devices come from reputable manufacturers, I would expect that they are compliant to all related specifications, and no harm will be done to any of your devices. The message from Chromebook means that the Nexus charger has either basic charging capabilities, or less capabilities than is expected by Chromebook. This means that the Chromebook charger has more capabilities than the basic "safe" power delivery. However, the Nexus phone, assuming it is designed correctly, should negotiate only what it needs, and the Chromebook charger should provide what Nexus is asking for, and nothing more. So it should be perfectly safe to use Chromebook charger for Nexus phone. This is the entire idea behind intelligence that is built into Type-C power delivery. 

The problem is that the Win7 ISO installation package doesn't have drivers for EHCI/xHCI USB controllers. As soon as the intermediate Windows image takes control over PC, the BIOS/UEFI drivers are eliminated, the USB drops off, and you can't proceed with anything USB. To fix the issue you need to re-create the ISO boot image, for example, as suggested in this article by Thomas Maurer. This INTEL article might be of help as well. 

First, try to plug your monitor into each of four output ports of the Radeon card. It is possible that only certain output gets configured on power-on default. If no luck, get another older PC with regular PCI slot (and a PCIe slot for the questionable Radeon card). And get a very basic (but known good) PCI video card. Or, if you have a PC with two x16 PCIe slots, get a working PCIe video card. Start first with good video card, and get all necessary drivers. Direct BIOS to configure the card as primary video, if possible. Then turn power off, and plug the questionable card, and work from there. If the Radeon is half functional, you should see something in device manager. 

Now to your questions: A. There could be Type-C video cards, but I have no info if anyone makes them. B. There could be Type-C DP-only graphics cards, but see (A). Not sure what do you mean under "shared". C. No, there is no "graphics card" in a monitor itself in any case. In case of a dedicated graphics card with Type-C connector (used as a dedicated DP port), the graphics controller resides on host system, as a usual PCIe card. In case of "video over USB" and DisplayLink, the graphics is done in software by means of Virtual Graphics Card Technology. For some discussion about DisplayPort and USB over Type-C, see this superuser thread. 

When working with block selections, you can resize the area by dragging the handles on each of the four corners. However, I can't seem to find a way to resize the area by dragging a single side of the rectangle. If Acrobat lacks this feature, I will be surprised. Example: MS Paint vs Adobe Acrobat. Workaround: I am currently using Mouse Keys () to move one axis at a time when dragging a corner. It works, but it is less than ideal. 

Alternatively, Word will draw table gridlines if you have enabled under File > Options > Advanced > Show document content. The option above only applies to tables while this applies to the entire document. Also, the lines are dotted instead of dashed. 

This is a Community Wiki based on a question that was deleted right before I was able to post a solution. The user's AutoHotkey script had a few mistakes in it, so I wrote one that fixes them. The problem they were facing was that a new Console2 process was started every time, instead of activating a process that was set to the background. My solution is below... 

It appears that Safari is reading your code as intended, while Firefox/Chrome is reading it as written; i.e. with and without the attribute. 

But... If you wanted to style the property on tab labels, menu item labels, and download labels, the following CSS selectors will work: 

Hotstrings only affect what you physically type. To perform search and replace on the Clipboard you can use the RegExReplace command. Below is a script which copies the selected text and then pastes the modified contents (after search and replace). I believe this is what you meant: 

Assuming that you are currently in the directory where is located, or is in a %Path% directory. Example: 

This is not a problem with Windows 7. The autoscroll feature is part of the touchpad's software/drivers. Look in your system tray for or similar application. From there, you may find the setting to turn off autoscroll. 

Alternatively... Setting Firefox to will hide the link or button to manage cookies. To enable the button, you must choose or as @kreemoweet mentioned. 

Technically, NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) can be utilized to provide comments or metadata for any file. Windows XP took advantage of this with the dialog for files. Microsoft removed this feature in Windows Vista, however, the ability to create ADS is still possible with the command line or other utilities. I think the easiest solution would be to find a Windows Explorer replacement which supports comments or metadata for any file. Xplorer^2 is one such file manager. (I tried to find a free or opensource file manager with metadata support, but this feature does not seem to be too popular...) Anyway, for what it's worth, Xplorer^2 uses ADS for file comments. 

After reading the question few times and looking into the linked thread, the answer is: No, you can't achieve the same functionality as laptop on your "desktop PC", even if it has Type-C (or other USB3) port. The reason is as follows: Your laptop Type-C port shows functionality of both video and USB3.0 hub when connected to Type-C port on the display. It means that the laptop supports full-featured extended Type-C function, aka "DisplayPort Dock": it has full USB3 (using two differential SS lanes), and two-lane Display Port connection, all over the single Type-C connector. For information, full-featured C-C cable can use four super-speed differential pairs for this purpose. Your desktop PC doesn't have this "combined" USB+DP feature, it has only vanilla USB 3 ports, both of Type-A and Type-C. None of this ports supports DP function, that's why the display won't work with Type-A to Type-C cable, nor with CC cable. In both cases however you should have the hub functionality, but not video. The fact of USB-C port being loose has nothing to do with display/USB function nor with USB 3.0 or 3.1. Older (and in general) Type-C receptacles are flaky, loose, and there was some ECN for improvements in spring retention functionality of the shroud, if I recall correctly. Nowadays there is another addition to Type-C connector, connectors with retention screw(s) to solve this general mechanical problem. In short, the function of simultaneous switch of display and hub using one Type-C cable is impossible with your current desktop PC. 

When counting hubs, you assume that every individual box/device has only one hub. This assumption is likely untrue. To begin, the 10-port "amazon hub" definitely has at least two hubs in chain, because single hubs are not manufactured with 10 ports, 7-port maximum [see this explanation]. Then the Dell monitor has also some special design - it has TWO UPSTREAM ports. What is its internal architecture, who knows. The "surface dock" is also a suspect for having more than one USB hub in the chain. And I don't know if the "surface" uses extra internal hub for whatever reason. To get the actual idea how many hubs are there in the chain and what/how all things are connected, use USBTreeView.exe on the Surface side. I am sure the Surface got the chain right, and you do have more than 5 hubs in the chain. Addition: USB standard allows for 127 devices per one root controller, it doesn't mean that they are "daisy chained", just total of 127. In fact, if we discount hubs as functional USB devices, the total number of useful devices comes down to 102, since you would need 17 7-port hubs to accommodate the devices, in three-tier configuration, and each hub will take one address out of available space. 

If pressing Down, End moves the cursor to the end of the next line, you can define a hotkey using AutoHotkey to simplify the process. For example, if I wanted Alt+Down to do the above, I could write this script: 

You do not need to create GUIs or use hotkeys with AutoHotkey. You can write powerful command line utilities by compiling an script. That being said, you will want to look at the FileAppend command for working with . 

If you have a dark wallpaper and there are no windows behind the Firefox window, you can use AutoHotkey to make the window transparent when it loses focus, and opaque when it gains focus. I've come up with a simple script that should also be light on resources: 

To show tabs below the address bar, Right-click the empty space to the right of the New Tab button and enable . 

So, we can use the following file formats: SVG, PNG, or JPEG. With drawings, you'd want to work with vector rather than raster graphics, so you're left with SVG. 

The fonts should now be usable in other applications while the PortableApps.com platform is running. 

Note: Before the design of the slideshow was brought up, my answer would have worked. Now, I think that @TheElectricMuffin's answer is the best for @Matthieu. I'm leaving my answer up for those who may be looking for a way to disable only the keyboard shortcuts. 

This is not a direct solution to your problem, but you can install and use Firefox Portable without administrator privileges. From my experience, there is no difference in performance when installed on the same media as a normal Firefox installation. 

If I understand correctly, you want to set all and related elements to be visible by altering the attribute if necessary. You can do this with JavaScript and jQuery. 

After searching using Search Engine A, click the icon in the address bar. The search suggestions drop-down will appear. 

Yes. If the computer can handle it, you can run multiple virtual machines simultaneously. The easiest configuration would be to have them all use bridged network adapters, so they are on the same subnet as the host. 

I am writing a personal application using AutoHotkey to speed up common tasks. One thing I do often is change my desktop background to solid white (for screenshots I post on Super User, as you may have noticed). My current approach is the following: 

is the correct option. A workaround would be to edit the image so that it matches your display setup, i.e. instead of , the resulting image could be rearranged as .
