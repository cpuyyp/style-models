It will turn my screen off, then back on. So I'm thinking that maybe my script isn't getting called. 

It is not possible to downgrade from a fresh Windows 10 install as you only have a license for Windows 10 and not Windows 8.1. The only time it is possible to downgrade is if you upgraded from a previous Windows installation. 

I just wanted to update this: Google has now added about 30 new themes to their page, under the artist tab. Some are really good, some aren't but at least we have more choices. 

I really hate the Google Chrome Dev warning that opens every time I use Google Chrome on Linux. Is there anyway to disable it. 

Check that the CPU fan is spinning on startup Check if there is any/enough thermal paste between heat sink and CPU Remove the RAM Sticks and try booting with single sticks to see if it's a faulty stick Swap the PSU out for another... If all else fails, swapping the graphics card for another would be worth a try 

This can be due to a number of things, narrow the possibilities down by removing (where possible) the component and checking it for obvious faults. This is how i would do it: 

How it came about: On a Windows 7 Pro 32-Bit Machine. I was running an incremental backup covering the usual user specific data and a couple of manually selected directories (nothing special: no system directories) with the standard windows backup and restore function. At roughly 50% of the operation my system froze up not reacting in any way holding that state for about 5 minutes followed by a self-induced reset. Since this reset: The SSD [PNY XR8 120GB / 4 weeks old] is no longer being recognized by the BIOS. What i have tried: 

BABUN: You should take a look at Babun! I'm a Linux guy and this is the first program I install on my Windows machines. It's a very nice redux of cygwin and installing it is as simple as any other .msi installer. By default the shell is zsh, which I love, but you can easily change that to bash and bash comes preinstalled with Babun as well. 

Is there a way to hook up a standard DVD player to a DirecTV HD DVR and record the content to this disk? If not is there a way to record the content onto a computer to later be recorded onto a DVD. 

Chrome and Firefox are relatively easy about this, a matter of copying folders...IE handles things slightly different it seems, more Info behind the links: • Chrome • Firefox • Internet Explorer 

The Problem lies in the fact that the WOL Function relies on an Ethernet Broadcast which solely goes by a MAC-Address (OSI Layer 2), not an IP (Layer 3). Trying to do this through a VPN-Connection will usually go wrong, with the following settings you can get around this: Setup Port-Forwarding in your Router with UDP Port 9 (WOL Layer 3 Pakets usually go by this port) on your local machine - don't forget to set static IP's since DHCP will jumble things up (eventually) also be careful, if you do have a dhcp range you want to keep alive, set static IP's outside this range. 

I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 and when listening to music I usually just turn the volume up and down with the buttons on my PC. Tonight however, I found out that my headphones I've had for 3 years broke (only the right speaker was working because of a short), so I open volume control and adjusted it so that it would send all sound to the right speaker. Now whenever I play music without my headphones and try to change the volume with the buttons on my computer it does absolutely nothing. Is there a way I can reset the default values for the volume control? 

TP-LINK TL-R470T+ is an inexpensive option with 3 additionally configurable ports (wan/lan) although i don't have any experience in the setup of this kind of thing TP-LINK has always been a stable and quiet cheap solution. Edit: Since your main concern is stability, i would refrain from trying to build little DIY-Solutions. The configuration is generally much broader/deeper than using a router with this kind of functionality. In addition to that, you don't really want to be troubleshooting 10 components when the system breaks... 

After doing a Ctrl + Alt + Del - you will find the Power Options in the bottom right corner (under Windows 7). From there you can hybernate 

Everytime I start Ubuntu I get a warning message that says my hard disk is failing. Big deal, it's just a warning, I'm a programmer, I ignore warnings (kidding). On a more serious note: I've already backed up all my data that I need, but I gonna continue to use this computer until it explodes dag napbit! So how do I tell Ubuntu that I don't care and make it stop showing me the warning? 

Such a tool does exist, it's called Timeshift. The linked article is about Ubuntu but it works for multiple distros. 

I have the airline plugin installed for vim and no matter which theme I pick there is always an orange arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen. How can I fix this? 

In that case go to the Snapshot manager and create a clone of your defined snapshot. The VM has to be turned off - the clone will then be your base vhd including your snapshot file (which only documents changes to base vhd). 

You cannot remove the button - but you can keep Windows from prompting you if applications are still open when the WaitToKillAppTimeOut is reached.Do this by opening regedit - go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/Desktop/ and if not already present create a new entry called AutoEndTasks of Type REG_SZ with the value set to 1. 

Standard: C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\ Fallback: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application 

If nothing in the boot process changes: Motherboard...?! At this point the question you have to ask yourself is wether or not it actually makes sense to spend hours (eventually days) tracking down the problem, or wether it's better to build/buy a new system...obviously depends on wether this is purely private and fun/hobby or if you really need to get some work done and don't need this. Replacing a not so new Aspire L320 shouldn't cost a lot (especially in comparison to the hours spent trying to fix it). By the way: Continue posting your results as you try solving this, someone might have had the exact component/problem and can add to the issue. 

I been trying to convert my HTML file to MediaWiki format by exporting it using OpenOffice. I keep getting this error message though: 

I'm trying to install my wireless drivers (which uses a broadcom card). I tried to install them using the restricted drivers offered on my Ubuntu CD (since my only internet connection is public Wi-Fi). However when I clicked activate it got about halfway through the install process before it gave me this error message: 

I would like for Notepad++ to add the closing tag when I finish typing the open tag. I know there is a plugin to do this for XML but it doesn't work on my HTML files and I have yet to find one that does. 

That's a BIOS Code for Bad Memory. Remove single sticks to narrow it down or swap them all out if nothing works. 

Your Motherboard is not being powered properly. Check your connection PSU <-> Motherboard. Check again, and again and again... 

This can happen due to a number of reasons, so go by trial and error for the following cases: • Is the File to be executed empty? Check the Filesize... • Are you trying to run a 64-Bit app on a 32-Bit Version of your OS? and lastly... • Is JDK 7 installed and is your path set? Run Ctrl + R and type cmd hit Enter and type path and Enter again. If your Java Bin Directory is not in this string then that is your Problem. 

I know this probably isn't what you want to hear, but from what I can tell there is no fix for this, just a lot of upset Thinkpad & VMWare users: VMWare Communities VMWare Communities 2 I think the problem is that the VM Ware window is capturing the mouse event, and not doing anything with it. A possible solution might be if there is a driver for the trackpoint that you could download and install, you might be able to get it working in the guest OS. 

One way you could do this would be to create a folder full of shortcuts to these locations. Then pin the shortcut to the taskbar. Remember to change the shortcut icon before you pin it to the taskbar.
