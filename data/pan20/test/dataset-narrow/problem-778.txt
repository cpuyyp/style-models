Here's our scenario. Windows 2k8 print server hosting a large Ricoh multi-function color laser printer for everyone in the office to use. Printers are NOT deployed with Group Policy. Management wants the printer to default on printing black and white, but still allow people to print in color if they need to. Setting the default in the driver will work for a freshly added printer, but as soon as someone changes the setting to print in color on their client, it stays that way until they manually change it back. Ideally, we would like it to forget whatever settings the user applied when they close whatever application they're printing from, but at the very least, I'd like it to reset these settings on login. Is there a 'right' or 'easy' way to accomplish this? The only thing I can think of that I know will work, is pushing a login script that deletes and re-adds the printer... but this seems... hacky. My google-fu on this topic is evidently not very strong. I appreciate whatever help you can give me, thanks! 

That way you’re getting all the redundancy benefits of raid10, but also gives the benefits of snapshotting the VM for example before a major change giving you rollback opportunities too! Although LVM IS optional 

Check the terms of service. In fairness you have no legal obligation as far as I’m aware to justify your licensing to them.. however we are not lawyers and for accurate advice you should really contact some legal professionals. I don’t believe they have any right to dictate you install software however this may well be in the terms of service. With regards to the admin access.. don’t they have that already if it’s managed hosting? You should contact the company’s help desk to ensure they actually sent that email BEFORE making any action. A simple who is against your ip will probably reveal who owns the IP and subsequently your hosting provider is and then start a social engineering attempt against you 

BACKGROUND Each FTP server implementation decides if/how to invoke access controls, per File Transfer Protocol (FTP) technical specification RFC 959: 

Our IT environment provides 10 shared, Microsoft Windows 7 laptops for an office staff of several hundred people. After checking-out and logging into a laptop with an Active Directory domain account, office staff frequently run Microsoft Outlook 2010. However, the first time office staff do this, Microsoft Outlook 2010 prompts the user to create and configure their local account. This takes just several clicks, as Microsoft Outlook 2010 auto-detects the office staff member's Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 (SP3) account. The problem is: all office staff have to do this on each new laptop they use. Until they do so, some functionality does not work (for example, Microsoft Word 2010 Save & Send fails with error "There was a problem creating the message"). How might our IT department "pre-configure" the shared laptops so office staff can simply log-in and use Microsoft Outlook 2010 functionality without the need to configure a local account? 

Try installing the WordPress plugin ‘wordfence’ I use it a lot as it not only tracks live traffic you can block IPs it will also send you emails about missing security updates for plugins (including itself) and the entire WordPress installation. It can also scan the WP files and let you know for dodgy content. You can also manually run head and tail commands on Linux against WordPress files or grep them all, you want to look out for any base64 in the files. That part was more for the clean up, although wordfence will also identify things like this too 

/tmp is shared by default. You can probably make it work out of there, but probably better to use a more traditional document root. If you want the files to be cleared out with any regularity you could just clear the directory with a scheduled script. 

If it were me, and I was in that much of a hurry, I'd go get a couple more flash drives and copy them. If you don't already have a few extras lying around they're cheap as dirt now-a-days... The other option would be to set up a PXE server and put the image in there, but that will likely take longer than simply installing them one at a time. Would help out in the future though if you have to do this kind of thing with any frequency. 

Configure NGINX to point to that page for genuine 404 errors. Once that’s done, when you want to redirect your app in places just redirect them to a bogus page A previous answer said it correctly, when you’re pulling your 404 page at it’s genuine place, it will return a 200, because you’ve requested a page that does exist. 

Check you can ping the FQDN. You’re using another dns server and not say google dns. If you can ping it, you can do it. If ping works, check firewall. If you’re running against the FQDN even tho you’re on the same server without a host entry then you’re no longer using the private profile in firewall and need to disable or add an exception for the public profile. 

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event. The following information was included with the event: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE [CLIENT: ] The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file It may be helpful to note that this seemed to start happening right after we migrated WSUS from another server onto this one. I've been searching all over the internet for someone who has this exact error and I'm not finding anything. (Don't you hate it when that happens?) I've tried completely removing the WDS role and reinstalling it -- didn't help. I suppose I'd really just like some guidance on where to go from here if anyone has any ideas. 

Surely you could just check the password used by the 900 applications in order to determine what it is? Have you checked if they’re stored in plain text? E.g web.config sql connection string? Also, could you not setup a new user and password and deploy it to the 900 applications? I know if I had 900 applications running with hard coded user details I would have a deployment system setup.. 

That does indicate your drive had a problem but it doesn’t necessarily indicate the drive is failing and needs replacing. That is actually saying that the drive has noticed a problem and will try to correct it. If it succeeds... happy days. If not then you’ll need to replace the drive. Offline uncorrectable value is the one you should be worried about. If that one is anything other than 0, then it’s time to replace the drive. Additionally, if you’re using mdraid check it’s not degrading the array as that might cause you boot problems tl;dr don’t worry. If it graduates to offline uncorrectable then worry. If you have raid then you can sit back and relax. 

Windows Command-line scriptable, so we can automate it...sorry, FileZilla (?) FTPS, as it seems to perform better than SFTP The ability to send KeepAlive commands to the FTPS control port during a transfer No passwords sent on the command line...sorry, curl 

Since password policy represents a form of access control, and RFC 959 specifies no password reset mechanism, it seems reasonable to conclude each FTP server implementation decides if/how to support FTP client-initiated password resets. In practice, this represents what we see: 

Start > Run... > perfmon Select menu View > Customize... Uncheck option "Standard menus (Action and View)" Select button "OK" 

If you don’t see a block of unallocated space then your drive is faulty. Before submitting an RMA ensure that your raid card firmware is completely up to date, have enough power (I.e your server PSU is powerful enough to support all your hardware) etc as they’ll make you jump through them hoops before they actually do anything anyway 

You need to install AD DS roles on the windows server and from there promote it to a domain controller. You can then tell workstations to join the domain and manage logins from AD as you have previously. DHCP isn’t tied to using the domain - or else you’d get no Addresses now! Two separate things, it’s just centralising them in one place. You can move some or all computers to the Domain as you see fit
