I am using the raspberry pi NOIR board to supply a Python motion detection script. This "motion detection script" uses opencv2 to grab, modify and detect motion. I wanted to extend the motion detection script, by adding a continuous live feed, within the motion detection script, but have run into problems. The problem I have, is I cannot have the two operations accessing the NOIR camera board together, because this upsets the PI. 1) Is it some how possible to have two scripts grabbing frames together using the below code in each? 

Firstly, I've googled around, but got myself horribly confused; hence this question. I have a headless/keyboardless Raspberry pi with a camera board on it, that I connect to via ssh using my windows PC. I'm trying to display a window, on my windows PC, with a picture taken using a python script and opencv2, but am having problems doing that. I am using putty and xming, and can see the raspberry pi's desktop. I run the script via the terminal on the PI's desktop. The below script saves, and rotates the jpg, but doesn't display the picture on my pc and gives an error: 

where I cannot see two processes trying to access the port 1991 on 192.168.1.61. Am I doing anything incorrectly? I'm still confused what could be happening with the "address already in use" error listed above. Another edit resulting from comments I start the socket using the command: which calls the CamHandler class to deal with constructing the stream. the CamHandler class looks like this: 

it works, so this would appear that my pi doesn't like popleft() 1) Is this the case, i'm not sure how to check if popleft is available in Python 3.2.3? 2) How do I fix this? 3) if poleft isn't available in the newer version of python, then is there an equivalent? there an 

I tried , but that made no difference, then i tried which did the job! Thanks Rune Vikestad for suggesting this, I can now install packages again. Does this suggest i had too much installed on my 4GB sd card or something else? 

I have a python script to send me an email when i detect motion from my noir Pi camera, which is been successfully called. I know the script is being called, as i get the email on movement; but the script doesn't copy the jpgs from to Have i got the syntax correct at the bottom of this script? 

According to the /boot/overlays/README, the would only needed if it is operated in 2-wire parasitic mode. My configuration is clearly not running in parasitic mode, but nevertheless, this seems to solved the problem, and I can get the temperature data consistently and correctly. Information abstracted from /boot/overlays/REAME 

I'm not sure this will work but I would try to add in the configuration on Pi zero which basically telling the Pi to add interfaces that you want brought up at boot time. If this is not working, maybe sharing your and on P3 would help to diagnostic. 

One of the problem about those online tutorials is that they are obsoleted and never bother to update it, and many tutorials were prior nodejs has the official binary package for ARM CPU which Raspberry Pi used. Please take a look at this link for the correct installation. Please noted that the link does not refer to the latest available binary, please visit the official download page of nodejs, and right click on ARMv7 for Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 (or ARMv6 for older Raspberry Pi) to copy the link and replace it with the commands that refer to the early version of nodejs. 

If you have the access of your router, you can set up static IP from your router instead of from RPi. All you need is the MAC address of the USB Ethernet port. 

This will create a web server serving HTTP on your local network at $URL$ (i.e. $URL$ You will need to install (and learn) Flask for python web development. The simplest flask python code that addressed your question of serving the sensor data to a web page would be: 

Both way you described (either using a potentiometer as a voltage divider, or connecting a resistor between the contrast control pin (Vo) and ground) are valid configuration. The contrast of the LCD is determined by the voltage (VLCD) between the Vcc and Vo. When terminating the Vo with a resistor to the ground, the internal impedance between Vcc and Vo formed a voltage divider with the external resistor. 

mariadb by defaults uses UNIX_SOCKET plugin to authenticate user root. $URL$ It works by retrieving uid of the process that has connected to the socket and allowing to connect to the MariaDB account with the corresponding user name. In another word, if you are running your RPi as user, when you run 

Iv'e done some more tests and this is what ive found out, so far: a) I logged in to my pi via xming and putty as user pi. I then created a shortcut to the script, and ran it, which worked and created an image on the desktop of my pi. 

I've been looking in the syslog file to try and find out why this may be happening but i'm getting myself confused, so I've switched my attention to a patch, not a fix. From what I understand of the logs, the wifi seems to stop trying to re connect and will only reestablish following a reboot. A nasty but effective way of re establishing the connection, is to but I'm running a headless PI so I have to pull the power. Could someone give me some pointers on how to modify this script to force a reboot if the script has been called 10 times in succession, but the wifi is still down. Script 

It then temporarily displayed a new "image" window. b) But when I changed the to the script saves a jpg but didn't display a new "image" window. c) With this in mind, I then tried in LXTerminal on the desktop, which didn't display the "image" window, but did produce the jpg and when I did it takes the image but i get the error again: 

3) The current network setup worked prefectly with this adapter but I think I need to find the correct driver to install for the current adapter. 4) I've found this, but it only lists drivers up to Linux version 3.12.26 and I'm on 3.12.28. Can someone please point me in the correct direction for the correct driver and how to install it? 

I am in the process of a , but it appears to have frozen at This is the output from the ssh screen since the update command: 

I pulled the power, connected it to a keyboard and tv, then did a 'shutdown -rF now' and 'rpi-update' and now have it connecting via ssh 

2) Is it possible to modify the server script to incorporate the CV2 motion detection stuff, and have it continually detecting motion, regardless of the state of the server? 3) If I have two scripts, and only have the motion detection script grabbing a img (numpy array), how could I pass this img to the server script for display over the web? I hope I've made myself clearer... 

It will make more sense to setup "IP and Mac binding" on your router in your case for whatever reason you'd want to run multiple OS. The procedure varies from router to router, but all you need is the MAC address of RPi eth0 or RPi wlan0 MAC address. run to find out the MAC address, for RPi built-in and when your RPi is connect to the network, the mac address has a prefix of . No, you can't map more than 1 IP for the same MAC. 

You didn't provide the full program so it is hard to know what you are missing, but I think you probably setting up the client mix up the client/server relationship. 

You should create a user for your current user, and grant all the privileges to the user, this will allows you to access the database server without sudo. Remember to restart the service at shell: 

First, WEP key (i.e. password) only allowed hexadecimal digits (i.e. 0 - 9, A - F) as password, therefore 'hello' is not a valid password, and maximum length for the password is 26 hexadecimal digits (or 104 bits). This is the reason that WEP is not very secure and seldom be used nowadays. If you still want to use WEP, here is what you need to do. Run your editor (example using nano) to modify the configuration of file: 

As per @Ghanima's suggestion, repost my updated as a separate answer. I've solved the problem by myself by changing the settings from 

You didn't mentioned what OS distro you are using. But if you are using Raspbian Stretch, RPi.GPIO is included in default installation of Python 2.7, but it does not seems to be included in Python 3.5 by default, you will probably have to install it either running: 

This happened quite often lately with Raspbian Stretch, somehow running screw up the gateway setting. This can be observed by run the following command: 

Data communication are often serialised and transmit in instead of string. Bytes in python are indicated by the prefix in front of the data as you shown but you are trying to treat it as a as your if statement is trying to compare, you can confirm that the return data are indeed in bytes by by running: 

I found the reason why it wasn't working, I needed to set the permissions on the PI_pictures folder to 0777! for other users! 

Or a more elegant solution is not to load the integers in in the first place, define an empty deque, and specify the max_qlen when one calls the function! 

I'm trying to understand how this Python script works, but am struggling with 1 to 3 below, so if someone could explain these I'd appreciate it. 1) 'ping -c 2 -w 1 -q 192.168.1.1 |grep "1 received" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null' Iv'e tried this at terminal, but it didn't work, how can I test it outside of this script? 2) 'logger "WLAN Down, Pi is forcing a reboot"' Where does this message get logged; Iv'e looked in syslog and messages, but cannot see the text inside the double quotes. 3) 'sudo /sbin/ifdown wlan0 && sleep 10 && sudo /sbin/ifup --force wlan0' 

Thanks Bex for your help :) I think it's working now by changing the uid and gid to motion in the fstab davfs mount command. I used this page for reference. I also noticed that the mounted directory had 0777 permissions with user pi, then I modified the fstab file then did a reboot; to test the re mount. Following the reboot the permissions changed to 0755 with user motion ; this may explain how the permissions could change, as you suspected. I'm happy, thanks again, Reggie :) P.S. I didn't change the rw to rwx after looking at the above link, i didn't think it was valid. 

Oh dear! I didn't read the comments, the first comment suggested i chainge the type of quotation marks, and bingo it worked, Sorry! This worked: 

a) The motion side of the script works, but the server doesn't. b) I can serve a simple webpage using the same IP address and port, using a different script, so I don't think something else is using that port. c) Both PI and laptop are on the same local network. 1) Are there any other tests I can do, that could point to what is wrong? 2) What do these errors suggest?
