Turns out there was an implicit rule in the firewall defined on the bridge which dropped fragmented packets. This is not shown in the normal firewall overview. I ended up turning off this 'feature' in the system ->advanced -> firewall/NAT section. 

I think you should first opt to run a dual stack, meaning to run IPv4 and IPv6 next to each other. In that way you can steadily progress to an all IPv6 environment once IPv4 is getting faced out. Some countries do not speak IPv4 anymore (like China) and others haven't opted in for IPv6 or only partially. 

CCNA requires the student to be familiar with the IOS operating system, this makes the Cisco 2948 unusable for a CCNA lab as it runs Catalyst OS (CatOS) and there is no way to upgrade the operating system from CatOS to IOS. So while it may have more features, for a pure CCNA lab it's not really usable. Personally I would also recommend the following equipment (if you are not opting for GNS3): 

Broadcast storms will play tricks on your network and you will never know why. When users complain all they will get is a shrug of the shoulders. 

I have the current rules in an attempt to open port 5060 and 10000-20000 for my VoIP provider. We are on a Cisco 1921 router. This ACL is applied to the WAN port on the router facing the ISP. Nmap port scan shows these ports as closed. 

I have the native VLAN on my trunk links set to VLAN 10 which is my management VLAN that spans the entire network. We have one WLC and Access Points connected on a trunk link set to native VLAN20 which is the wireless VLAN. I was wondering if I should have all network devices on the same Native VLAN to avoid any mismatch issues for cisco and other protocols that run untagged over the network? We have a lot of Apple and L2 devices on the network that would like to utilize protocols wired or wireless. I have configured mDNS on the WLC but still having issues with basic print jobs. I was planning on moving the WLC to the VLAN10 but I have read articles that recommend different ways of deploying the controller. 

I've always wondered what the use of wild card masks was. When I learned about them in college I wondered what the use was, we saw that you could separate subnets by for instance even and uneven IPs. What is the practical use of wild card masks vs normal subnet masks? 

I'm trying to find out what the command line option is to set the password memory of an F5 BIG IP. I know Password Memory can be set from the GUI but I'm not sure how it is done using the tmsh? I reviewed the online documentation of F5, but this command wasn't listed. 

While they may be on the same network, it is still easier to seperate them as you can restrict and control inbound traffic a lot better (because you seperate them in groups) based on the purpose. It might be that you do not want people connecting through the VPN to have access to all machines in the network. 

Switch is a layer 2 device. IP addresses or subnet masks are above masks are above the switch's pay grade:p So in between these hosts if you connected a switch, the broadcast messages will be sent to all interfaces unless you have configured additional VLANs. If we have a router is connected between these hosts, there is no broadcasts in IP as such and it is completely normal for router to have different interfaces in different subnets. If it has a route for these hosts, the communication can take place. 

Yes it can be done. you can exchange routes using BGP. Now these routes are present in your RIB. For the FIB, it chooses routes based on the administrative distance:- static routes , connected , other routing protocols , etc. if the route exchanged via BGP has the least AD, it will make its way in the forwarding table. However I doubt it as it is the same subnet, your device will have a route as 'connected' for the subnet. Connected has the least AD. You can still try to use BGP, and the see RI and FIB status. 

Should the gateways of each subnet/vlan reside on the main L3 switch? Do I need to trunk any VLAN's to the router? Is there any double NAT happening?...cable modem is in bridge mode Should I configure default gateways on my switches? Any other suggestions such as changing the addressing scheme?..router not being .1 bugs me 

Can anyone help verify my ACL and correct my rule if necessary? Do I need an outbound ACL to open up the port as well since this is for a hosted VoIP PBX? Is Nmap not detecting the open port because I am not the specific host for the ACL? I tried some other ports that are not specific to a public IP and Nmap also shows as closed. Do my L3 switches behind the router also need an ACL to open ports if they are between the PC and the router? 

I was wondering if there is a single command to clear a single network port's configuration? (wipe switchport, portsecurity,...) 

Technically one router and one switch should be sufficient, ideally you should have two switches and two routers (as redundancy). Also it should not be an issue to install several network cards into the router, however 1.200 isn't considered a lot of money for a decent professional router, so it might be that these routers do not support expanding the network sites. What you might consider doing is purchasing one or several layer 3 switches instead (switches which function at layer 2 and 3, so also allowing basic routing) 

I was wondering if it's possible at all to configure a password policy which enforces password complexity for locally defined accounts. I know it's possible for TACACS+ and RADIUS, but I need to know if it's possible to enforce such policy for locally defined accounts. The devices I have in scope are running IOS and NX-OS 

Some technician from the VoIP company was claiming that there is double NAT since he saw two private ip addresses in a trace route. To my knowledge that is not true and the there are two hops because the packet hits the gateway on the L3 switch and then hits the inside router interface before going out to the internet. Please correct me if I am mistaken. 

I had a consultant setup a basic network for a small office but I have some questions regarding the best way to implement this. We are using a Cisco 1921 router connected to a Catalyst 3750 as the main switch. Two more Catalyst 3750's branch off from the main switch for different suites. VLAN's are trunked through to the main 3750 where the gateways for each vlan/subnet reside (192.168.x.1). The router is performing NAT with the public IP on the outside interface connected to the ISP modem and a private IP on the inside interface facing the switched network. The things I am wondering about:
