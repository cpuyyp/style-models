You will most likely have a sub-key called "Command Prompt" that you want to store your information in. You should be able to script it from there. Here is a reference to what all the values mean. It is for Windows 2000, but this section still applies to Win7/2008. 

Here is an old KB article that describes a similar situation - perhaps the same fix will work for IIS6. 

If you are adding a filter at the site level, a restart is not required - but you do need to make at least 1 request to the website for the filter to "load". If you are adding a filter at the global level, a restart is required. $URL$ $URL$ 

The answer to the original question was that on Windows 2008 (due to UAC) you need to run STSADM from an administrative command prompt. See the comments on the question and Greg_the_Ant's updates for further discussion. 

Now, if you plan on implementing Search Server Express on top of WSS, I would say you need to up the ram to 8gb and put the search indexes out on some fast RAID 10. Here is the documentation for WSS performance planning: $URL$ And here is the link for Search Server: $URL$ 

If I attempt to start Plesk with the command I mentioned earlier 2 new entries, the same as the one above, are added to the error log. I have found some reference to this error log entry and these relate to an updated version of SSL breaking plesk, however I have not (to my knowledge) updated SSL (unless the install of sysstat did this in the background??) Output from is: 

Rather than copy the MDF files around, a better solution is to take a backup of the database and then restore that backup onto your target SQL instance. Assuming you are using SQL Management Studio, you can do this by right clicking on your database and choosing: 

Answering my own question here (which by no means devalues the answer from JakeGould) I have finally found the cause of this, rather than a writeup it is all neatly summarised on this page: $URL$ Using the guidance on that page (and the linked articles) I looked at loaded Apache modules and found mod_view_proxy.so which is not a known Apache Module. This was being loaded into Apache via a LoadModule directive in /etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf. All files had been touched so the datetime stamp on them do not look suspicious. As blog entry mentions the SSHD had also been replaced with a different version. As to how it got compromised, not entirely sure - the assumption is that it was caused by running and older version of vBulletin and/or one of its plugins (which is entirely my fault). Also I need to give these guys their dues: $URL$ As you can see from this thread I had exhausted all ideas I had and also my technical ability, so as a last resort I went to Sucuri with everything I knew and had done. Yes, its a paid service but they found the issue, resolved it - their service was fantastic. They were genuinely interested in helping me navigate through this issue, a level service we don't often see these days. I have nothing but praise for them and would not hesitate to recommend them to anybody in my position. 

The documentation on QEMU is not really clear; using the "-smp <num of cores>" option allows you to emulate more than one CPU, but it is not clear if this is real smp across multiple host cores, or effectively "threads" bound to a single core. VMware products do spread the load across multiple cores, but be careful about scheduling issues with busy guests which will impact overall performance. More info here. 

Consider an isolated VLAN with a heavily restricted bastion host facilitating access. Access to the devices not only requires knowledge of and access to the bastion host, but also access to the lights-out management device, most of which can be configured to have a separate authentication scheme. You can further restrict access by applying ACL's to restrict access to the bastion host so that connections can only come from authorised management stations. 

Those sort of symptoms are usually caused by an functional boot loader, but it can't find the kernel. I'll assume you've also tried to boot the ESX Recovery GRUB option and found it didn't work. Given you've just rebuilt the array, I'd be concerned that the rebuild was destructive and hosed your box. If it was rebuilt to replace a dead disk, it's unlikely, but certainly not out of the realm of possibility for a RAID card with bugs or another form of hardware stupidity. If it was rebuilt to change RAID levels, it's almost certain the array is hosed. Try creating an ESXi USB stick and boot from that; you may be able to convince it to read your storage to see what's left on disk. If your VM's and VMFS datastores are intact, you could use ESXi to run them until your next maintenance window, or reinstall ESX to restore full functionality (being very careful to not destroy your datastores). Good luck. 

I would get a 403 error back, however all I am seeing is page.php. Conclusion is that the directives are malformed and not being followed. Could anybody offer any guidance on where I may have gone wrong? 

EDIT 3 As the errors in the log seem to point to the issue that whose resolution is detailed here: $URL$ I have followed the guidelines in that KB, with the following outputs: 

I have been staring at this for a while not I can't fathom it, probably a wood for the trees scenario. I am attempting to use HTACCESS to block certain inputs to a web server, so I have added the following directives: 

I am looking through the modules that my apache server has loaded. To get this list I am using the following command: 

In the list this provides there are a number of modules that I don't immediately recognise, specifically: 

Using the guide here: $URL$ I have create a certificate authority using OpenSSL. However I would now like to use the Microsoft CA instead. The question is, is it possible to "import" the root/sub certificates I created with OpenSSL into MSCA? 

If you have Visio 2007 Pro, there is a feature to reverse engineer an existing database - it will read your database and create a Visio chart with all of the tables and relationships mapped. $URL$ One caution when using it with SQL Server - I've always had problems using the SQL Server driver directly. Instead, I tend to have to use the "Generic OLE DB Provider" and then select the SQL Server OLE DB provider within that. 

According to this article, yes it does. The combination of Indexing Server and NTFS should make it so that any change to the file (including ACL) is indexed pretty instantaneously though, so they should never be out of date. Even if they are out of sync - if the actual file on the file system is more restrictive than what is indexed, the user will still not be able to view it. The worst that happens is they can see that the file exists (and any abstract/other properties you have setup.) 

What you are seeing is actually a new feature in Windows Server 2008 R2. NTLM and Negotiate are the same as the were in older versions of IIS. You are correct that Negotiate = Kerberos for the purposes of this discussion - but Negotiate can also fall back to NTLM if it cannot authenticate using Kerberos. 2008 R2 added a new feature in IIS called "Negotiable 2" (called Nego2 a lot in documentation/blogs) which allows new authentication providers like LiveID to work with IIS. One of the additional benefits of Nego2 is that it allows you to have a Kerberos/Negotiate authentication provider that does not fall back to NTLM if it can't authenticate. That is the new "Negotiate:Kerberos" provider you are seeing. The downside of this is that to use Nego2 providers (including Negotiate:Kerberos) you must disable kernel-mode authentication, which can decrease performance and cause other problems depending on your configuration. 

Depending on your server, it may perform Console Redirection over an inbuilt serial port; by using a USB-to-Serial adapter (if your laptop does not come with a serial port), you can get access to POST messages and the BIOS by using serial terminal emulator program ('screen' works well for this task, if you're unix friendly). Your server may also support Serial Over LAN, accessible using IPMI tools talking to the server's Baseboard Management Controller. After configuring the BMC appropriately, you should be able to obtain access to the console over the wire. 

Depends on where the servers live. As with most everyone else, PXE booting/install is by far my first choice (and is absolutely trivial with ESXi). In some cases, PXE booting is not appropriate or available (think secure DMZ's). In this case, installing using the server's out-of-band Lights Out Management CD redirection functionality means I can do it from my desk without hanging out in the datacenter or needing to reconfigure one of the host's switch ports to a more netboot-friendly network. As for host configuration, configuration can be scripted using the v(I)MA toolkit or virtual appliance, although these tools have some functional limitations. vSphere (ESX4) makes this even easier if you have licenses which include the Host Profiles functionality (configure one host correctly, define it as your host profile configuration source, apply config to all other hosts in the cluster. It will check daily to make sure the hosts are still compliant with their "golden" configuration). Note that not all configuration can be scripted via v(I)MA or be managed under Host Profiles; some manual processes are required to complete host configuration due to some configuration options not being available through these tools. In this case, a written procedure or checklist will ensure you don't miss anything. 

It is hard to tell from your list - have you installed updated drivers and BIOS firmware? I've had this same issue twice in the past (both on Dell servers). Once it was outdated drivers for a video card, the other time it was outdated BIOS firmware. 

So your users only ever go to $URL$ and $URL$ - NLB takes care of the routing to the 3 hosts. It also handles an outage of one of the hosts by not routing traffic to that host. Within the My Sites settings, you tell it the host is $URL$ and again the load balancing will handle the routing to the individual servers. 

This option was removed in Server 2008 as a security enhancement. This is because the application runs as the cluster service account which has elevated privileges. Even in 2003 clusters, the security best practice was to not have this checked. 

What are you trying to achieve by using web gardens? If it is increased performance, then definitely do NOT do this. Web gardens, while advertised by Microsoft documentation and books as increasing performance, typically tend to decrease it - especially if the bottleneck in your application is the cpu. What they are used for is if you are having reliability problems (your application pools keep crashing) - the web garden can make your application more reliable, but you will probably take a performance penalty for that. Here is a great blog post that walks through whether you should use web gardens or not: $URL$ Also, here is Microsoft's documentation on when it could make sense to use a web garden for performance reasons - but maybe take it with a grain of salt: $URL$ 

Addition for clarity: From a business perspective, clients want make sure they can always get in touch with someone to help them, yet have access to specific staff members for client/account management or higher level support/sales when appropriate. To achieve this goal, my recommendation is to use both both techniques; staff should have personalised/named accounts, and be members of a alias or mailing/distribution list for their department, role or branch -- whatever delineation makes sense. What address is given out or used then becomes a business decision of expected follow up / personal contact / historical knowledge required, staff turnover and how "general" client requests are (example, password resets can be performed by any helpdesk staff member) For front line customer-facing roles, departments with high turnover or where requests can be completed by any staff member, clients can be provided the alias (support@, sales@, reception@) for that department, guaranteeing someone from that department will receive their mail and be able to look after them. When a staff member leaves or changes role, it then becomes a matter of changing the alias or mailing list subscription. For roles where a high level of personal contact, historical knowledge, or where the work can only be performed by specific staff members, contact can be made using the named account. I'd recommend the client should be provided with an alias address as well so they are not left out in the cold when a staff member leaves the company or is on leave. 

As a possibly related issue, today I experience a server outage for reasons yet unknown. As part of the investigation into this I used Plesk to reboot the server. This action completed successfully and was the last action I performed in Plesk. Since the reboot I can access all services other than plesk itself. Having never encountered this issue before, and also being something of a newbie when it comes to administering a Linux based server, I have no idea where to go next? Is there are log file I can check for service start errors? Is the solution staring me in the face? Or maybe something else. Thanks in advance EDIT Something else that may or may not be relevant: After rebooting, and before attempting to access Plesk again I installed sysstat with yum in order to be able to use iostat. Other than that no other changes have been made to the server. EDIT 2 The last entry in the file is 

To be honest there are quite literally hundreds, maybe tens, of ways of doing this. Personally I would use a simple batch file that maps a network drive (net use) and then copies the files. Rather than copy or xcopy I would recommend using robocopy as this support functions such as mirroring. As for executing installers, thats a different question entirely. For this you could use remote command (rcmd) to execute the installer once you have copied it across. 

The VBS script you use can't be just a generic VBS script - there are certain methods that it must implement (even if you just define the function and it does nothing). Perhaps this is your problem? Check out this MSDN page for some information on how to write a generic script and what functions you must implement. 

but you need to recompile nginx to get this support - it isn't enabled by default. See this blog post for more details. 

Here is a little utility I've used for "warming up" SharePoint sites in the past. I don't see why it wouldn't work for a non-SharePoint website. 

Based on your requirements - you are most interested in Web Content Management, which WSS isn't great at but you can make it workable. The big things in your list that are missing from WSS compared to MOSS are related to previewing and approving page content before publishing (and the built-in workflows related to such.) You should be able to create custom libraries with (custom-built) workflows attached that add this functionality though. There is a codeplex project that supposedly adds some of this stuff without you having to do the work manually: $URL$ but I can't vouch for how good it is. Also, SharePoint (both WSS and MOSS) do WYSIWYG stuff out of the box, but some people find it...lacking. If your users have non-IE web browsers, there is basically no WYSIWYG support. Even if you are an IE only shop, I would recommend adding the (free) Telerik RadEditor component to your installation. 

You'll need to prepend the /opt/subversion version in the shell's path to have the environment prefer the new version. The software's README states: 

You haven't explicitly mentioned which product, so I'm going to assume the tag of "vmware-server" is accurate. I'm also assuming you are running your old server as a VM on top of your new server install. The feature you're looking for is known Raw Device Mapping (Server 1, ESX, ESXi) or SCSI Passthrough in Server 2. RDM's work great in ESX/ESXi; anecdotal evidence on SCSI passthrough in Server is mixed. The procedure, according to the documentation for Server 2 (page 157): 

A really easy way to find out is to create an ESXi USB stick, assuming your laptop will boot from USB. If it works, awesome! Go find it some storage and see how it goes. If not, you've only lost 15 minutes of your day. The best bit... you haven't trashed your laptop in the process (unless you wipe the drive to become a datastore). Obviously, performance likely won't be stunning, but it might be Good Enough(tm) to test one or two VM's. That said, I run a half dozen VM's reasonably well on a single CPU/single core desktop PC with 3 GB of RAM, booting ESXi4 from a USB stick (used to get around a weird SATA controller quirk). Horribly unsupported configuration, but works great for a lab :)
