I've never had anything installed on the nand memory before and on my other cubieboard nandinstall worked just fine. 

The huge number of processes was caused by Crashplan crashing due to running out of memory. It tried to restart itself once a minute, but it immediately crashed again, spawning new copies of these processes after each restart. The memory was capped by the java process at 1GB, but I needed about 3GB of heap. For some reason, they seem to store the entire index of all backed up files in memory. The hotfix was to allow it to use 4gigs of memory; . The slowness/artifacts of the task manager was probably because I was running thousands of processes; apparently they didn't test that use-case. I guess that they're redrawing the screen based on a wall-clock timer, and that didn't finish drawing the screen before having to start drawing the next one. 

Chrome has always claimed to be about performance. The super fast browser I installed years ago does not seem that super fast anymore. Is there some list of benchmarks under different versions of chrome, so that I can compare chrome 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 etc. to each other? The "improved speed/performance" in the release notes isn't helping, because they never write "decreased speed/performance" or by how much. 

In this condition I do not think You can fix it via ssh. Do You have access to any form of console (e.g.: serial)? How did You create (or where did You get) Your RootFS? If You have access to console try: 

Is it possible to rsync a real filesystem (remote) with a tar archive (local)? If so, how? Problem is I need to correctly backup user/group/permission settings and, while I have root access on remote I would like to avoid running as root on the local machine. My first (and foremost) usage case would be to update a remote embedded target (ARM9) from a .tar produced by Buildroot. I do not have the "real thing" on disk (I can produce a copy while being root) and I would like to avoid transferring the whole rootfs to update a few files. 

create a temp directory unpack tar archive into it rysnc as needed if something changed locally repack int a new tar archive cleanup 

After a bit of investigation I found out can do what I need. Here comes an excerpt from standard documentation (Dnsmasq setup): 

I need a psychiatrist for my PC. It is convinced it is an iMac (sort of). Seriously: I have a problem which popped up apparently from nowhere, most likely due to some upgrade with "side effects", but I really do not know what happened. Granted, I have a rather convolute setup: 

As a general answer of how to open a new copy/window of any program in the taskbar that is already open, right-clicking the icon and clicking the name of the program works. Example: right-click the Chrome icon, select "Google Chrome" and a new window of Chrome pops up. Some apps simply don't allow more than once window open at a time, such as Spotify. 

but it still cannot connect to the smtp server. It seems really weird that outlook cannot connect to their own servers... What have I done wrong? Does anyone know how to do this? 

I have a student mail at my university which is setup to redirect all incoming emails to my old hotmail/outlook free account. I also want to be able to send emails from my free account, as the student account (without using masquerade). The university uses the microsoft lisam suite and outlook free apparently doesn't find their smtp server. the guide on lisam outlook says this: 

Resizing the window from the bottom and dragging it to the edge of the screen to activate the snap function worked. 

Just wondering, any OS, any computer. What if I accidentally double-tap the key? Or what if the screensaver wasn't on? I'm guessing and are quite bad, along with and hitting the middle of the keyboard with a fist. Which one is the safest? ? 

In the end I added both DNS "special server" and additional static routes to my main dnsmasq (on my firewall) and everything works as needed as soon as the VPN Virtual Machine is up-and-running. Actual lines added to my dnsmasq.conf are: 

I have a router running, among other things, with standard setup, so I get DNS proxy plus additional local servers, plus name resolution for all machines whose IP address is managed via DHCP server. Servers and other hosts are on my domain So far so good. Now I need to connect via VPN to a customer site () who has a very similar setup (they are not using dnsmasq, but net effect is the same). I set up a small (virtual) machine acting as router forwarding (with NAT) from local network to IPSec device and added a few static routes to the (2) hosts needing to see customer.net; I did this manually instead of pushing the routes through dnsmasq. Also this seems to work without problems. Now I have the last problem I don't know how to solve: I can access machines in private address space only specifying the IP address, no DNS resolution is available from How can I access without losing connection with ? NOTE: I can modify my setup (I would prefer to limit changes to the few hosts actually involved), but I have no control on Situation I would like to have is: 

I just opened Wunderlist (the one from the Windows store) and the top half is off-screen. Right-clicking the icon in the task bar and selecting move no longer works, since it's not there. Accessing the move command in the menu bar through the keyboard as suggested here doesn't work. How do I get it back on screen? (and why is this still an issue, so many years later?) 

Linux and OS X are caching files from disk in RAM, whenever you have unused memory. Is there a way to do the same in Windows 10? Right now it's doing its best to keep my memory usage at 33% or 45% all the time, by compressing things. Would putting temporary files on a ramdisk have the effect I want, albeit with a static size? 

I'm running a fairly high end computer at around 30% load. For some reason, task manager is very slow. I'm getting black artifacts, the tabs aren't always loading and sometimes it just freezes. Everything else seems to work just fine. For some reason, it's running with normal priority, rather than above normal, and I cannot change it. Maybe this changed with Windows 10? What can I do about this, other than reinstalling Windows? Is it enough to suspect something messing with task manager, like a rootkit trying to stay hidden? EDIT: apparently I have a few thousand and running with no parent process. Smallest processid is 224, which is before login. There are also 470k handles open. This will require some digging. 

I have a very basic Win7 usage problem: My PC has an Italian keyboard, but I need to work with an US-English environment (Win7 is in English). Problem is in many programs (most notably in PowerPoint) system defaults to Italian settings (including dictionary checking) and I have to change them every time. This is particularly nasty in Power Point because I have to change Language in each TextBox I create. Need is to work with a full US-English Locale but to have a different Keyboard. I was unable to find the right setting (and the fact the laptop is actually French and Power Point templates I need to use come from Germany add confusion to chaos). Language bar seems to govern keyboard together all other Locale settings (which usually makes sense, of course). How can I separate them? Here are screenshots of relevant panels, as requested: --- NOTE: strange thing is everything seems to work as expected today, even if I do not recall changing anything since yesterday. Did the system need a restart to actualize settings? Anyways problem seems solved. Sorry for the noise. 

Sure enough solves the issue, but it will be back at next VM boot. How can I set this permanently? (note I have no local xserver on VM, so I don't have a and similar files) I would also like to understand what happened. Can someone suggest where to look?
