I think Ubuntu Server is still the best path for you if you want something that "works almost exactly like Ubuntu." You can choose to not install many server-related features during the installation and I'd expect any remaining "server overheads" would be mitigated by not having a GUI installed. 

Experience: I had a similar issue recently. I had RDP set to run full screen which turned out that the resolution was too high to support 32 bit color, so it was dropping back down to 16 bit automatically and silently. As soon as I ran the remote desktop at a lower resolution, 32 bit color worked as expected. 

Why? Because your concentrations are less than 1 so the logarithms are negative values. To fix, format the x-axis and select Vertical axis crosses: Axis value and supply a value smaller than your minimum x-axis value. 

Right click the shortcut, select Properties, select Compatibility tab, check the "Run as Administrator" box. 

Consider using the following rsync options: to increase the verbosity to itemize changes If you want to see the changes before syncing, you can use the above options with the option to do a dry run. 

With the rectangular marquee tool you can change the style between Normal, Fixed Ratio and Fixed Size. The latter two options should achieve what you're after. 

Windows DVD Maker is a component of Windows 7 Home Premium and above. It is very easy to take a sequence of images and apply a soundtrack to them. It doesn't just burn to DVD - you can also save to file. 

I can't offer a generic solution but in the particular case you describe you can press Ctrl + J three times when the main Firefox window has focus. 1st time - bring Downloads window to foreground 2nd time - close Downloads window 3rd time - open Downloads window End result is that the main Firefox window preview is displayed to the left of the Downloads preview. 

sets the input field separator to comma sets the output field separator to comma matches and prints any lines where the fourth field is 37 This creates a new file, : 

I've had good results with FastPictureViewer Codec Pack. This is commerical software but the price is low. 

Assuming your data are valid Excel datetimes, give your range a title (eg. "Datetime") and then create a Pivot Table. Use Datetime (or whatever you called it) as your Row Labels and your Values. Make sure the Values function is Count, not Sum. Finally, group your Row Labels by Month and optionally by Year. 

Hard to say without knowing your typical disk usage and how you configure your system. For example, how much RAM will you allow ZFS to use? The parity calculations between RAID-Z1 and RAID 5 would probably have similar overheads. 

Setting this property will only affect new data written, so you should set it during or immediately after creating your pool and filesystem(s). 

You can add the stars (asterisks) to the numbers with a custom format (eg. 0.000"***") but only for cells containing numbers. If you have cells containing digits followed by asterisks then Excel treats the cell as text, not as numbers, so you won't be able to apply number custom formats or do arithmetic on them. I suggest you try to split your numbers and asterisks into adjacent cells (two columns). 

Not necessarily. HDMI devices supporting audio transmission MUST support 2-channel L-PCM but there are a variety of other optional audio formats allowed by the HDMI 1.4b specification. 

Try to force your profile to a particular location without opening the the last used profile... Edit to be something like this: 

Process Monitor from Microsoft's SysInternals team should do what you need. From the site: "Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity." Note: Process Monitor is a different utility to the excellent Process Explorer from the same authors. 

You can programmatically access this file using the SQLite API or interactively using an SQLite manager such as SQLite Expert. It is wise to open it read-only or otherwise make sure Chrome is closed before accessing it. The table is a good place to start. 

For bulleted lists, type and then press Tab. You can start other styles of lists with similar shortcuts. For numbered lists, type , or and then press Tab. You can also use or for lowercase or uppercase lettered lists, with your choice of brackets or period. For Roman numeral lists, use or . 

Xmarks is great for this via bookmarks. Edit: I just realised you want current tabs synchronised. I don't think Xmarks will be the solution for you. 

On Windows versions of Excel you can use Ctrl + Page Up/Page Down to move between worksheets and holding down Shift while doing so will allow you to select multiple (adjacent) worksheets. 

I generally rename all video clips and images to YYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext format to reflect the time they were shot. 

If your cell values are going to remain static then you can apply a custom number format individually for each cell. For example, select your cell containing 1 and apply the custom number format "Monday" (or "Sunday", depending on your preference). Then similarly for the cell with 2, its own custom format, and so on. If your cells values will be dynamic (in the range 1..7) then you might be able to use conditional formatting but it would be awkward. 

Try putting the filename template in double quotes. Also, if you are running the command in a script you may need to use %% instead of %. 

This is a pivot chart as opposed to a regular chart in Excel. Pivot charts are closely related to pivot tables and you can find an introduction to them both here. Your data layout is not optimised for pivoting but you can probably generate the memory chart as shown with no changes. 

To isolate the non-number values in the range you can apply Conditional Formatting using a similar formula. Hint: To create an array formula, press Ctrl + Shift+ Enter instead of Enter when entering/editing the cell. 

I won't vouch for its functionality and outdated GUI but it is installed by default, even on Windows 7. Edit: Except 64 bit versions of Windows. 

You can exclude blanks from the result by using the drop down menu on but there is a trick. The contents of the drop down are dependent on what cell is currently active in the pivot table. Make sure that one of the Country names is selected, or '(blank)', and then open the drop down menu. You can deselect (blank) and it will be removed from the aggregates. 

This will locate files with no extension () on C:\ and all subdirectories () and exclude directory names (). This will only locate files based on name. It won't address your other criteria of file size or contents. 

The earliest models such as the 701 had two physical SSD drives, typically 4GB and 16GB, so you cannot merge them at the partition level. Under XP your best option is to mount the larger drive as a folder on the smaller (system) file system. 

You can use the -n option with rsync to perform a dry run. rsync will tell you what operations it would have performed without actually doing them. If you're happy with the results, re-run without the -n option. 

Use and/or to combine the data within a row and use ...... to insert the line break for the row. Turn on Wrap text for the cell holding the result so that the line break is displayed properly. Your columns will probably not line up correctly because the cells' contents have variable lengths will probably be displayed with a proportional font. For best results you should use a fixed width font and use the and functions to determine and insert the appropriate amount of spaces between your data. For example, to make sure the data in cell A1 is padded out with spaces to make a column 20 characters wide, 

When running the main installation you will be asked whether you want to install the server components, the client components or both. I have not seen the client components available seperately. Prerequisites to a successful client install generally require the server components to already be installed and the license server services to be running. All the documentation is on the SAP Business One Customer Portal. You are given log in credentials when you purchase Business One. I'm not aware of any open-source equivalents to SAP Business One. 

Using a text editor or some scripting you could transform your text file to a POV-Ray scene description using the object. 

Install ExifTool for Windows to somewhere in your PATH and rename it to Then you can use the following command to update the Title field for each JPG file in the current directory: 

Your key is probably an OEM SLP key which is unlikely to work with a retail CD or System Builder OEM CD. 

As you can see from the second option (above), it's entirely possible to open the workbook without updating the linked data and not even alert the user. Also, when working with data connections (similar to linked workbooks but usually database queries) you can choose whether or not to embed the external data in the workbook as shown below. 

I automatically rename all my files by the capture time - YYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext - as I download them from my cards. There are many applications that do this. Lightroom is my current tool of choice. I have a couple of cameras and using this scheme rarely causes name clashes and they're easy to fix during import. 

is very versatile. You could also use it to combine multiple CSV files and strip the header. It comes standard on Linux and MacOS and Windows versions are available. 

I get this behaviour (black screen, flashing cursor) if I have certain brands of USB flash drives plugged in during boot, regardless of the boot order. When I remove all flash drives and reboot, Windows starts normally. 

Microsoft explains this in relation to Vista and the same would apply for its inclusion in Windows 7. 

You can't extend the existing raidz1 vdev by adding another disk but you can add another vdev to the pool to increase the pool's capacity. You'll need more than one additional disk if you want to retain redundancy. For example, you could use two disks to add a mirror vdev or 3+ disks for another raidz1 vdev. 

into Wolfram Alpha. It returns the result (and many other types of info) in graphical format but you can also have it converted to Mathematica text form. 

Then you can create your pivot table as follows: Report filter: none Column labels: none Row labels: Role, Member Values: MIN of Weeks since Then: 

You probably want an X-Y scatter plot with lines. X = year, Y = quantity sold. A normal line chart treats the X values as labels whereas an X-Y scatter plot treats the X values as true values. 

A non-RAID option is to mount the second HDD as a junction in the first HDD. To do this, create an empty folder on the first HDD and the, in Disk Management, assign the second drive to the empty folder instead of assigning it a drive letter. This is a very simple way to do it but you only get the additional capacity with that particular folder. 

So substituting i=8 in the above formula will give you the sum of the first 8 rows in column A. The formula can easily be extended to account for ranges starting at other rows. As far as I'm aware, Excel only supports 2^20 (1048576) rows.
