I tried to explore some of the best available resources, which includes online courses (Free/Paid), Books etc. Books 

You can use any but as per your data I would recommend you to go with . For chart-codes and description you can try- One Chart, Twelve Charting Libraries If you need any other help on this update me. I would help to help. Cheers! :) 

I tried to look for some resources of your interest and came up with these online courses available at eDX- 

Data Analyst A data analyst's role is one that works with lots of data to derive meaningful insights to either address business problems or discover hidden trends and patterns that can be leveraged to meet the business objectives. Data Analyst Skillset- 

Any thoughts on that? How to sort it out? Update >> My version is . I tried to install the update but it's kept on saying- No matching distribution found for the upgrade. 

It was hard to look for anything based on the information. Still, I found this interesting paper- Augmented Functional Time Series Representation and Forecasting with Gaussian Processes on the web. Just explore it. Hope it will help you upto some extent. Cheers! 

Now, by adding/subtracting the input vector to the weight vector you make sure that this data input vector is now correctly classified. You also make sure, that you decrease the distance of your weight vector by a sufficient margin (at least the length of the input vector) towards the cone of all possible solutions. 

If you have multiple different types in a Series, say and , all of the data will get upcasted to the same (as you can see from your example). 

You should think about how the initial values impact the ReL Units. If, for example, you use for the layer you'll get the desired result (in this simple setup). 

Decision trees are generally prone to over-fitting and accuracy doesn't generalize well to unseen data. One advantage of information gain is that -- due to the factor $-p*log(p)$ in the entropy definition -- leafs with a small number of instances are assigned less weight ($lim_{p \rightarrow 0^{+} } p*log(p) = 0$) and it favors dividing data into bigger but homogeneous groups. This approach is usually more stable and also chooses the most impactful features close to the root of the tree. EDIT: Accuracy is usually problematic with unbalanced data. Consider this toy example: 

There are three main contenders Cloudera, MapR, and Hortonworks. But among all these 3 Cloudera and MapR are better solutions if money is not an issue and you'd like to get some advanced features. Cloudera has Impala which may be a killer feature for some. MapR has some unique HA attributes and uses a NFS compatible filesystem. MapR is supposedly the fastest Hadoop solution in the market. You can find more information on this on Quora Now for your 2nd question, go through these articles. 

Financial Analyst Financial analysts use financial data to spot trends and extrapolate into the future, helping their employers and clients make the best investing decisions. Businesses rely on financial analysts to determine when it is an auspicious time to buy or sell specific securities and, in some cases, companies use reports put together by financial analysts to determine if the entire business should be sold. Financial Analyst Skillset- 

As per your problem and the description, I'll suggest you to try Text Mining - Bag of Words approach. I did something similar using the same approach and it was really helpful. More details about the approach are here. Give it a try. Cheers! 

Keep in mind that while Naïve Bayes is a decent classifier for many applications, the generated probabilities are usually not very representative. 

If you only add parts of the vector (i.e. not update all weights) at each iteration, you cannot be sure that you make sufficient progress or even move in the right direction of the solution space. 

One reason that ReL Units have been introduced is to circumvent the problem of vanishing gradients of sigmoidal units at -1 and 1. Another advantage of ReL Units is that they saturate at exactly 0 allowing for sparse representations, which can be helpful when hidden units are used as input for a classifier. The zero gradient can be problematic in cases where the unit never activates in a gradient based scenario when the unit is initially not activated. This problem can be alleviated by using leaky ReL Units. On the other hand, leaky ReL Units don't have the ability to create a hard-zero sparse representation which can be useful in certain cases. So, there is a bit of a trade-off and, as in general with NN, it depends on the use cases when which unit performs better. In most cases, if the initial settings can make sure that the ReL Unit is activated (e.g. by setting the biases to small positive values) one would expect ReL and leaky Rel Units to perform very similarly. 

These are just the few resources, that might get your attention and may be useful for you. In addition to that, you can explore eDX - DS Dashboard for more such courses, go to Github there are lots of systematic Data Science stuff from scratch showing how things are done at professional end, setuping things up etc. Hope it helps! 

My Rationale In my case am doing both and using them interactively and Customizing them as per my use. You can get something really interesting in one (as I mentioned above) which will be hardly available in other, so it's better to use both together. This is the best way to bridge the gap between these two. But in the last, it's your call keep the guidelines, your interest, and scenarios in mind and make a clear view on that.

Online Courses These are some best platforms that provide lots of courses with rich content and hands-on labs. You can go from beginner to expert level, followed by intermediate. (courses will be - Free/Paid ) 

If I get you right, then you can use any of the below libraries. These are simple to use and you can customize them as per your requirement. The libraries are-- 

I think the documentation, at least for your example, is not too obscure. It doesn't tell you what kind of interpolation it uses because it doesn't use any: is a deferred operation. In order for it to work you have to call it in conjunction with a function that performs the interpolation, e.g. or (as can be seen from the examples in the documentation). Sometimes, it can be helpful to also look into the release notes for additional information. Scipy and Numpy are sometimes not very detailed, but they contain at least a decent number of references with more information. (There is also a section on Matlab versus Numpy here. If you are familiar with in R , then the pandas cheat sheet can help as a quick comparison between R and pandas for typical data wrangling operations.) I'm not aware of a "second more detailed documentation" that encompasses the entire libraries. You probably have to fall back to books (which, of course, aren't complete or always up to date). 

Since you have an inequality constraint you need to meet the necessary Kuhn-Tucker Conditions which for non-negativity constraints are: 

Solution 2 Adding percentages is a bit more involved as of now. You can easily do that by directly manipulate the object returned by a call to as- 

Use a Python package to use R within Python . [Demo] Use Python from within R using the . [Demo] Use with the . Python and R and makes the interactivity of iPython available to other languages. Use Beaker Notebook. It allows you to switch from one language in one code block to another language in another code block in a streamlined way to pass shared objects. 

So keep these factors and your goals in mind before approaching to any. For more details, I'll suggest you to go through these blog posts-- 

F-measure defined below helps to simplify precision and recall into a single metric. The resulting value makes comparison between algorithms and across data sets very simple and straightforward. 

See as I said earlier both are stable and you can choose any or work with both. But when it comes to master one I'll suggest keep these 3-4 guidelines in mind- Personal Preference Choose the language to begin with based on your personal preference, on which comes more naturally to you, which is easier to grasp from the get-go. To give you a sense of what to expect, mathematicians and statisticians tend to prefer R, whereas computer scientists and software engineers tend to favor Python. Project selection You can also make the Python vs. R call based on a project you know you’ll be working on in your data studies. If you’re working with data that’s been gathered and cleaned for you, and your main focus is the analysis of that data, go with R. If you have to work with dirty or jumbled data, or to scrape data from websites, files, or other data sources, you should start learning, or advancing your studies in, Python. Collaboration Once you have the basics of data analysis under your belt, another criterion for evaluating which language to further your skills in is what language your teammates are using. If you’re all literally speaking the same language, it’ll make collaboration—as well as learning from each other—much easier. Job market Jobs calling for skill in Python compared to R have increased similarly over the last few years. 

From the second graph it seems pretty easy to identify the outlier. You could probably just fit a simple polynomial (or some other function) and then flag all points that have a distance greater than 2 standard deviations (or whatever seems appropriate) from the fitted curve. 

depending on your application. Of course, if you don't want to define the categories beforehand, this can be done using some clustering technique etc. 

Your formula is correct for one $w_i$, but if you want to classify a document, you need to compute $P(c | w_1,\ldots,w_N)$. Then you have $$P(c | w_1,\ldots,w_N) = \frac{P(c)\cdot P(w_1,\ldots,w_N|c)}{P(w_1,\ldots,w_N)} = \frac{P(c) \cdot \prod_{i=1}^N P(w_i|c)}{P(w_1,\ldots,w_N)} \neq \prod_{i=1}^NP(c|w_i)$$ where the second equation holds because of the naïve Bayes assumption. For classification purposes you can ignore $P(w_1,\ldots,w_N)$ because it is constant (given the data). The formula is still simple ("naïve") but doesn't simplify quite as much. 

As mentioned python's pandas library is good start. They have a lot of time series functionality, see e.g. the documentation here. You can load your data like so: 

Then, for the circular contours, the optimal solution will be where the line $w^*_2 = C- w^*_1$ (for the boundary region) and the line through the red cross at $(r_1,r_2)$ running orthogonal to the boundary region intersect. You can see that the latter has the form $w_2 = f(w_1) = 1\cdot w_1 + r_2 - r_1$. (Orthogonality gives you slope +1 because the boundary region has slope -1.) Setting them equal gives you the intersection at coordinates $w^*_1 = \frac{C+r_1-r_2}{2}$ and $w^*_2 = \frac{C-r_1+r_2}{2}$. Now, if $r_2=r_1$ you have $w^*_1=w^*_2$ independent of $C$ and the solution won't be sparse. If $r_1>r_2$ (i.e. you are below the first diagonal) shrinking $C$ to $r_1-r_2>0$ yields $w^*_2=0$ but $w^*_1>0$. You end up in the right corner of the regularization region. (Similar to my image.) If $r_2>r_1$ (i.e. you are above the first diagonal) shrinking $C$ to $r_2-r_1>0$ yields $w^*_1=0$ but $w^*_2>0$. You end up in the top corner of the regularization region. (Similar to your image.) As Emre mentioned in the comments, this holds in general and you can "see" this from the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the optimization problem. 

As I can see you're searching for a case study. Learning from data is useful because you can learn both the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) and the structure of the network. The best resource I've read is a freely-available Microsoft tech report. Have a look at the paper, maybe it can help you upto some extend. I'll suggest you to start with of it. Hope it helps. Cheers! 

Coverage has to do with the percentage of items and users that a recommender system can provide predictions. Prediction may be practically impossible to make if no users or few users rated an item. Coverage can be reduced by defining small neighborhood sizes. That's all. Hope it helps! 

There are many more difference between these two. I found some really interesting answers for your question on Quora, have a look- 

Both are good stable languages with interesting complementary qualities. You can get much better packages in one and then stitch them with some data from the other. An example is using time series forecasting and decision trees in R and doing data munging in Python. Both languages borrow from each other. Even seasoned package developers like borrows from to make for web scraping. In addition to that, borrows from to make and many other. Rather than reinvent the wheel in the other language developers can focus on innovation because, in the end, the customer does not care which language the code was written, the customer cares for insights. 

It is not enough to set the derivative w.r.t. to $r$ to zero as is the case for equality constraints and Lagrange multipliers. Therefore, there are two cases to distinguish: 

The Gini Coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC): link. The ROC curve, on the other hand, is influenced by class imbalance through the false positive rate . If the number of negatives is a lot larger, this could be a potential issue. In short, the Gini Coefficient has similar pros and cons as the AUC ROC metric. 

If you pass , assumes that the first row contains data and names the columns '0' to '12'. Instead you should pass to specify that the column names are in the first row or equivalently skip the header argument. You can then still continue with , because calling returns a array without the column names. Alternatively, you could also select your feature columns like so: 

You can simply use the function in the basic {stats} package. If desired, this can also display a dendrogram to show clusters. For your sample data (with ) this would look something like this:
