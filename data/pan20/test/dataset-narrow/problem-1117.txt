I am not aware of any other general positive results on the direct-sum problem. However, it seems that for specific problems that are usually considered in communication complexity, e.g. equality or disjointness, a direct-sum theorem is known to hold. My question is, are there other examples of problems for which a deterministic communication complexity theorem is not known to hold, or even known not to hold (beside the function of [O90])?

The class $P^{SAT}$ contains $coNP$, so assuming $NP \ne coNP$, it cannot be contained in $NP$. On the other hand, if $NP = coNP$, then $P^{SAT}$ is contained in $NP$: if $NP = coNP$, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to $NP$, and since $P^{SAT}$ is contained in $\Sigma_2$, it would collapse to $NP$ as well. A more direct way to see it is as follows: Let $L\in P^{SAT}$ and let $M$ be a machine that decides it. The $NP$-proof system for $L$ works as follows. Given an input $x \in L$, the prover will provide the verifier the transcript of the run of $M$ on $x$, including the answer to each oracle query of $M$ and a proof that this answer is correct (such a proof exists for every answer by the assumption that $NP = coNP$). 

I think the $k$-clique cover problem, which asks whether there exists a partition of the vertices in $k$ sets such that each set induces a clique, has the desired properties. Clearly, taking induced subgraphs can't make the minimum size of such partition increase. On the other hand, when you take the disjoint union of two graphs, you have to take the union of the partition into cliques of each one. 

You can consider split graphs where vertices in the independent set have no common neighbor. It is easy to see that they can have large chromatic number (you can make the clique as big as you want) but their clique graphs are stars, which are bipartite. There are no direct correlation between the chromatic number of a graph an of its clique graph. Examples are the complete bipartite graphs (small-large), paths (small-small), the previous example (large-small) and the complement of a matching (large-huge). For the last one it is possible to show that the chromatic number of the original graph is $n/2$ and the chromatic number of its clique graph is $2^{n/2-1}$. You should also take a look at the chapter A Survey on Clique Graphs, by Jayme L. Szwarcfiter. 

Cubic graphs are graphs where every vertex has degree 3. They have been extensively studied and I'm aware that several NP-hard problems remain NP-hard even restricted to subclasses of cubic graphs, but some others get easier. A superclass of cubic graphs is the class of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta \leq 3$.

We cannot hope to prove a general impossibility result since if one-way functions exist (and we believe they do), then in particular it follows that the statement "If $P \ne NP$ then one-way functions exist" is true. However, we can prove that certain proof techniques are too weak to prove that statement. In particular, the following paper of Akavia, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Moshkovitz proves that this statement cannot be proved by certain black-box reductions (conditioned on plausible assumptions): $URL$ 

If you only care about the first variable, then I believe the following simple test should work: pick a random value $\beta \in \rm{GF}(q)$ and check that $f(\cdot, \beta)$ is a univariate polynomial of degree at most $d$ - say, by choosing few collections of $d+2$ points of the form $(\cdot,\beta)$ and interpolating them. The analysis of this test should be trivial: If the function is far from being of degree $d$ in the first variable, it must be far from a univariate polynomial of degree $\le d$ for many values of $\beta$. If you wish to test that $f$ is of degree $\le d$ in both variables, you can use the (highly non-trivial) result of Polischuk and Spielman from 1994, which is proved in Sections 2-5 in the following paper (see Theorem 9): $URL$ 

It is known that many logic problems (e.g. satisfiability problems of several modal logics) are not decidable. There are also many undecidable problems in algorithm theory, e.g. in combinatorial optimization. But in practice heuristcs and approximate algorithms works well for practical algorithms. So one can expect that approximate algorithms for logic problems can be suitable as well. However the only reseach trend along these lines I have managed to find is the max-SAT problem and its development was active in nineties. Are there some other active research trends, workshops, keywords, good references for the use and development of approximate methods for modal logics, logic programming and so on? If automated reasoning is expected to gain prominence in the future applications of computer science then one will have to be able to go beyond undecidability constraints of logics and approximate methods or heuristics can be natural path to follow, isn't it so? 

Hoare logic can be used for proving program correctness (e.g. for deriving correctness statements for the whole program from the statements for the individual commands or constructions; good summary is $URL$ The question is - is there any line of research where Hoare-style reasoning can be made for programs that creates and deletes objects. One thought can be that this reasoning can be simulated by defining large pool of objects which have (for the purposes of correctness analysis) additional state attribute with values from the enumeration {not-created, created, destroyed}. But I guess that better approach should exist. Are there any references or keywords for furher search into this matter. 

Let $X$ be a random variable taking values in $\Sigma^n$ (for some large alphabet $\Sigma$), which has very high entropy - say, $H(X) \ge (n- \delta)\cdot\log|\Sigma|$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\delta$. Let $E \subseteq \rm{Supp}(X)$ be an event in the support of $X$ such that $\Pr[X \in E] \ge 1 - \varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We say that a pair $(i,\sigma)$ is a low probability coordinate of $E$ if $\Pr[X \in E | X_i = \sigma] \le \varepsilon$. We say that a string $x \in \Sigma^n$ contains a low probability coordinate of $E$ if $(i, x_i)$ is a low probability coordinate of $E$ for some $i$. In general, some strings in $E$ may contain low probability coordinates of $E$. The question is can we always find a high probability event $E' \subseteq E$ such that no string in $E'$ contains a low probability coordinate of $E'$ (and not of $E$). Thanks! 

It is known that if $E = DTIME(2^{O(n)})$ is not contained in $SIZE(2^{\varepsilon \cdot n})$ for some $\varepsilon>0$ then $BPP = P$ ($URL$ (Actually, a slightly stronger assumption is needed, namely, the separation between $E$ and $SIZE(2^{\varepsilon \cdot n})$ should hold for almost all input lengths - thanks to Ryan O'Donnel for pointing it out.) More generally, this paper gives a direct optimal translation of any circuit lower bound into a corresponding derandomization result: $URL$
