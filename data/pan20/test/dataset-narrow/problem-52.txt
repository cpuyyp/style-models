Your question says that you are only using one criterion of the four criteria that identify a unique TCP connection. As you discovered, each time an HTTP client requests a connection to an HTTP server, it will use a different, random TCP address, know as an ephemeral port. There is a port range in your OS (varies by OS) for these ephemeral ports. The IANA recommendation for ephemeral ports is to use ports to , but different OSes use different ranges. 

You need to weigh several factors to determine which method to use in different places on your network. Different network engineers will come up with different recommendations. This is really leading to opinion-based answers, and it is probably better suited for a discussion on Network Engineering Chat. Cisco has some guidance that you should understand: Chapter: Configuring EtherChannels 

Aside from the problems of your IP math, broadcasts are bounded by routers. The Limited-Broadcast address () can never cross a router. A network broadcast address (the "all ones" or highest address in the network) cannot cross a router, by default, but routers may be configured to send directed broadcasts. A directed broadcast is sent to the broadcast address of a different network. Sending something to the broadcast address of your own network will never cross a router. That means that anything on the network to its broadcast address () will only ever be seen on that network. If a host on the network sends something to the broadcast address of the network (), it will be dropped by the router, unless the router is configured to forward directed broadcasts. The hosts on the local network will never see it because it will be sent to the router layer-2 address, not the layer-2 broadcast address. Remember that layer-3 packets get encapsulated in layer-2 frames, which are used to deliver traffic on the local layer-2 LAN. Ethernet, and other LAN protocols that use MAC addressing, will use the broadcast MAC address for broadcasts on the local layer-2 LAN. The host sending to the broadcast address of a different layer-3 network will understand that it is on a different network because of its network mask, and it will use the MAC address of its configured gateway for the frame, not the broadcast MAC address. 

Edit: Since you completely changed the question (very bad form), I will attempt to answer the new question. You are still very confused about how fragmentation works. With an original payload of octets passing through a router to a network with an MTU of you would get: 

MAC address filtering itself does not provide much protection. As you pointed out, a MAC address can be cloned. That doesn't mean it can't be part of the overall defense strategy, but it can be a lot of work for very little return. You need a comprehensive security policy which can include such things as: 

You can disable the power for any 6509 slot with the command. Commands such as these are very easy to find on Cisco's web site. Cisco maintains extensive documentation on its products. A simple search turned up Power Management for Catalyst 6000 Series Switches. 

Cisco has documentation for this. It may be simpler to think about the interaction with redistribution. The following example is from Defining Route Maps and an identical example in Route-Maps for IP Routing Protocol Redistribution Configuration: 

With VTP, you can mark VLANs as eligible to be pruned for a trunk link. When pruning is enabled in VTP, the eligible VLANs will be pruned if there is nothing downstream of the trunk link using those VLANs. This Cisco document shows how to configure VTP pruning and how to add VLANs to the pruning eligible list. 

There are various calculations (Erlang), depending on the business model, to determine the number of outside lines you should have based on the number of users. This is almost never close to one-to-one, but there are exceptions, depending on the type of business. 

RB1 and RB2 in AS100 do not know about the OSPF routes of R1, R2 and R3, unless RB1 and RB2 are also running OSPF, or one of the other routers is running BGP, and the routers running both protocols redistribute routes between OSPF and BGP. Routers do not share routes unless they run a common routing protocol between them. OSPF and BGP maintain their own tables. A router will select the best route (or use a tie breaker, like AD, in the case of equal paths) from the various routing protocols it is running to insert into its routing table, but the routing protocols do not share routes. Unless RB1 learns, in some way, about the OSPF routes of R1, R2, and R3, it will never share those with AS200, and vice versa. BGP doesn't even advertise routes unless the routes are in the routing table of the BGP router, and the BGP router uses the network statements for the routes, or the routes have been redistributed into BGP. One mistake that people often make is assuming that you can simply add a network statement to advertise a route in a routing protocol, but that is not true. BGP must have the exact route in the routing table, and network statements only tell OSPF which interfaces to include in the routing process. 

The encoding is used by the Physical Layer, not the Network Layer. Basically, NRZ,and its variants, are binary (two level) encoding, and there is no zero, or neutral, level. This is in contrast to RZ, e.g. Bipolar, where you have both positive, negative, and neutral (zero) levels. 

Your first question, "When does an device emit the 'Who has IP' message?" is the only on-topic question. What you are seeing is an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request. ARP is used to resolve a layer-3, e.g. IPv4, address to a layer-2 ,e.g. MAC, address. 

Tunneling involves encapsulating the packets to be tunneled inside an outer packet. The tunneled packets are the payload of the encapsulating packets. You will be creating a new IPv4 packet header to encapsulate the IPv6 packets, just as if the IPv6 packets were TCP segments. The new IPv4 packet headers don't really care what is in the payload, other than to set the Protocol field of the IPv4 header. 

There is really no way for a remote server to know if two clients are on the same local network. Even with the same public address, you can't know that they are not across the country from each other since they may belong to a company with multiple sites that uses a central proxy or firewall using NAT. 

A more specific route is what is used to forward packets. The two prefixes you have are really that, two separate prefixes, just as if they were in completely different network blocks. You are trying to compare apples to oranges If, on the other hand, the the prefixes were equal length, the static route would be used (assuming default ADs are used). 

You don't have OSPF configured on both routers. The point of a routing protocol is to share routes with other routers. It does no good to run OSPF on only one router. You need to configure OSPF on Router 1 like you did on Router 0. If you include all the routes connected to Router 1 in the OSPF configuration for Router 1, Router 0 should be able to see them, and Router 1 should be able to see the routes on Router 0. 

Because the AS-PATH attribute is not updated in iBGP, in order to prevent routing loops, an iBGP router will not advertise routes learned from an iBGP peer. BGP speakers within a single AS (iBGP) must be connected in a full mesh or use a mitigation to prevent traffic from being blackholed. Some BGP attributes cannot be sent from one AS to a different AS, and some BGP attributes only have meaning between different ASes. 

The problem is that you are redistributing the static routes into OSPF, where they get the OSPF AD. At that point, it is the OSPF cost that dictates the where the traffic gets routed. The OSPF cost to the ASBR is smaller than the accumulated costs across the MPLS cloud and point-to-point link. Look at what is listed in the routing table on one of the sites that doesn't work. You really need to be careful about removing the redistribution because it may be in place for something else. You could also change the route map to exclude redistribution of the static networks to Site A. You should investigate the redistribution because redistribution is an ugly solution, and you may be able to eliminate it altogether. 

You seem to be very confused. There is no "standard" network size. A router interface has the network size that you configure on it. You should choose a size that matches the network requirements. In this case, it seems that you configured the router with a 20-bit network mask, which will let you have 4094 host addresses on the network. The hosts on a network need to have their network masks set to be the same size as the network mask is configured, otherwise you can end up with problems. 

One of the methods for assigning IPv6 addresses is called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), which uses a modified EUI-64 for the Interface ID portion of the IPv6 address. Using the modified EUI-64 is a way the help ensure any self-generated address on a link is unique. Other methods for that have been used, too, since SLAAC was described in the RFC. An IPv6 address consists of the Global Routing Prefix assigned by the ISP or RIR, the Subnet ID assigned by the network administration, and the Interface ID. RFC 4291, IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, Section 2.5.4, Global Unicast Addresses, describes this: 

You need to understand the the layer-3 switches are really layer-2 switches with a virtual router inside. Traffic that comes into a layer-2 ports will still use layer-2 first when traffic is on the same VLAN. That means any ping from VLAN 10 to any address on VLAN 10 will travel via VLAN 10 to the pinged address. The same for VLAN 20. When you ping from VLAN 10 to VLAN 20, your gateway, one of the SVIs on one of the switches, it will place the packet onto VLAN 20, where it will be switched at layer-2. The way to connect the routers with routing would be to use layer-3 interfaces. You use the command on an interface, and configure that interface like a router interface. Each layer-3 switch would have its own separate set of VLANs, and it doesn't matter if they are the same numbers, they will be separate VLANs. The switches will only be connected via layer-3 interfaces, instead of the layer-2 interface you currently use. Just think of it like the layer-3 switches are layer-2 switches with external routers connected to them by the SVIs. That is basically how they work. 

MAC addresses are addresses for some (IEEE LAN) layer-2 protocols. Other layer-2 protocols use other addressing, or no addressing at all. If you are using frame relay on your serial port, then you are using a DLCI (Data Link Connection Identifier) instead of a MAC address. Something like PPP only has two possible endpoints, so any frame sent will be received by the intended receiver, hence PPP doesn't really have addressing. HDLC is proprietary to each vendor, but more than likely, there is no real addressing. These are common layer-2 protocols used on serial interfaces. Of the IEEE LAN protocols, some use 48-bit MAC addresses, and some use 64-bit MAC addresses. Routers strip off the layer-2 frame, which may contain the MAC addressing, depending on the protocol used. The router will then route the layer-3 packet based on the layer-3 address, and it will build a new layer-2 frame for the layer-2 protocol on the interface used to forward the packet. It is common that the local LAN will use MAC addresses, and the WAN will not. The router will strip off the LAN frame, and it will create a frame for the outbound protocol that does not use MAC addressing.
