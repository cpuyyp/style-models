I'd update the PHP script with something equivalent. My guess is your PHP version and environment is not the same as it was on your old server. 

But really you should use an XML parser for reasons that should be (or will become) all too obvious. 

If so, I'd expect to see NTP comment on this in syslog - this will tell you exactly when the problem occurs. Perhaps this coincides with a cron job or some external event. I'd follow up such clues. I'm assuming you'd notice if a hardware fault was freezing the system for 5 minutes at a time. 

If you can't fix the problems when running the unsupported and obsolete MSJVM under Windows 7, the only way to run the application is to do so under an older Windows operating system, perhaps in a Virtual-PC under Windows-7. Microsoft have a MSJVM transition guide which includes a MSJVM Diagnostic tool and tools to translate J++ to C#. I don't think you can easily overcome the fundamental issue that Microsoft dropped support for MSJVM. 

Not if you use TCP or UDP transport-layer protocols or any of the application-level protocols built on them. Such as HTTP In some operating systems there is a single process as part of the OS, but it hands off connections to specific applications. 

In other words, I'd automate this using a shell script and ssh rather than trying to find rsync options for managing your webserver. 

You are aware that Microsoft no longer support XP and no longer provide security updates for this in the normal way? It is no longer safe to connect an XP system to the Internet. 

Update: You are using lib_curl from PHP, but in a way I don't recognise. Other PHP examples of curl use functions like and I suspect you need to dump out what you are sending (the post data), compare PHP versions and amend the code to check for error responses. I don't know how you'd do that with the library you are using, with other PHP curl libs you do something like this: 

Note that the tar file now contains both old and new versions of b.txt OK so on to the nub of your query 

I'm not persuaded that random data is any more effective than a single pass of zeroes (or any other byte value) at obscuring prior contents. To securely decommission a drive, I use a big magnet and a large hammer. 

vi should read configuration commands in a file, if it exists, in your home directory. This should be documented in but you can check OReilly 

The wordcount command tells us how many lines, words and characters are in each file. So 121 lines (880 words, 4603 bytes) of ASCII text were encoded as 1 line of hex digits. 

There's nothing in the manual to suggest the RC-300 supports RS-485 Other vendor's product descriptions generally do say if they support RS-485. RS-485 is a more specialised comms standard than RS-232, mainly used in industrial systems 

It is sometimes called Port Address Translation (PAT) or Network and Port Translation (NAPT) It isn't mentioned in DD-WRT documentation for Port Forwarding However it does discuss "Port Mapping" 

In the case where the other end is outside your local network, your PC doesn't need to know the subnetting arrangements at the other end it just needs to know enough to deliver the packets to the nearest router. For that it uses two pieces of info. 

In a comment Bob provided a link to UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then?. I recommend you read that carefully, although lengthy, it is well written and clear. 

For logging (rather than monitoring) you should consider using the Linux audit daemon introduced in kernel 2.6. 

it's tradition. by inspecting the pixel values or superimposing the image over a background or by zooming in and observing that the chequerboard spacing is unaffected. 

In the absence of specific data about your use of your specific system, the optimal partitioning scheme to adopt would be a single partition. To get best performance make the partition at the outer edge of the disk, make it no larger than needed for the files and leave the rest of the disk unused. If you make multiple partitions you run the risk of decreasing performance as the disk is forced to make head movements between groups of files at the start of each partition and to maintain multiple filesystem metadata. In theory you can optimise the placement of frequently accessed files, but partitioning is an extremely crude way to achieve this and if done without careful gathering of statistics is likely to fail to achieve a benefit. For example, on my PC I suspect the most used files are the registry and in Chrome's cache-directory. I think constructing a partitioning scheme around that might be difficult, the most used files may be scattered in disparate folders. 

There is clearly some resource on BJPA which the laptops use at weekends. If you haven't done a cold boot since the weekend (e.g. suspend or hibernate only), the laptop might still think it needs access to that resource. If you have done a cold boot since the weekend then it could be a "persistent" mapping of some sort. Do you ever use a printer connected to BJPA? What does in a command-prompt window tell you? 

Note: Change to if you want perl to make a backup of the file before the changes. You can also do it this way (using simple text equality test, no regex). 

Many Apple keyboards have far fewer keys. Microsoft's influence seems to be to increase the number of keys on keyboards (and of functions on mice). 

You should probably take all the disks offline, make backups of the disks (e.g. disk images transferred to new disks) and work on copies of the disks, keeping the old disks locked away and out of use. 

So far as I know, there is no special code to control displayed "pages" because "next page" has different meaning on an iPhone, on a 10" tablet and on a dual 24" screen PC. I believe can be used in CSS2 to affect printing of HTML. 

If the SD card is (for example) sdb, don't ask dd to read sdb, you could ask it to copy just the partitions by specifying (for example) sdb1 or sdb2. You'll have to partition the target device with equal sized partitions first and specify those as the targets. Unix/GNU-Linux systems have a variety of tools for copying data 

There's an old but informative article that describes some of the input methods. I'm not actually familiar with Japanese IMEs but they may be similar to Chionese ones which fall into several types 

So far as I know, The PDF specifications don't define "scanned PDF" or "OCR". Some PDF authoring tools presumably make clever use of PDF features when they are creating PDF files from scanned images and when invisibly including text that they created using OCR. This allows text searches and cut&paste operations to be performed on the PDF produced - which would not be possible if only the bitmap image were present. Such PDFs may be useful, but they are really a bit of an abomination. It is always better to produce a PDF from a non-scanned sources where available. PDF was originally intended to be a "final" document format. Not one intended to have further manipulations performed on it. However it must be possible that other programs supporting PDF manipulation do so without forcing the conversion to be done through a printing API. In which case they can do it in a way that produces a result that better suits the quirks of Acrobat and other PDF-reading software. 

I don't know Russian but pasting that into translate.google.com suggests that the above is plausible: 

If you borrow Unix utilities (e.g. by installing any of Cygwin, GnuWin32, unxutils etc) then you can probably achieve that with a combination of and 

This seems a foolhardy thing to do. Better to buy a higher capacity battery (if available) than a lower-power PSU. 

There are other virtualisation systems that allow you to run one operating system within another. Here are some instructions for running 7 inside Vista using VirtualBox, this would allow you to use Windows-7 as a guest inside Vista with access to your printer and Apple TV. Apparently, you can also run Vista inside 7 (by swapping 7 for Vista in the instructions) but then you wouldn't have drivers for your devices. 

RHEL/Fedora/centOS/Ubuntu As you know, RHEL is available by paying an annual subscription and targeted at large corporate businesses. Many people who want to learn about RHEL at home use CentOS instead. If you are new to Linux I suggest you consider using something like Ubuntu. 

Apart from the proxy method suggested by Journeyman Geek, another way to test is to have two separate Internet connections in your home or office. I have two separate ADSL connections but a cheaper way of performing the occasional test is to tether an Android (or equivalent) mobile phone to your laptop and use it's (3G or other) data connection as an independent Internet access path. 

E-book readers are relatively inexpensive. Check prices for basic Kobo ($67?), basic Kindle and similar devices. As you know, the battery on these can last weeks or even months of typical usage. Decompressing and playing video is inherently a power-consuming activity. 

Following Gilles comment I found Web Sequence Diagrams which follows the traditions of Graphviz but does it online. You enter some text 

You might be able speed it up by persuading grep that the world is ASCII once again, either by using an ancient grep or by playing with locales (LC_ALL=C?). This conversation mentions "massive slow-downs on UTF8 locales" but doesn't help. 

However since ..( is a valid folder name which can be opened in explorer, there's probably more to the name than you've seen. The technique may still be useful. 

This combination makes it near impossible to thread such messages. There are Thunderbird bug-reports that discuss how to deal with this (maybe this specific problem is resolved now?) It is possible that other mail clients exist that do not produce these headers in a useful form. What are these headers? RFC822 says 

Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) block port 80 traffic (in that direction only obviously) to prevent their domestic/residential customers running web-servers that would cause the ISP traffic volumes the ISP don't wish to support. Check with your ISP. 

wget may be using a proxy setting whilst curl isn't - check your environment variables (http_proxy?) and startup files. you can test this with 

No. A useful point is that the first defined site is the one that is served if the client request is for a site domain name or address not in the Apache configuration explicitly. 

socat supports forking and has other features that may be useful in achieving multiple concurrent connections. The above example assumes you have some client application which works with a serial connection, the client instance of socat provides the local end of a relay for a local virtual serial port to a remote real serial port. If you have an application that doesn't expect a local serial port but which communicates over TCP direcly, you wouldn't need the local instance of socat. For multiple serial ports you could start multiple instances of socat, each of which can handle multiple consecutive connections. 

Some routers provide a means to appoint one computer on your LAN to receive all incoming connections initiated from the outside. This is referred to using a number of terms and phrases such as "True DMZ†" or just "DMZ - although I don't recall "Virtual server" being one of them. The term "virtual server" usually means something completely unrelated - the means of hosting one or more guest operating systems concurrently on the same single computer - usually with a host operating system but somethimes with a bare metal hypervisor. Port forwarding allows you to direct incoming traffic to many different servers on your LAN, depending on the connection's destination port number. For example port 30122 might be forwarded to port 22 on server A, port 30222 might be forwarded to port 22 on server B. It seems to me the manual for the D-Link DIR-655 uses the term "virtual server" for port-forwarding where the internal and external port numbers are the same. It uses "port forwarding" for port-forwarding where the external and internal port-numbers differ. So far as I know, this use of the term "virtual server" for port-forwarding isn't used generally and is likely to cause confusion with virtual servers in the context of virtualisation. 

Unless your router supports "hairpin" routing, you can't test port forwarding from inside your own network, you need to use an independent Internet connection. 

Use one computer as a port-translating relay. Configure the router to forward all required ports (unchanged) to that computer. Use something like socat to bounce the connection over to a different port on the other computer as needed. example 

Perhaps, because your resolver finds a wildcard "A" record. You could update your question with details of where you typed the ping command (e.g. from a Command-Prompt on a Windows-7 desktop PC). A cut&paste of what is returned by might be helpful. 

No, TCP connections work the same way for local or remote (routed) servers. The three-way handshake is the same. You can check 

Perhaps you should change the + to * in case processLoad occurs at the start of a line. If processLoad(...) can occur in the middle of a line you'd need a rather different expression. 

A physical LAN is comprised mostly of switches and cables arranged (in the case of Ethernet) into a single tree structure. Normally a LAN is a single subnet. An organisation might have several LANs linked by routers. A single physical LAN can be split into several logical LANs (VLANs) using VLAN support in the switches. Each VLAN then has a separate subnet. A router is therefore needed to move packets between the logical LANs (VLANs). 

It seems you can use ImageMagick to convert from RGB to CMYK if you use the appropriate color profiles For example if the source image contains a color profile 

UK SOHO Broadband Home broadband is typically provided through a router that uses network address translation (NAT) where the internal network uses a private address range (e.g. 192.168.1.) and the external "public" address is dynamically allocated by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). Because it is dynamically allocated, it can change from time to time. Usually, when your home computers are turned on they broadcast a DHCP request asking for an internal IP-address they can use. Usually your router responds and allocates an address from a pool of internal addresses. The internal addresses typically can't be reached directly but your router uses NAT to translate between internal and external addresses. Static IP-address You need to ask for a "static IP-address". This means iyour public IP address will be fixed and can be published for use with your teapot. You won't get to choose the actual address. Some UK ISPs charge an extra monthly fee for this (e.g. BT) but some do not (e.g. Zen). Teapot Internal Address Your Teapot might have a configurable fixed IP-address, in which case you should configure an address within the internal network range used by your router but outside the range handed out by your router - it's DHCP range. Alternatively you can configure your router to always give the teapot the same internal address. Port Forwarding Incoming requests to your router, for teapot service, need to be passed on to the specific internal address of your teapot. You do this using "port forwarding". Some routers may refer to this as "pinholes" or use some other terminalogy. 

That matches a single character, the character matched can be any one of the four specified. Inside the metacharacter is just treated like an ordinary character (because that is the most useful way for it to be treated in that context). The brackets are for specifying one character to be found in the text that can have several possibilities. For example, if you want to match either of the words or you could use which means match a character that is either or followed by a second character that is followed by a third character that is followed by a fourth character that is . You could match and using but the matches any single character so the RE would also match and other words you might not want. provides a means for you to be more specific than in specifying the values of a single character in the text which you want to match 

Since CPUs must always be doing something, the "System Idle" process is the CPU twiddling it's thumbs when it has nothing to do. The list of processes in Task Manager represent a significant amount of other activity. Windows and third-party drivers are perpetually busy with petty housekeeping, monitoring, broadcasting and a hundred other things. To find out more you can look at network traffic with something like wireshark and look at disk activity with SysInternals utilities. 

This sort of experience does demonstrate the importance of making a daily backup of important data to an external hard disk or to another computer. It is probably worthwhile making occasional copies onto DVD and storing those in a separate building (in case of fire or burglary). 

Update: Part of the difficulty is that, as I'm sure you know, IMAP is designed so that all the mail is kept in one place and you access that service online from a variety of clients - all presenting the same view. A POP service expects you to download all your mail to a single local client (and delete it from the POP server). What you are trying to do is neither one nor the other. Fetchmail attempts to deal with this by only downloading messages marked as unread. If you mark some messages as read by accessing the IMAP server with a client, the server won't present those messages to fetchmail when it asks for unread messages. You want a local mirror of your IMAP mailbox regardless of message status. I don't know how to use fetchmail to achieve that.
