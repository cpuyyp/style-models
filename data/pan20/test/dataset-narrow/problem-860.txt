It is not supported as such. However, you can use command to create new drive letter out of folder. If you do on root folder, that would give you desired results. E.g. 

Is there some command line function within FreeNAS (FreeBSD) derivative which could return my external address? Since that same address is synchronized with DynDns (via router), in C# I retrieved that via DNS query like this: 

As far as I know, there are no provisioning in answer file to do it. Answer file contains only settings that you get asked during setup. Page file is not one of them. 

You can try using VHD attach. It has option to attach VHD after each boot. Since one part runs as service, no UAC prompt will bother you. 

You will not be able to cache Windows Updates in that manner. For cacheing them, check Microsoft's WSUS. 

I know this is an old question, but it is the first question that shows up when searching "commvault" on serverfault. I have two years of experience with Commvault Simpana v9 and v10 as a support technician and a year as a systems engineer. First Question 

Perform the partial restore of all remaining filegroups one by one to restore the entire database. IMPORTANT NOTE: This cannot be done in parallel and must be done sequentially! 

This will start an immediate restore of the database back to the system from which it was backed up from and the data will be overwritten. Database Restore (Out-Of-Place) A database can be restored to another system that also has the SQL Database Backup Agent installed. This restore mounts the database in an online state on the destination system once the data has been restored. 

P.S. I know that 89.172.197.320 is not real IP address. I wrote it like that in order not to share mine IP address (or IP address from someone else). P.P.S. Thanks for help to Kronick and Avery Payne since their ideas pushed me in right direction. 

You may wish to enable offline files for that network location. This will not prevent disconnects but it will give you offline copy to work with even if connection is lost in middle of editing. Once connection is restored, file will be copied back to server and synchronized. Only issue here may be if another user modified that file while connection was down since that would cause synchronize error and you would need to resolve it automatically. 

1) no 2) yes 3) maybe For home server, I would go with desktop motherboard since it is much cheaper. 64-bit drivers were problem for quite a while since desktop motherboard manufacturers didn't bother much. However, if you search for little bit better desktop motherboard with Intel chipset, you cannot go wrong. 

I have a normal Apache/MySQL serving a webapp that companies and users of those companies log in to. So everyone from all the companies are in the same Users table. Whilst my code does try to keep the companies isolated in PHP, such as , I do see the chances of an SQL injection to get private data from other customers as being quite likely as the code base is quite vast. We are reviewing the code, but at this rate we will be completed in years. In the meantime, I was looking at Docker to hopefully give each of my customers their own container with Apache server (with a tiny buffer, and 2 php workers), and MySQL with a measly 32 or 64 MB of buffer pool. This container would then allow just 1 TCP connection for HTTPS, which would be reverse-proxied based on hostname (eg customer-a.mycompany.com). No files get written to disk. And the PHP source code would be kept up-to-date using git, so perhaps we could even put selected customers on our Beta version, for example. I have been advised that Docker is not designed for the above scenario, and would not provide me with the security I seek. I get that a hacker could inject code into 1 container and would affect that one customer. But would Docker not prevent discovery of the virtual hosts used for other customers, reducing the chances slightly that a hacker would have affect on most of my customers. Just one we could financially handle, but not 12. Aside from security, I was excited about the possibility of the MySQL buffer pool being dedicated to each company was going to make the webapp generally faster because when Customer A does an insane SQL report, I am guessing the buffer pool gets overwritten with the insane report, so when Customer B does a simple query next, the data has to be fetched from disk all over again. In the future, I would love to see these "containers" on a GUI, and be able to drag-and-drop them onto another server (faster, with less containers).. eg to offer "faster" speeds to certain power customers. Does any of the above dreaming fit into reality for 2017? What platform/tool do you think I should consider? 

You can try DynDns. It will enable you to connect your dynamic IP with your DNS address (given to you by DynDns). It only requires small utility on your side at worst. If you have access to router, it gets even easier since almost all routers have support for it. 

NTLDR error can arise for many different things, but fragmentation is not one of them. In this case I would go with "disk failing" reason since, as you noticed, even TrueImage couldn't read it. Since TrueImage reads everything sector-by-sector, it would not mind fragmentation. Try to backup everything you can since I assume that drive will completely fail very soon. Fragmentation will have effect here since it is much harder to recover data from fragmented drive than from non-fragmented one, but it is definitely not the cause. 

From the CommCell Browser, navigate to Client Computers | Client | SQL Server. Right-click the Instance and then click All Tasks | Browse and Restore. Click View Content. In the right pane of the Browse window, select a non-system database you want to restore and click Recover All Selected. Select the Destination Server from the drop down. Rename the database under the Database column and change the path of the database and log files under the Physical Path column. Select Unconditionally overwrite existing database or files checkbox. Click OK to start the restore. 

This will start an immediate restore of the database(s) to the destination system selected and mount the database in an online state. Restore Database using File or FileGroup Level (Out-Of-Place) You can restore a database in its entirety by restoring all the files/filegroups that make up the database. This option does not allow for multiple database selection, however this is to your advantage as File Level restores of Databases are usually limited to a single stream per job. Using multiple Database File Restore jobs you can increase your overall restore throughput and reduce the time needed to restore the entire dataset. Note: If you're restoring a single large database to files it is preferable to break out the individual database files as separate jobs using Performing Partial (Piecemeal) Restore of a Database (Out-Of-Place) 

Try to install it in Windows Vista compatibility mode (right-click on installer and go on compatibility tab). Since this program does support Vista, I would expect that to work. Only installer is broken. 

I would assume that this is issue with drivers. However, IDE has same size limit as SCSI on Hyper-V. Usually IDE disks are a LOT easier to use in Linux and that solves problems with visibility in most cases. In your case that is a problem since you use first Hyper-V Server 2008 release. If you can, I would recommend moving to Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 which will allow you to have big disk on IDE interface and thus avoid any driver issues with Linux and SCSI. P.S. You can just disconnect already existing VHD and re-attach it as IDE since format is not dependent on interface. 

To answer your direct question: Nothing would break if you don't configure SRV record on public domain. In fact, I don't even do it because even though the docs claim Outlook 2007 supports this, in my experience it plain doesn't. Only Outlook 2010 does. It's just Yet another strategy to get users to pay for the latest product. What I do, is this: 

Add an A record for "autodiscover.domain.com" to your Exchange box public IP. Obtain and install an SSL certifcate for CN or SAN for autodiscover.domain.com. Ensure $URL$ shows some xml after logging in, and pressing F5 shows a new time stamp each time you refresh the page. Check the URLs for autodiscover using these Exchange Shall commandlets:- Get-OABVirtualDirectory Get-ClientAccessServer Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory Get-PowerShellVirtualDirectory Get-ECPVirtualDirectory Get-OWAVirtualDirectory Get-ActiveSyncVirtualDirectory Get-AutodiscoverVirtualDirectory 

How can I trick SBS 2011 into allowing me to assign a UPN alias so users can logon as user@domain.com See $URL$ But on SBS I only have a 'General', 'Trusts', and 'Managed by' tab.. this is SBS 2011. 

There are a two ways that CommVault Simpana v9,v10, and v11 restore Microsoft SQL databases, Database Level Restore and Database File/FileGroup Level Restore. Each has variations depending on the desired outcome. See below for details: v10 Microsoft SQL Database Restore Documentation v11 Microsoft SQL Database Restore Documentation Here are some directions that apply to v9, v10, and v11. Default Database Restore (In-Place) By default, a database is restored in the same location from where it was backed up using the CommVault Simpana SQL backup agent and the existing database files are overwritten. This restore leaves the database in an online state. 

If available, an alternative would be to stand up the database in a virtual recovery environment in New Hampshire where the backup data is being stored and route Austin traffic appropriately to the recovered SQL system. This would be much faster to achieve you Recovery Time Objective, however only feasible if you can route traffic appropriately.
