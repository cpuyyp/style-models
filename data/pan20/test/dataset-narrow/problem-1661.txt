I ran all these commands from both ddrossi93@raspberrypi and root@raspberrypi, neither have changed a thing. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance. I figured it out. See Answer. 

I hope this helps someone in the future so they don't have to go through hours of trying to figure it out. Thanks to Joe Platano for giving suggestions. 

My torrents seemed to be running okay, but when I tried the IpMagnet tool nothing comes up and I don't know if this is good or bad. Any insight/help would be appreciated! Thanks! **EDIT:**I talked to PIA's support and they basically said there's no real support yet for Raspbian. So to make it easier on myself I switched to Ubuntu Mate, downloaded the PIA app and it worked perfectly. For anyone else trying to do the same, I recommend switching to Ubuntu mate as well. Sorry there isn't a real answer here. The troubleshooting guide below is an awesome help though! 

Is it possible to update my version of EmulationStation on my Pi without uninstalling everything and installing a later version? I'm using RetroPie v1.1 and I've installed a v2.3 (I think) on a previous Rasp Pi and it must of had a newer version of EmulationStation as the one that came with RetroPie v1.1 doesn't look too nice and has less features etc.. So basically I'm wondering if I can upgrade EmulationStation (fairly easily) from the Pi's command or do I need to start from scratch? 

After doing what I listed in the description, I then found an option in the settings of the WD myCloud NAS to turn on NFS access. Once this was enabled, it mounted without any errors or issues. 

after much research I found my answer. I unmounted what I had and started from scratch. I then remounted using this line in the terminal logged in as the user ddrossi93: 

I recently purchased a VPN (PIA) and set it up on my Pi 3 using openVPN and I am not sure if it is working or not. When I do an ifconfig, I do get a tun0 interface, but when I open a browser and try to connect to a webpage, I get this error: 

I've hooked up an LDR to a pi's GPIO and ground pin directly. I set up the internal pull-up resistor on the broadcom chip. This created essentially a voltage divider, that would make the pin would read low if a led shined on it, and high is not. Since you only need a yes/no answer there is no need to measure the time to charge a cap, just like analog-to-digital converters do. You just need the voltage to be either above or below the tripping point of the GPIO for either state of the led. The tripping point for the gpio seems to be around 1.2v ($URL$ So under normal lighting condition the voltage should be above 1.2v. When the led is shining on the LDR, the voltage should be above 1.2v. Just note that in my setup I've taped the LDR to the led with black tape, so the LDR is in complete darkness. You probably have to have some external pull-up resister that better matches the resistance of the LDR. Some variable resistor (pot) would be a cheap and handy way to calibrate. My sample test script for reading the gpio pin. 

I've bought a wifi adapter for raspberry pi, I don't have an OS, I'm running RetroPie so I need a console solution. Someone suggested accessing: 

I have a formatted 8gb sd card (7.1gb available) and I've tried multiple times to install the roughly 4gb in size RetroPie disk image. Each time I do, it says I have 55.9mb left and says it becomes FAT format when I previously formatted it to NTFS. Has anyone else had this problem? 

I've installed RetroPie and I've tried update it to its latest version (I think). RetroPie runs fine and games load perfectly but the problem I'm having is getting a USB controller to work. I've tried following all the examples but I always get stuck at the same point... Each tutorials at some point tell me to access - the problem is that an folder doesn't exist in my retropie SFTP, I've tried searching for a solution and a few websites suggested to update my RetroPie which I think I've done correctly and even noticed it say in the command lines a handful of times as it was updating and assumed it would be added. But nothing, after restarting RetroPie there was still no emulator folder to access these files that people were telling me to update.. I've been trying for ages with no results, does anyone know how to get this folder to appear? Just to add... I have sufficient space on my sd card too. 

You shouldn't power the led strip from the Pi's 5V line. Only connect the GND, CI and DI lines to the Pi. Connect the 5V and GND of the led strip to the separate power adapter. Note that the ground is "interconnected" here. If the adapter isn't strong enough for the entire length, you can indeed split the led strip into sections. Just like above, connect DO to DI, CO to CI and GND to GND. Next connect the new adapter to the 5V and GND of the new section. 

I just mounted my Apple Time Capsule to my pi, but for some reason I cannot change, add, or remove any content from the directory. I have tried changing permissions from my username and from root but am having no luck, nothing changes. the directory is /home/ddrossi93/TimeCapsule and the Owner and Group are both set to ddrossi93 (I have a group named this as well). Permissions are anyone can view and access, but only the owner can change content. I am 99% sure I am logged in as ddrossi93, the owner. The folder within the directory (/home/ddrossi93/TimeCapsule/Downloads) has a different owner and group. the owner and group are both root. Anyone can view and access, but only the owner can change content. I have tried the following lines in terminal, but nothing has changed. 

At $32,- I'd just try, and see if it works. Camera's that are designed for those kinds of conditions will probably cost into the hundreds if not thousands of dollars. You could try putting the board into an enclosure, and force cool outside air though it with some tubing and a fan of sorts. Also be aware of air-humidity. 

Some hub backfeed power to the Pi. Either buy a hub that is verified to work, or open the usb cable and snip the 5V line, preventing backfeed. Make sure you have 2 usb cabled between the hub and the Pi as illustrated below. One for power from the hub to the Pi. One for data from the pi to the hub. 

Apart from overclocking my Pi (already done), is it possible to speed up and emulated game as some ROMs that I play, (specifically Final Fantasy 6 for the SNES) as the music in the game drops at the end of each note and sounds off so it's quite annoying to play. I've tested the same ROM file on my laptop and the sound issue doesn't happen so I know it's not a problem with the ROM itself. Most games run just fine but I was wondering if there were any more little tips to help speed up the ROMs? 

Your current situation could indeed create a short between two row pins. (the keyboard might have some resistors inside, but I think that is unlikely). A software only solution might be to set the GPIO pins back to inputs, when you don't use them, instead of setting them to 3.3 volt. The diode solution will also work. The GPIO pins need at least around 2.6V to register a HIGH. So 0.6V is no problem. Resistors will also work. Note that you calculate the voltage incorrectly on the voltage divider. Since the internal pull-up is something like 10kOhm, the resulting voltage will be more like 0.2V. Downside to the resistor solution is that if you press multiple button in the same column, none will register.
