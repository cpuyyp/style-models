I found out the there is a really good way to do this. Outlook 365 has in the web portal version of office a "sweep" rule that can run periodically through the inbox cleaning up email. The useful option I found was to delete all email older than days from a particular recipient.  I was able to clean up my inbox without having outlook running on my desktop in a matter of hours. How to set up a server side Sweep rule for outlook 365 

If your outlook inbox is hosted on Outlook 365, you can set up a sweep rule and let the server clean up the mess in the background while your outlook is closed. I cleaned up an email mess of 100,000 emails by deleting emails from a particular sender older than 10 days old in about 3 hours How to set up a sweep rule on outlook 365 

Keep reading stories about how ipv4 is just about out of addresses and how we need to start moving to ipv6 What kind of hardware is out there and what features desirable for SMB and or home use? 

you might also want to look at MSIZAP and how to recover space from orhpaned installs and hotfixes you are never going to remove : MSIZAP and orphaned cached windows installer data files. Can clean up these funny files and if your system is old enough a ton of disk space. on an older XP machine I got back 40GB one time. the short of it is to get MSIZAP.exe from Microsoft.com and run it with MSIZAP G! and its done. 

In my version of Vim, after using that sequence, the last visual area is slightly wonky (re-selecting it with selects an area that is not quite right). To move around in the current visual area a user can use (and maybe if using a block area) interactively, but these are not deterministic if you want to use them in a map. So, I wrote the function below to make a deterministic version of (defined as and below). The example command uses them to do a similar ‘wrapping’ as the above , but also fakes keeping the visual area selected by re-selecting an area () after doing the wrapping: 

Before a new feature is ever merged into master, it is reviewed on the mailing list and “cooked” (often for several weeks) in the pu and next branches that the developers regularly test and use. Git’s version numbers work like this: 

This will certainly run your twice (once before screen, once for each shell created inside screen). Depending on how you do your PATH manipulations, this may lead to multiple copies of the same additions to your PATH (this is generally not a problem). 

Note: is only really necessary if a variable with the same name exists. If you do not also have a variable named , then will delete the function. 

I would use a spare external enclosure, or an inexpensive universal drive adapter (SATA/PATA 2.5”/3.5” to USB) to connect the new drive and make a regular bootable “backup” to it before swapping them. I have heard that Time Machine can do full system restores, but a regular backup utility (e.g. SuperDuper!, Carbon Copy Cloner, etc.) seems like a better match to the job. 

I have taken over from a colleague the monitoring of a large inbox hosted on outlook 365. the inbox has accumulated about 100,000 emails. mostly the messages are from two monitoring accounts that report system up / system down sort of activity in an email. I tried the following to no avail: 1) create rule to delete all messages from a particular address. the rule would take about 16 days to complete running inside outlook 2016 2) I sorted the inbox by the "From" and tried to delete the group of about 50,000 emails. outlook hummed along and reported that it would take about 8 minutes to process. it ran without incident, but at the end none of the emails were actually deleted out of the inbox. any help or tips on how I might slay this demon? 

Is there a win hotkey combination to start your browser? I know that win + E will start windows explorer, but I have found nothing to start the browser in windows 7? If there isn't such a key is there a utility that could be installed to set up the combination like Win+B? 

I have run SFC /SCANNOW on my Vista notebook. SFC identified server files that it said were also damaged in the backup location. The log in \windows\logs\cbs\cbs.log identifies all the problem files - where do I get the replacement files given all the service packs, hotfixes and automatic updates applied to my machine ? is there a definative source for these items? 

If you only have a couple of labels that you use, you might save a couple of copies of this and bind a key to each copy. Here is a version that always prompts you for which label to apply: 

It seems to me that one might describe what you want as a “stream editor” for tar files that allows you to apply the pathname translation. The idea is to take a tar file as input and write a modified tar file as output. None of the tar﻿s who's documentation I checked (GNU tar, star, bsdtar) seem to support your exact operation. bsdtar is interesting though. Its syntax seems like it would come close to letting you read a tarfile and write a modified one, but the manpage entry for says that it only works in and modes). If it did work in mode, you could use something like this: 

The confusion probably comes from the fact that while is ostensibly just for setting session options, it will also accept window option names (i.e. for convenience you can omit the that would otherwise be required when setting a window option). If you care to document this distinction you might want to use (or ) when adjusting window options. 

When you resize a terminal emulator’s window, it adjusts its pseudo terminal (“pty”) by making a TIOCSWINSZ (Terminal IO Control Set WINdow SiZe) ioctl system call. In turn, the kernel sends a SIGWINCH (WINdow CHange) signal to the foreground process group (e.g. the running instance of Vim) of that pty. Finally, the program(s) that received the SIGWINCH can use a TIOCGWINSZ (G for Get) ioctl to retrieve the new pty dimensions and redraw itself as appropriate. Due to the way the script program works, the programs running “inside” the script session are actually running on a different pty from the pty created by the terminal emulator. Consider this log:
