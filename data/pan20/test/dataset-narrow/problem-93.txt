I have an Alcatel Lucent OS6450 and a Cisco 1812 Router. I need to trunk two VLANS to the Switch. VLAN 210, 300. VLAN 210 should be native VLAN. They all should be trunked to Interface 1/1 and then there should be 3 Access ports for each VLAN. My Interface on the router is configured like this. 

I have found many articles, possible solutions to this topic, but no one seems to have the same problem as me. I am working on a Cisco 1812 Router with IOS 12.4. I have found some things like hairpinning and DNS doctoring but those methods doesn't sound the right one, because every solution targets on the problem that you can't access it over its domainname. We have 2 extern ip addresses x.x.x.100 and x.x.x.101 which get nated to the inside addresses i.i.i.100 and i.i.i.101. so x.x.x.100 -> i.i.i.100 and x.x.x.101 -> i.i.i.101 My Configuration: 

In the "conversation words". You turn on your Computer and the Computer detects that there is a cable connected to your NIC. Computer thinks "NICE! I'm connected to a network - is their a DHCP server online, so I know where I am??" Computer sends out DHCP request. Router/DHCP Server gets this request and says to the Computer: "Hey! You are and this is your Netmask, your default gateway and other Informations - Welcome to the network!" 

If I connect to port 1/3 with the IP of 10.0.110.11 on the Client and the Gateway 10.0.110.1 I can't even ping the gateway. I'm not very familiar with Alcatel CLI, using Cisco most of the time but we got the switch for free so ... 

is a fodler where I think the image is stored. But I need a tar file (for upgrading with gui). What should I do? Are isn't it possible to upgrade the one AP and i have to stay at 15.2 with this one. UPDATE1: 

it sounds a bit strange, but how can i find out the IP Address which i can connect to? The Switch works fine, but i need to do some changes. I have console access to it, but i want it, because it's more comfortable, to do over SSH. rsa & dsa keys are generated und ip ssh server enabled. Now I only need to know which IP address the Switch has. It is our only DELL Switch in the company. The others are Cisco. 

It was a broken ASA, I sent it back to the Factory and they got it repaired. The Putty Setting from JFL are working now, if anybody needs them. 

activated. I am able to go on the internet with the "inside" network. But I can't ping the Gateway 172.16.18.1. Also, i have a client on Interface 3 connected with the ip 172.16.18.168/24 with the gateway 172.16.18.1. This client is alsp not able to ping 172.16.18.1. In ASDM, I'm able to ping the Gateway from the servers interface. What am I missing? I read here that i have to configure for every VLAN I have, a NAT-Statement. Is this true? Because I need 10 VLANs. I can't figure out what I'm missing. When I do Packet tracer in ASDM no ACL seems to block it. PS: the two clients are directly connected to the ports. PS:PS: I am configuring 80% over ASDM and 20% over CLI (the way I learned in school). 

I want to access my 2960-X on my "server-network". I have configured a network 10.0.0.0/24 (VLAN60) on the Router, which is connected to the switch over a trunkport. Also VLAN 40, 80, 90 is configured on this trunk. VLAN1 (default VLAN on the switch) is 192.168.1.1. My play is that the switch will get the IP address 10.0.0.200. So I reach the switch without changing the IP of my server. I also want to reach him on every interface in the whole network. Is the solution that I have to make every Port a trunk Port, which carries VLAN1 and the VLAN(60 or 40 or 80 or 90) ? Which would be definitly not my plan. Same scenario as the Router, which is reachable through the Gateways configured for the networks. Do I have to connect the Management Port (left side) to one of the Ports on those network? 

If your servers don't need Internet and you will only connect from server to server a switch should be fine, if all your server are in the same subnet eg 192.168.1.0/24. 

I have 3 Aironet Access Points. 2 are running on Version 15.3(3)JBB1 and when I factory resetted and its actually running on Version 15.2(4)JB3a. I wanted to copy the Configuration of on of the AP to the resetted one. But they are not on the same software and I think, this is the reason why i don't work right. We don't have an active contract (I asked) with Cisco. Is it possible to get the Image from one AP to another? And which file is it? Here's the output of the flash: 

Today I configured 2 Interfaces on my ASA 5512-X. Connected two Notebooks with GE Network Cards and started transfering a 20GB File. The Maximum Speed was at 18MByte/s. Notebooks were directly connected and the cable were completely new CAT6 cables. I changed the Hardware Properties to 1000MBit on each Interface. Auto Duplex. Where is the bottleneck? I can provide every config if you need. But I don't know what you guys need for troubleshooting. 

I think you forgot to create NAT-Rules for the VLANS. So you translate your internal IP to your Public IP. This is on my Router configured: 

I didn't change any configuration. It also worked before. Anybody knows, what could lead to this error? 

In Interface FE2 are the Webserver which get natted. FE0 is my outgoing Interface to my Provider. And FE1 is my Internal Network where every client connects to. I have no problem to reach to Webserver in the DMZ from the Inside Interface with his i.i.i.100 - IP. But i can't access him with his external IP x.x.x.100. You can reach him when you are on the Outside of my network (like you try to connect with your phone). Funny thing is, i can ping his External IP but if i want to navigate in Firefox to this IP the connection will get refused. There isn't a problem with the DNS, because I want to reach him with his IP. If i navigate to his internal IP, no Problem. I need to fix this, because if you connect to an VPN you can't access it anymore, because the DNS from the VPN will connect you to the external IP. This was the first time a recognized this behavoir. BIG EDIT: I didn't configure this router, it was someone else which isn't reachable anymore. So I have to figure everything out which is done on this one. 

It is to prevent routing loops due to bad practice or configuration errors. Example: Jackweasel.COM is single-homed to some transit provider Victim.NET who has assigned them a private ASN, say 65000. Someone at Jackweasel.COM decides to initiate a peering session with Clueless.ORG who has a public ASN, and has agreed to peer with Jackweasel using the private ASN that Jackweasel has (it would surprise you how many people would not notice off that bat that they are setting up a peering session with someone who is using a private ASN and might also peer with someone else). Now Jackweasel announces routes learned from Clueles to Victim. Victim will now keep that full path in its route announcements to prevent a loop just like it does with regular BGP announcements using public ASNs. Basically it is a matter of "someone is multihomed with a private ASN so I now have to treat the path the same as I do with public ASNs to prevent routing loops in other networks". It also might break connectivity to the announced routes for everyone else on the planet using that same private ASN. You might also be surprised at how many people accept routes with their own ASN because their network is not fully meshed. They have a colo in Virginia and one in California and they are each announcing a different /24 using the same ASN so they allow announcements carrying their own ASN to be installed so the two colos can talk to each other. But it also helps protect the Jackweasel who did this because they now see THEIR own private ASN in route announcements from Clueless (and who knows how many other peers they might have set up that way) that they sent to Victim. 

All data bits flow at exactly the same speed down the wire (the speed of light in the medium of travel). So a bit of data travelling 1000 miles down a 10 meg circuit arrives at the other end at exactly the same time as a bit travelling down a 100Gig connection. The difference is the RATE at which the signal can transition state between 1 and 0. The faster you can transition the state of the signal, the faster you can send the next bit. So -- basically there is no such thing as "speed" because it all operates at the same speed (the speed of light), what differs is the RATE of data bits you can send. That is the "bandwidth". The faster I am able to flip the state of the signal from 1 to 0 and back again, the more data I can send in a given amount of time. Imagine two signalmen using old time semaphore flags. One signals quickly, one signals slowly. The actual light reaching your eye is arriving at the same speed in both cases but one can send a lot more data in a given time than the other. That signalman has more bandwidth and can send more data in a given period of time. The data doesn't travel faster, but that one can pack more data into a given slice of time. 

You can configure a Palo Alto Networks firewall to fail over to the other ISP. You need to set up two sets of NATs -- one for one ISP and one for the other -- or set two DMZs, one for one ISP and one for the other (or overlay two subnets on one interface). It will use both for inbound and will fail over to the second for outbound when one fails. You can start reading here. 

It will work. You will get more loss at the splice than if you were splicing like fiber but you can do it. You can even mix the fiber types in longer runs. Reference: Mixing of G655 and G652 Fibers in a Network 

I can't figure out why you are running two instances of OSPF on the the 2900's. This looks way more complicated than it needs to be. You can run OSPF in passive mode on the firewall and distribute a default route from the 2900's. You put a static route on the 2900's for your /24 pointed at your firewall outside IP. Since this is active/standby, if the firewall fails over, the IP address moves with the active firewall. There really is no need to announce anything from the firewall, it is just listening for a default. If you are announcing a default, there is really no need for HSRP either, that can go away. The firewall will just send the traffic to where it hears the default. It might well load balance to both 2900's, though. Seems you are making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be. There is only ONE firewall address in this configuration so a static route will work just fine. Even so, there is no need for more than one OSPF instance and the only thing you are using that for is to handle the case where a router dies. Then the firewall uses the remaining path where it hears the remaining default route. 

As long as you are fully meshed and the you can backhaul your own traffic arriving at one site but destined to the other, sure, it will work. So if your peering session drops with either ISP, your more specific will be withdrawn (you HOPE!) and the traffic will flow to the aggregate route on the other ISP and you can then backhaul the traffic to the other site. The most frustrating problem I see is network providers that advertise unreachable routes. Either through some screwup internally or whatever, they announce a route to their peers that they can not actually reach inside their network. There isn't much of a workaround for those cases. As for the F5 handing reply traffic back via the interface on which it was received, most load balancers can do that. I don't specifically know if the F5 will but I know Citrix Netscaler will and A10 will so it seems to be a rather standard feature. 

Brocade with their VDX line of ethernet switching gear uses it. But the thing to keep in mind is that different vendors implement TRILL in different ways and they don't necessarily interoperate. The standard is so loose that two vendor versions can claim to be standards compliant but be completely incompatible. 

The default gateway of each PC needs to be the same as the subnet router port IP in its network. So the subnet router port in the first network would have the address 10.0.0.1 and the PC would have 10.0.0.2 and the default gateway would point to 10.0.0.1. This tells the PC "when I have a packet that must go to a destination that is not on my own network, send it to 10.0.0.1, and that device will know what to do with it". The "default gateway" is really just a route to 0.0.0.0/0 which means "the rest of the IP address space that I don't have a more specific route for". In fact, you can eliminate the routes on the subnet routers, too, and just give them a default gateway to the central router. So instead of having a route to 20/8 and 30/8 on the subnet routers, you could just put a route to 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to 192.168.1.2 on the first router, 192.168.2.2 on the second one, and 192.168.3.2 on the third. The only router that needs to know explicitly how to reach any of the 10.x.x.x routes is the central router at the top of your diagram. All of the rest can just have default routes.
