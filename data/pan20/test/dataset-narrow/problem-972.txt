Your question leaves a lot of information out. For instance... "if I specify my download location"... what program are you talking about? ... each program behaves slightly differently. Some programs download the file to a local temporary directory and then move the file to the location specified... others simply download the file to the directory with some sort of funny name/extension... then rename it to the correct name when completed. In most cases, files will be written to the "system volume" which is where the OS was initially installed. If that is your SSD, then your stuff will be written there. You can expect the life of your SSD to be comparable to that of a regular spindle drive. Simply downloading files will not be the bulk of read/writes on your SSD... so I wouldn't even worry about which drive you are downloading to. 

... I guess I should put this as an answer... Verify your .iso file is valid. Truncated or corrupted .iso files can cause issues when attempting to mount them in the guest OS. 

The "game" probably has hard-coded paths to directories relative to the working directory. i.e. "../textures/blah" instead of "/usr/local/game/textures/blah" ... without the src... couldn't begin to test. 

1 word... DropBox The desktop application will keep your files in sync... and it also has versioning support... as well as being freeeeeeeeeee. 

Usually when you run into that, your target is invalid. i.e. abc doesn't exist. Yes, you can create symlinks to things that don't exist. 

I honestly don't believe this is a problem with firefox or chrome directly. I currently have 1220 tabs open in chrome, and 732 in firefox, and it has been this way for over a week without a restart. There can be issues on several different fronts, but tracking down which is the culprit can be very difficult. A few things to look at: 

Changing drive geometry cannot be done to an encrypted volume. If you stop & think about the situation for a moment... without knowing what is full of data and what isn't... how can you reliably re-size the volume? 

I believe you mean "NFS"... not NTFS. First, yes NFS is faster... but also has some drawbacks. It is much more difficult to securely manage NFS shares than using sshfs. Additionally, NFS has no encryption by-default which puts much less load on your CPU. You can tunnel NFS traffic through ssh and you'll still see performance improvements over sshfs. NFS is also implemented in the kernel-space, whereas sshfs is in user-space. (fuse) 

Short of contacting Intel and getting them to answer that question... we can only guess. More than likely, there is some sort of bug in the power-management system on that board. (might be fixable with BIOS update.) 

I know you didn't want to hear this... but sadly, this appears to be a bad driver issue (if you're lucky)... or a failing video-card (if you're not so lucky). With Windows 7, Microsoft has gone to great lengths to implement a lot more DirectX into their GUI which means it uses the native graphics drivers' methods to render a great deal more on the screen. If the driver doesn't properly implement transparency and alpha-channels correctly, you'll see screen-artifacts remaining behind when you close/minimize an application. This can be caused when Windows tells the driver to draw the nice transparent area (that you have pointed out)... and the rendering function errors... due to hardware or software problems. Windows silently eats the error, but instead of rendering a nice transparent area... it leaves whatever random graphic buffer data there... which usually resembles whatever was there previously. Disabling the "Aero" features in Windows 7 may make the problem less noticeable... but you would lose all the shiney-graphics windows 7 adds. 

Short answer: $URL$ & use dpkg-buildpackage to build a deb & then install the deb. For future note... it wouldn't hurt to look at their releases page for that kind of stuff. That being said... why the old version? why not use the latest 5.3.6? Why not use the ubuntu repository package (at version 5.3.3)? 

As your phone is making a connection to each accounts... so must your desktop client (outlook) Your phone isn't tying them together... it simply displays them on one screen. Yes, you can setup as many accounts in outlook as your phone does (probably more). Anything your phone can connect to... more than likely... outlook can as well. Also, As long as you're not using POP, you can also keep the read/unread status in-sync. 

Processing power on one machine should not be affected by network traffic on another machine. I suspect there is something more going on behind the scenes. Perhaps a virus? 

I don't think you'll be able to find NDIS driver support for ANY wifi adapter. There simply isn't a driver-stack built for DOS that supports the necessary bits for WIFI. Your best bet is to look towards a wired card and plugging that into an access-point in station mode. 

(make sure you in ubuntu or you won't have sufficient privileges to write to the root dir.) instead of trying to extract files to some directory like ... you should be able to extract them to a short dir like from there... you should be able to manipulate your files however you need... and/or put them where they should go. Just remember to clean-up your by removing the temporary directory. 

9-9-9-24-1t looks correct to me... perhaps the previous versions of the BIOS didn't support the 9-9-9-24 1t configuration... so it ran the sticks slower. According to the manufactures site... they're rated for CL9... so going faster than that is probably a bad idea (lower-number = faster) 

There is a lot more to booting an operating system than simply having a bunch of files on the disk. There's a reserved bunch of blocks at the start of the disk that contain some special boot instructions which tell the computer how to boot. If your old hard drive isn't dead yet... I would highly recommend you look at a tool like clonezilla or Symantec Ghost to clone your hard drive. It will correctly copy the special bits of the drive that are needed to boot, as well as resizing the volume to fill the entire disk. 

Of course, you'd want to put that in some sort of startup script so the rules are applied every time your router boots. Additionally, keep in mind that this will not affect traffic, as is deliberately designed to NOT allow traffic to be proxied (or intercepted/decrypted/etc by someone in the middle). If you wish to filter out traffic (to questionable sites), you can also throw into the mix. It is possible to proxy https traffic, but it's highly not-recommended. If you are really-wanting to implement that functionality, there's a good guide here. 

not really. However, you can use curl under cygwin on windows, or even use the native dos/windows clients to suit your needs. $URL$ 

sorts all the routes by the IP. Your "default gateway" is actually the interface with the lowest metric. Unfortunately, Windows with it's attempt at being intelligent will use interfaces with a higher metric if it believes (read that as "undocumented reasons") there is a problem with the gateway with the lower metric. In my experience... it is better to simply specify 1 default gateway, and add static routes for the things on the other interface if needed. You can leave the "gateway" blank on the virtual interface. 

It sounds less like an issue with the SSD... and more likely an issue with your ISP. I ran into similar issues and discovered it was an issue with the MTU my ISP had. I wrote a rant on the subject a while ago... but here's the general steps to diagnose/resolve: First... look at your current MTU setting: Open a command prompt with Administrative privledges and then run the command as follows: 

In short... yes. They can log everything you do. The more long answer is... it largely depends on the kind of "shared hosting" you're referring to. If you only have FTP access and no ssh access (not counting SFTP) then a simple flip through their ftp logs will tell who did what from what IP when. Most big-providers do log this stuff quite heavily due to the legal implications that may come back to them. (i.e. if some law-enforcement agency traces a child-molester's content back to a provider... the provider must be able to provide data on the customer who posted it there & when) If you reserve a "VPS" or virtual server instance, and your virtual instance is running a FTP server within it, then the logs are yours to store or not-store. That still wouldn't prevent the provider from logging ftp traffic... as FTP is done in clear-text. Now... the other side of this coin is... weather or not someone actually wants to track down whoever deleted/uploaded/modified that content, and what lengths they may go to within the confines of a warrant or the time/$$$ necessary to look, are big questions. If there is an active investigation in-place, and you're considering tampering with evidence, you really should know that even if you've done nothing wrong, tampering with evidence makes you appear guilty more than anything else. 

What this should do for you is add the route... only when that interface is up. It will still sit in the "persistent routes" ... but won't actually be added to the routing table until that interface is up... and it gets removed again when the interface goes down. 

In short, the VHD is an actual file that can be either where it is immediately created with the full size of your virtual hard drive, or where the file will grow as empty space is filled. The VHD file itself behaves similarly to a physical disk drive. If the guest OS writes data to sectors 100-120 (for example), the virtual hypervisor takes those instructions and instead of writing them to a physical disk... it writes data into the VHD file instead. 

There are a lot more configuration options you can use, but these are a pretty good start for most uses. After that, the next step is simply to configure iptables in your default router to and redirect traffic to your proxy. 

It's marked as hidden. You can view it if you do ... or . (ah = all hidden files, ad = all directories including hidden) Another quick shortcut to get there is: use 

From there you can have sub-domain records as you see fit. Online tools like "nwtools.com" can be useful to figure out what DNS records can be resolved. It would also be useful to know what sort of DNS server you are running (Bind 9? Microsoft DNS? etc..) 

Make sure it's executable () and then run to create all the appropriate symlinks in the correct places to start/stop correctly. 

as the "Type" of formatting. The down-side is that if you referenced the data in that cell, (using some sort of formula) it would still have the negative value. The other is to use a dedicated "formula" column as cybernetic.nomad suggested. 

the possibilities are endless... but honestly setting up your own cloud can be more work than doing without. After you take into consideration the amount of time it takes to build the framework, then build the images... etc. It's definitely not geared towards a small deployment of 2-3 servers. 

Honestly... this question has many answers... too many to enumerate here. Largely this depends on the type of file-system... and the OS reading it... and also what features of the file-system are enabled. Every file system has some sort of "database" as you described to translate a name/path to one or more locations on the disk. How this "database" works is what makes each file-system different. Some methods are better for some tasks than others. Some are more recoverable & redundant in the event of a failure... some are strictly geared towards speed and have almost no recovery in the event of a single failure. Depending on the OS, and the file-system type, the "database" can be partially or even completely loaded into RAM in order to help speed-up the process of locating the position on the disk. Some file-systems make use of linked-lists & b-trees or other types of ordered trees in order to quickly locate files. Journaling can also speed-up the read/write processes dramatically (given the right conditions). There are even file-systems (mostly proprietary) that truly ARE a database. The real question is... Why do you want to know... and what are you trying to accomplish? If you want more specific answers... give more specifics about what OS/platform/file-system you are talking about. 

You're behind a captive portal, and it is attempting to redirect you to a login page of some sort Your root-certificate store has become corrupted. This can be the result of a virus or simple data-corruption. 

COM addins are a big security hole... imho. Allowing non-admin users to be able to install ANY COM addin is potentially giving them any/all access to your machine. COM addins can potentially do anything to your computer... with or without excel running. For this very reason... non-administrator users cannot install COM addins. It's not simply giving them access to making changes to the registry. If you're unconcerned about security... why not make all users an administrator... if you are concerned about security... find another way. You can do this with a simple script to deploy this across the network as administrator without having to physically sit at the workstation... or disrupt the current user. Here's an example: First... download psexec on your admin workstation. This will allow you to start a process on a remote machine. Second... create a batch-file that will do the work for you. Save it to a network share that the workstations will have access to. Something similar to the following:
