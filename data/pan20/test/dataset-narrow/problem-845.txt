Remote Desktop Connection (RDP). You can connect to a machine using the TCP 3389, view the desktop and do whatever you like. Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Almost everything in a Windows system can be manage through the MMC. You can open it using the command and in the menu File select Add or remove Snapin. The snap-in are DLLS created by the sofware manufacturers to manage their products. Windows comes with lots of them, for manage Disks, Users, Services, in a domain controller the Users and Groups, in a CA the certificates. When you add a snap-in you select if you want to manage the local system or a remote system. This requieres the 135 TCP port. You can save a console and the file extension is . Windows comes with lots of presaved consoles like , , , all of them save on . Remote command prompt. You can run a remote command prompt like you do with SSH using Telnet. This is not installed by default on Windows but you can install the client and the server using the server manager. This requieres the por 23. As you know Telnet is insecure and not reccomend because everythin is in plaintext. You have a really good alternative from Microsoft called PSExec that let you runs commands or open a remote command prompt without prior installation of anything and in a safe manner. Powershell Powershell is the new command line of Microsoft. It has a lot of advantages over the traditional command line. It was dessinged to work with Objects insted of plain text and you can do really powerfull things, this is the approach of Microsoft to compete with the famous terminal on the unix systems. You really should learn about it. Well, a lot of Powershell commands (Cmdlets) let you work in remote Systems. 

Do it for your tests. That is a really intersting question. Teorically you cannot do this, you cannot install VMWare EsXI or Hyper-V in a Virtual Machine. This is because they are hypervisor, bare metal sofware, that means, virtualization software that runs directly on the hardward without a host OS, as you can imagine it has lots of performance advantages. However looks like in VMWare are really genius working and now you can do it, Since VMWare Worksation 8. (in earlies versions is not possible). 

Ideally, you don't ever want to put passwords in a command line, though, as there are multiple places it can show up (ps output, shell history, etc.), none of which are particularly secure. 

I can only assume you were matching on the capital A in April and it no longer works because it's now May. Maybe instead of 'A' you should be using '^'. 

RADIUS is a client/server protocol. Effectively, the client speaks RADIUS protocol to the server to ask if the authentication information provided is accurate. The AP is the client and there is another computer that is the server. Your school was considering changing to using RADIUS either from some other authentication protocol, or from authentication directly on the AP. 

When you created /Users/HMTS01/BACKUP, how did you set its ownership and permissions? You may need to set the mount point's metainfo manually before mounting the filesystem. 

I don't know how much money you're looking to spend, but I've been really happy with my Cisco 1130AG. I previously had a Linksys Draft-N AP that I ended up rebooting every night and still remained unstable. I have had zero problems with the Cisco. Of course, it cost like 8 times as much and doesn't support N. (They have some now that do, I think.) 

Which, to me, implies concatenation, or, at best, striping. Let's be generous and call it RAID0. So if I have to define two arrays, and arrays are spans, and spans are RAID0, then I'm defining two RAID0 sets. And if I have to define two of them, it'd make sense that it's mirroring those. But that would be a RAID1 of two RAID0s, or RAID0+1, which is bad. I'd expect, then, that if I defined three arrays, that would be creating a three-way mirror of RAID0 sets, but if I actually do that, the logical drive still has half the capacity of all the drives in total, not a third. So that conclusion doesn't make sense, either. The problem is that I have 18 drives I want in a RAID10 set. In every other RAID system I've used, I'd just create 9 two-drive mirrors and then stripe them, but I can't do that with MegaRAID. Because there have to be between two and eight arrays, and each array must have an even number of drives, the only config I can come up with that works is three arrays of six drives each, but I just feel strange doing that without having a better notion of how those disks are actually going to be laid out. Am I overthinking this? Should I just let MegaRAID do its thing and just hope that the drives are laid out optimally? 

A NIC dedicated to Virtual Machines. A NIC dedicated for management, that means for be use to the host. A NIC dedicated for iSCSI. A NIC dedicated for heart beat. This is the internal traffic of the cluster. If you are planing to use Live Migraton you should dedicated a NIC for that. 

Is there any recommened array for placing the disks of a virtual infraestrcture. As example, I heard that for the OS disk is recommened a mirror array. For placing virtual hard dkis which is recommended? 

Yes. You can do it using the command Rasdial. Thought i recommend you to configure the VPN using a Group Policy. You can see the procedure here: Configure a Virtual Private Network Connection Item 

For dont have this kind of issues the better choice is not to download the Symbols. Instead you can use a Symbols Server. This is a Microsoft place where they have saved the most recent symbols and if you configure it in your WinDbg will download the exact symbols that it needs on demand.` You define your symbols insted of a local hard drive path, something like: srvf:\symbols\websymbols$URL$ Check at this link how to configue Web Symbols on WinDbg. Regards. 

Yes. This is true. Ports are to bind and the apps with the network. You cannot have more than 65553 application connected by TCP and 65535 connect by UDP on the same host. Operating Systems tipically dinamycally managed the ports an assign one for each app that connects to the network. If you have two applications listeing on the same port when a network package arrives the computer couldn't know to what app is going to deliver the data. As example if you have Messenger and Skype on the same binded to the same port your messenger message will appear in skype and vice versa :) 

In your script you can copy the thing that you want to run to the local machine disk and after run it delete it. Use robocopy.exe \UNC-Path LocalDestionation to copy the file, run it and after that delete it. Remenber that you always have envitoment variables like %Temp% to use. For your case running using Sysinternals PSExec you can try make a bat that runs every bat line started with PSExec. You can use enviroment variables in the bat using the SET command for things like the username. Alternative I recommend you to test this free software that let you run remote commands very easy with a simple GUI: PQD Deploy. 

Turns out that init had simply stopped working properly, probably when the system was having I/O problems with swap. As it turns out, if init exits outside the process of shutting down the OS, it will simply restart. So I sent init a SIGSEGV (to make sure that it wouldn't mimic however it determines that a shutdown is in progress), it restarted init (still as pid 1), and the new init immediately reaped all of those outstanding zombies. However, I should probably reboot to clear whatever other problems might exist due to the swap I/O problems. 

Many vendors allow you to look at the support status of a device with no information besides a serial number. Does this exist for Cisco products? 

I've copied and pasted what I hope is the relevant config out of my ASA (5525) where this is working for both AnyConnect and MacOS-native clients. I have expurgated it of localized information, so I may have typoed something along the way. I hope I haven't left anything out. (Look out for comments.) 

† Thanks, HP! ‡ Do you think HP made that bet or not? I'm guessing they did, and always send VT100 codes. In which case, if your terminal isn't VT100-compatible, you won't be having this problem to begin with. 

(I'm not sure if I can even trust that message. It's so long, it just feels like a random offset into Outlook's stack of error messages.) Either way, the Exchange server is available to everyone else, and is available via OWA from that computer. I ran Process Explorer against Outlook and it showed 5 or so ESTABLISHED connections to our Exchange server, plus listening on two UDP ports, and two CLOSE_WAIT connections to localhost. If I managed to look at Outlook's IP connections while it was doing its Connecting/Disconnected dance, it had a huge number of connections open to the Exchange server. It more than filled ProcExp's dialog box; I'm guessing at least 20, probably more. The only other odd thing is that our network admin at some point added a wildcard DNS record to the domain name that we use for email, and now Outlook will sometimes (always?) start by complaining about autodiscover.example.com's SSL certificate. There is a web server there, but it doesn't have any sort of email autodiscover anything on it. It doesn't make any difference if I click "OK" or "Cancel" (or whatever the buttons are). I also added a bogus entry for the hostname to Windows' hosts file, pointing it at 127.0.0.2, and it stopped complaining about the certificate. (The CLOSE_WAIT sockets above were from before I made this change, and went away after.) I don't think this is related, as the same problem should exist for everyone, but it might be. This is the second time this user has had this problem. The first time, I never found a solution other than reinstalling Outlook. Now that it's a pattern, I'd like to find a permanent solution, rather than assume it's a random glitch. Edit: The user's Outlook started working again, partially, last night while at home connected to the office via VPN. It's unclear how much of the "partially" is due to me screwing around with his account settings. Probably a large portion. That said, once I recreated his account settings properly this morning, he says that a large number of folders were moved around. Honestly, this feels to me like user error, but it might also be a symptom of the problem. I'll have to come back to this if and when the problem crops up again. 

Other than the bad performance is completly possible to Install a Virtual Box virtual machine inside another virtual machine. Due VirtualBox doesnt virtualize Intel VT-X or AMD-V in its virtual machines and the VirtualBox requires those technolgies for run 64 virtual machines, the second Virtual Machine should be of 32 bits. 

You can acomplish that changint the path using MMC, adding the snaping Local Users and Groups, and changing the profile of the Path. After that if you get the Temporary Profile error you can fix it starting the computer with an account with addministrative rights. Open the registry (regedit.exe). HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList Delete the key with the SID of the USER. (This key will generated again after the user starts for the first time) If you dont know the SID of the user of you are running you can get it starting a command prompt with that user (run as works) and running whoami /user 

You can do it using the Windows Server 2008 R2 resource monitor. Run perfmom.exe and select Open Resource Monitor, go to the tab called Disk, and check the section called Disk Activity. There you can order by Read and Write bytes per second and one of the colums of that table is the file which are being accessed. Regards. 

You are right. A lot of companies doesn't have a a public DMZ so they cannot have two public IPs in the server witouht NAT. Without this Teredo doesnt work. In Windows Server 2008 for enable Direct Access from the GUI you have to enable Teredo, so if you don't have this requierement it won't work. You have two alternatives: 

There migh be an error in the communication from this new switch to the Domain Controller. The icon of public or domain network is managed by the Network Location Awareness (NLA) service. To detect if you are in your domain the NLA service do this two things: 

In the Hyper-V Manager you should not see anything. You should connect to the virtual machine by RDP to see it working. 

Rules in the Windows Firewall can be bundle together and activated or deactivated as a group. With command you can add rules to the Firewall. Use the switch for manage the AdvFirewall groups. Use something like this:
