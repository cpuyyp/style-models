However when one user sends mail to the other internally, it works OK if they send to John@mydomain.com but Thunderbird reports "User unknown in local recipient table." if they send to John.Doe@mydomain.com. 

Turn NUM LOCK on! I am typing Alt+0176 in Chrome: ° You can go back to a prior URL in Chrome by typing Alt+← but I don't think you can easily mistype one for the other with a normal keyboard layout Unless you have NUM-LOCK off! If you have NUM LOCK off pressing Alt+7 is the same as Alt+Home which takes you to your home page. Then pressing Alt+6 is the same as Alt+→ which takes you forward a page. 

The problem with encrypted or compressed files is that even if only one byte is modified in the data, all remaining file contents are different, not just the changed data byte. This defeats one strategy used by rsync to reduce data transfer - namely only transferring the changed sections of a file and not the whole file. So don't compress data unless you need space on the disk (in which case use disk-based compression as that is transparent to applications like rsync). Don't encrypt data unless you need to protect the privacy of the data should the computer (or disk) be stolen or lost. (Do keep backups of your data and especially of your encryption keys or recovery keys). Again, whole-disk encryption is likely to be least detrimental to rsync performance (but most likely to lead to a catastrophic loss of data when a hard disk fails and data-backups are not available, or when you reinstall the OS without backing up a recovery key for other data disks/partitions) The above assumes that (a significant number of) the relevant uncompressed/unencypted files are likely to have partial changes from time to time - by editing or appending of some sort - whilst the bulk of the data in the file remains unchanged. 

Full-text indexing There are tools such as recoll, swish-e and sphinx but you'd have to check if they can support the sort of search criteria you need. Recoll 

I would expect your router to block these attempts (unless the from addresses are local to your LAN). I would ensure the router's firewall functions are configured properly. If there is port forwarding for port 40959 I would turn that off unless there is a good reason for having it there. 

The traditional approach is to edit the user's login script to trap interrupts, run the program and then logout. You can set the user's login shell to be a restricted shell (man rksh) "Rksh is a restricted version of the command interpreter ksh; it is used to set up login names and execution environments whose capabilities are more controlled than those of the standard shell." Or use bash in restricted mode. Remove the user's write access to their login scripts (and anything else the program doesn't need to write to). For additional security chroot the user. 

Check CPU usage Use Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), select the Processes tab and click the CPU column header to sort processes by descending CPU usage. If there is a process (other than "idle") that is using most of your CPU, most of the time, you can stop that process or prevent it from loading at startup. Anti-Virus In some cases, anti-virus products can conflict with other software. Microsoft's Security Essentials occasional does so (look for "msmpeng" in task manager). You may be able to observe this using Task Manager. If so you can try temporarily disabling other startup processes one at a time and rebooting until the conflicting program becomes obvious. Startup programs Use the Start icon to run or search for "msconfig", this lists startup items and allows you to disable them. This can be useful for identifying programs that cause problems. Worst case Backup your data, check you can read all your backups, reinstall Windows, restore data. 

If was using Sublime Text for plain text notes, I would use the available support for plain text markup such as Markdown. There is Sublime Text support for highlighting Markdown. 

If you just want an open-source diagramming tool, there are many. The ones that immediately come to my mind are 

means that the server expects to receive three characters when you press Home. You can look at what is expected for other values of TERM 

There is no need for a vote or for speculation. Microsoft are quite clear about their policy for contacting customers by phone - they state that they don't ever make unsolicited calls of that sort. According to $URL$ 

One way virtualization might help is by copying a template VM, testing the files in the copied instamce of the template VM - presumably any infection will be of the guest OS in the VM and not of the host OS. Finally delete the VM but keep the clean template. There are many choices for virtualization software such as several basic VMware products. Since Windows 7 includes virtualisation I know of no good reason not to use that. 

In general I'd download and read the motherboard manual and check that there is an option that allows booting to continue without pressing a key after an erro e.g. on ASUS UEFI BIOS 

Someone memorably described this as killing an anthill one ant at a time. RPZ BIND also supports RPZ which can be used with publicly available blacklists (so you don't have to maintain your own lists) Proxy Some people feel a better solution is to use a HTTP-proxy such as Squid with Squidguard 

To test this I started Apache on my Vista PC. Then I opened a command prompt with administrator privileges and ran the command: 

Assuming your internet connection is floor 1, I'd disable DHCP service in "main router" and only use it's switch ports. I'd turn off it's wifi unless the floor2 wifi-only devices can't connect to the floor 1 router. Actually I'd buy a small gigabit switch, they're cheap, more efficient and less likely to cause confusing configuration problems. 

It probably uses the line-drawing characters in code page 850. Notepad doesn't support that encoding, it's default is "ANSI", by which Microsoft mean Windows-Latin1 or Code-Page-1252 if I remember correctly. Notepad++ or gVim etc should be able to display the characters correctly. 

Any of them. You just have to configure and use sudo appropriately. The manual page for sudoedit says 

The shell expands metacharacters in doubly-quoted strings and then passes the reult to the actual command (it's actually more complicated than this) Try using single quotes. 

Looks like you carelessly cut & pasted this script from an editor (vim?) rather than copying or transferring the file. This line should be deleted. Incorrect syntax The line 

Other ideas The canonical tool for scripting telnet is . The canonical tool for capturing terminal output is . In this case I think these would not suit your task (but you may disagree) 

What happens if he selects a small sample, uses "Edit", "Copy" and pastes into Notepad? I would try "File", "Save As" and save as plain text. That way you you have a chance of saving a separate copy of the written material separate from the formatted material. To prevent a recurrence, as well as regularly saving ("File", "Save"), make sure your friend knows how to make a backup of all his documents to at least one separate location (a set of USB sticks, another PC or two, some cloud-storage, etc). There are two kinds of PC users: those who have learned the worth of backups and those who are going to. 

Create a square mono-spaced font from Courier using your favourite font-editor. Use that in your Terminal. If you lack the patience for font editing and have charisma (or something) you can do this instead. The intertubes suggested this to me but maybe it isn't really square. 

Your webserver is redirecting but has not been configured with a DNS name so uses it's internal IP_address in the redirection response. Configure the domain name in the webserver software. 

10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX use pairs 2 and 3. 1000BASE-T uses all four pairs. Thus a simple tester can see if pairs 1 and 4 are crossed. Notice that the tester does not have indicators to differentiate between straight-through cables for 100BASE-T and 1000BASE-T as the connections are identical. 

You need to obtain the correct version of BOOTSECT.EXE (64-bit/x64 or 32-bit/x86) I think if you are creating the install media on a 32-bit Windows system, you need the 32-bit BOOTSECT.EXE (regardless of whether the USB mass-storage device will contain the ISO for a 64-bit Windows install). 

I believe that many motherboards can boot without a video system. (but I have no actual experience of this) Wikipedia says 

So you write that file, run Inno Setup and it produces a file that others can download and run to install program.exe on their Windows computer. 

If you read through the notes for each release you will build up a good picture of what features are in 2.x that are not in 1.x. E.g. support for smart-cards. 

You can automate interactive command line programs using Here's an example (for telnet) from the Wikipedia article 

In this BIOS setting, "IDE" means separate disks attached to the main disk controller will each be shown as one separate disk to the operating system (for example as C: and D:). 

As suggested by the comment of Dr Moishe Pippik, you have a mixture of left-to-right scripts and right-to-left scripts. As Wikipedia says 

provides 1 ms resolution and it's man page does not mention any attempt to take into account network latency and jitter. is part of and I believe is capable of working with nanosecond resolution. More importantly has well-honed and sophisticated algorithms for dealing with latency and jitter. Few people will need better than millisecond resolution of course. 

EFS - the "delayed recycling bin" It sounds like you may have replaced your hard disk, installed Windows on a new disk, attached the old disk and booted the new disk with the intent of copying your data to the new disk. If so: You have to boot Windows from the original disk, login with your original user name and password and then decrypt the files. If not: See I CAN NOT RECOVERY MY PHOTOES ENCRYPTED BY EFS AFTER TO FORMAT 

Update: According to Adobe Reader (File, Properties, Description, Title) the title of $URL$ is "GraphTheory.dvi". I was able to cut that and paste it into a file name. The first two lines of the text in the PDF are "Lecture Notes on", "GRAPH THEORY". I cut those out and pasted them into a file name - this resulted in a file name of "Lecture notes on". I didn't get the error message you refer to. 

This is only a warning. It may indicate that your configuration file needs attention. It wouldn't stop Apache starting up. 

One bit on my 2 TB hard disk occasionally changes from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. This seems to be an occasional read error. I found this out because I have a program which runs at startup, computes SHA1 hashes of all my data files, and reports any that are different from hash values saved the last time. I happened to have an extra copy of the affected file, so I am able to perform a bitwise comparison. The file is a JPEG image file and I can view it without any reported problem (so the bit must be in the RGB data values rather than any crucial image metadata or header part). My disk's SMART info suggests there is no problem. 

You could buy an absolutely identical drive and swap the circuit board. However the easiest solution is to toss it in the bin, buy a new drive and restore your important data from your backup. 

If you break the document into "Sections" by inserting section breaks, you can then have different footers in each section. 

I have a Postfix 2.5.1 on a Debian 4.0 PPC server. I intend to use this as an SMTP relay for outgoing email from my mobile phone (as my phone service provider recently dropped their SMTP server). The Postfix server is behind a NAT router to which I have added some port-forwarding rules for inbound SMTP. This works OK. Currently the has a large set of restrictions listed under which are not needed and which end with (which I understand is the default anyway if all rules are inapplicable) I don't know why the existing doesn't have rules organised under other sections like etc as the Postfix docs do. However I feel it's best for me to use the conventions in the main.cf supplied with the software rather than re-organise. in main.cf can I simplify my restrictions to this? 

The problem you describe is typical of an incorrect value for the TERM environment variable. Specifically, the value of the TERM variable on Ubuntu selects a set of terminal features and capabilities that do not match those of the OS X Terminal application. If TERM is set to something like or try setting it to other values (e.g. the other one from the two I mentioned, or plain , or ). 

My first thought was: "fonts don't have the capabilities (unless someone unusually obsessive does something exceptionally clever in true-type hinting)" but it turns out I am wrong, there are fonts with some of the features you seek: 

OpenSSL can be made portable in the sense of running from a USB drive without being installed. You would need both OSX and Windows versions of the programs on the same USB drive. You could set up batch-files/scripts that your boss could invoke if they are comfortable with simple command-line usage on both platforms. The link above provides drag & drop encryption/decryption through Windows Explorer. You might be able to create something similarly graphical for OSX. 

Since has options for checking and files, you can spell-check some or produced by . I imagine you could also use on text output from - assuming that removes any mark-up (e.g. asterisks) that might confuse . 

Important data should always be stored in at least two places. I backup everything important every day. I used to use tapes but nowadays I mostly use a combination of external disks and copies to other computers. It is still important to keep at least one copy in a different building. With USB attached storage, always use the operating system's tools to make the device ready for removal before unplugging it or turning it's power off. 

I create a gojava script in my home directory. It just adds the java SDK directory to the PATH. This isn't the approved method but I dislike having a huge PATH. Open a command prompt window from Start menu or a desktop shortcut ... 

UPDATE: The Windows explorer address bar usually shows drive letter and path (e.g. ) but you can type in a URL like those above, it can then be used as a drag&drop target for uploading a file to an FTP server. 

I'd use Wireshark to see what is being sent where and a book on TCP/IP (Comer, Stevens, ...) to understand why. 

In reality I expect unplugging is rarely a cause of any problems. You might theoretically draw a small spark from a live conductor which could cause problems.
