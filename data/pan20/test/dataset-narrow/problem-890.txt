named.conf is the BIND configuration file, you will have .hosts and .rev files for your forward and reverse look up settings respectively in your If your registrar is also your DNS service provider, then you do not need DNS entries in both places. 

If the user is roaming, check if telnet to port 25,110,143 is occurring. Since you are not facing an issue with sending mails from the web interface a host of factors including connectivity, your hosts software firewall/antivirus settings or as a few other suggested before me, a corruption of your Mail Client profile could cause this to happen. If you have been provided by a web interface to sent out mails, try using that for a while till you diagnose the root cause of your current problem. 

Enable detailed error mode on the web server. THis will allow the content and description of the error occuring to filter down the client of the API - see what the error says and it will give you a better clue. Alternatively, view the Application event log (start run --> eventvwr.msc) and look for Warnings with a source of ASP.NET - error 500s get logged this way on the iis web server - what's the error occuring? Ensure you have set in the web.config of the webapi website on IIS - when debug mode is true, it enables server-side recompiles every time a connection is made to the website (thus locking the files from access by any other client connection). 

You can telnet to localhost on port 25 and try sending the message from there to your local user account and then check the mails if the local delivery is happening. Then you can check of remote mail delivery to gmail is happening. It is always advisable to have a static I.P Address with proper reverse DNS entry set when trying to relay mails directly to the internet, the other option is to use a relay server, either the relay server of your ISP or a third party relay server. For incoming mails, the mails come in via the MX records, so if the MX records for your domain point to your server/machine then your mails will reach your machine. If the MX records for your domain does not point to your server then you can configure an application like fetchmail to fetch mails from your Mail Hosting Provider at regular intervals. There is yet another option where mails can be relayed to your server (say if you also have a hosted incoming email/spam filtering service) from a third party server and your server should accept/allow the mails from those I.P Addresses/ I.P Address range without any authentication. The actual ways of implementing the above is actually left to you. ps: I use postfix and Cyrus. Hope this information helps. 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get rid of "www" in the url. I am looking for giving access to the website when you type down mywebiste.co as well as redirecting www.mywebsite.co to mywebsite.co I have tried through apache2, in the configuration files and create a virtual host but that didn't work from the tutorial I used. I'm thinking maybe I have to configure something else with AWS ? I don't really know what to look for to be honest. therefore my post here. I own the domain name with GoDaddy, and use Route 53 and EC2 on AWS to have my servers set up. You can try it here : www.meetmyfriends.co Many thanks. 

I've just set up route 53 on AWS to link my server (ubuntu) to a godaddy domain name. I used to be able to access my /var/www/mmf folder from the elastic IP address given by aws (54.214.246.243/mmf) and since I've set up the route 53 service and linked it to the directory of my website, I can only access it through the domain address (www.meetmyfriends.co). My problem is that I have other directories on this same server I would like to access, I usually did 54.214.246.243/myotherdirectory to access other projects that didn't need any domain name. And now I can't. Why is this happening ? How can I fix this ? I want to be able to access my www server folder from my ip address 54.214.246.243 and the mmf sub directory (my website) from the web address in the same time. So i can still access the other projects on development I have on this server. How can I set that up. Thanks for your help :) EDIT: Maybe is this due to my httpd-vhosts.conf file: 

The retention of log files depends on the criticality of the data being logged and the actual size of the storage medium on which the logs are stored as well as the various compliance procedures in the geographical location where the Server is hosted. There is no hard and fast rule to the number of days the logs files should be retained though logs for at least a month ( space willing) would not be a bad idea. Storing old logs as tar.gz files is also a nice idea if space is a constraint. 

BIND stands for Berkeley Internet Name Domain, is the most commonly used Domain Name System (DNS) server on the Internet. Named is the daemon used by BIND. 

Disable anonymous authentication and enable Windows Authentication. The client computers and the server itself will both need to be joined to the same AD domain for this to work. You then grant each AD user read/execute permissions to the web root folder (NTFS folder permissions) - the authentication is then automatic - the users will either get a 403 access denied, or they'll see the website. The identity of the application pool itself plays now part in this (however, don't use Network Service, this is poor security practice anyway, switch to ApplicationPoolIdentity). Also, for managing access to the website, don't grant individual users direct read/execute access to the webroot folder. Instead, create an AD group, make all users who need the site members of the group, then grant the group read/execute access to the website. 

First check if your motherboard supports visualization, then go for Xen, Qemu or KVM whichever suits your need. 

The 'transport_maps' option in the postfix main.cf is the one that should be used. The transport_maps points to /etc/postfix/transport.db file that contains the entries. You can add the transport entries in /etc/postfix/transport file and run the 'postmap' command which will generate the transport.db file. 

The PTR record is a must have for all Mail Servers that directly relay mails to the Internet failing which many DNS Blacklist will outright reject mails originating from the I.P Address and it could get your I.P Addresses blacklisted globally and many of the DNS Blacklists are globally replicated depending on the Blacklist. 

Can you paste the output of the /var/log/messages that that you have, just before the server got re-booted ? It is not possible to find out the reason for the lockup without checking the log files. Also is the lockup recurring or was it a one off event ?
