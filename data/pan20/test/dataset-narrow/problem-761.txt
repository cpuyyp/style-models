We have samba server with lots of documents there. Server is in busy LAN, but only two computers works there using two samba user accounts. Very often Microsoft Excel can not open or can not save particular files. Here is my samba conf file: 

is this just by accident or not? Because of the traffic, I will not worry for lots of "possible SYN flooding" messages, but those are every 60 sec. Here are our custom settings in /etc/rc.local 

"from" or "caller id" is supported with many providers. However, when the provider re-transmit the SMS, sometimes this field is lost. In some countries there are regulations and local GSM providers remove the field as well. For example in South Africa you can use text like "NIKI", you can use long phone number like "+491234512345", but you can not use short phone number like "1234". Disclamer: I am working for SMS provider and on some routes, we support "from": $URL$ 

I don't like this approach because it will do mount for each directory, but at least this is safe and will works correctly. for files, I can do hard links, but I do not like the idea very much, because I can "lost" the link easily if I do something like: 

(Yes I did three in a row) For my surprise, when I started MySQL, everything get back to normal. What could be the problem and can I automate the "drop caches" somehow to prevent the server of slow down at least for next couple of days. 

I have dovecot installation and I want to enable indexing (e.g. faster retrieval of IMAP STAT command) If I do: 

I do not seems to find any information about this. Dovecot version is 2.0.9. Config file is just this: 

current time on the server is ~9:30 file /DATA/SMB/incoming/Special offers/SPECIAL OFFERS_2017.xls was not open from anyone except from the same user that reported the problem. Only one Microsoft Excel was started there - I'm trying to explain that is not some problem the user made. 

I have a Linux NAS file server with PPTP. I have several clients that use Windows only (no Linux, MacOS or mobile phones). I want all those clients to be able to connect to the NAS server only (no external resources), without installing any additional software on the client side. Also I want setup to be as smooth as possible, e.g. accepting defaults only. Currently everything works with defaults, except because of default gateway, clients can not access anything but the file server. Is there any option I can set up on the server to fix this. 

I use RAID1 with SSD's from about an year. There are no problems there, but having different drives sometimes may kill write performance. There were some option - "writemostly" - check about it. I use this option on one server where I do raid with sata and ram disk. 

It currently works ok, but I want when: Someone sent mail to , the email to be stored in both and . Also I want a copy of the email to be forward to person personal email - Same if someone sent to , the email to be stored in both and . In this case I do not want any email to be sent to How is easier way to set up this with ? 

I have address that is not valid. If someone write email there, I want so send autoresponce there and to forward the email to someone else. I did forwarding with : 

My question is why there is sleep after kill? It seems unnecessary, because even reopen slows, gzip will not be able to compress everything for 1 second anyway? Do they do it this way in case file is very small, so no data to be lost? 

I want to track random config files / directories from my server into git repository. I do not mean tracking the /etc, here are some examples: 

Short answer - setting must be equal to number of local indexes. long ansewer - it depends : In case of CPU bound workload, setting dist_threads to 1x the number of cores is advised (creating more threads than cores will not improve query time). In case of mixed CPU/disk bound workload it might sometimes make sense to use more (so that all cores could be utilizes even when there are threads that wait for I/O completion). 

I have some CentOS 6.x servers. They have and works well there. On one of the servers, I decided to do and . I can mount it with and there is no error message. However if I decide to run , I get this: 

Update: You need to choose a provider and then test for specific country / GSM network you need to send SMS-es to. Most of the providers will give you small test credit or will send test SMS-es. 

I have CentOS 6.x Linux server with kernel . I did some checks today and I found that disk elevator is "deadline". 

Google Apps are ready to receive mail for your domain even before you set the MX records. This is not written in the documentatuon, but is known fact. When you change the MX recirds to Google's, there will be period of propagation of cource. During this perion, some emails will go to gGoogle Apps, some will go to your old mail server. You can ask your users to check both Google Apps and old mail servers for a week, or you can download the mails from your old POP3 to Google Apps. In this second scenario, assuming you have all the mails on old server, you can migrate all the mail to Google Apps as well. Only "disadvantage" to this second download is you need to use "fake" email identification during the download - e.g. use something like user@domain.old.com instead the real domain. When you try to set it up you will see what I mean. Another disadvantage will be you need to do this as per user basis. If you have 4-5 users will be fast, but you might have 100 users or even more. Finally during this download you can set up rules so the old emails will go to respective folders etc. Hope this adds new useful info to existing posted answer. 

I try to establish VPN to a remote server. However I get strange error - "no shared key found for" and I can not find any usable information for it. strongswan configutation is as following: 

I have archlinux with samba. I noticed from last update it started avahi-daemon. If I stop/disable avahi, seems samba starting avahi automatically. Also tried with kill. Printing is disabled in samba. How can I prevent samba to start avahi after samba start? 

On my I did online filesystem resize using . The only program running on this disk was sphinx search. I noticed that sphinx server had lots of: 

On this server I will have some maildirs with 100,000+ messages, so any other improvements will be welcome. 

My server have one IP and several domains hosted. One and same IP appear in named.conf and several zone files. When the IP address of the server changes, I need manually to change all those IP's. Is there a way to do something like: in named.conf: 

The disk supports trim and there is raid1 made with same disks. Is this because RedHat did not backported something into the kernel or I am doing something wrong? 

I have almost same server, but installed 4 mo ago. it is with kernel . It's scheduler is "cqf" as expected. Is there some changes in the kernel, or just my hosting company did it? I also can not find where this is set - is stock. 

When we perform stress test on our sphinx search cluster, requests always go to around ~250 and never go higher. we are using CentOS 6.x Our TCP settings are: 

Dedicated CentOS 6.x server running Postfix + Dovecot 2.0.9 in some data center. 5-6 Windows 10 client computers with latest Thunderbird (IMAP) Some Windows 7 client computers with latest Thunderbird (IMAP) 

One possible explanation is the open files were closed. Is online resize2fs ext4 close/reset all open files? 

Note that timestamp is wrong. Is this corrupted file, incidental random "magic number" or there is a way to unzip it somehow. 

Both certificates are installed correctly. Never used Symantec, but they have problems with their own SSL authority so I would never relie to them. Easiest standalone check would be with (yes, it is very very strict and picky). Another way is to use $URL$ Hope that helps. 

Because someone steals content from our website, I need to create additional log file, that logs only if http_referrer contains specific domain. Currently I have this: 

my five cents on the issue - in our PHP project we have few 404 pages, so I decide to do it on PHP level using PHP header() functions 

I am trying to restore some deleted files from one server. Using several tools for raw disk scan, I found lots of files - gz, gif, jpg etc. I also found some multi-part gzip files that I do not know how not handle. This is what I get when I try to extract:
