Agreed that this should probably be migrated, but in the meantime, here is some insight for you. Caveat: On the whole, this is not best practice for a setup using the technology you've indicated; you'd gain far more reliability and performance by running your configuration directly off of the hypervisor and either getting software RAID to manage your disks directly, or spending the money to purchase a hardware RAID card. (Answering 2. first, for logistics) 2: You haven't specified, I'm going to assume you plan on using ESXi. An isolated mirrored set will offer the the most reliable configuration the ESXi OS. If you're concerned about resiliency/fault tolerance of the hypervisor, again I would strongly recommend against using software RAID to do this at all (ESXi doesn't play nice with most software RAID, and even if your controller is supported, you're still dealing with (at best) BIOS-based software RAID reliability and performance). If you decide to do this, ensure that your data/VM disk set is entirely independent from your hypervisor disk set, and back up your ESXi configuration frequently. 1: Once you have your hypervisor running, assuming ESXi supports your hardware for Raw Device Mapping you could then expose your SAS disks directly to your virtual BSD instance and z-pool/z-raid them as you like, exposing them via NFS to other VMs or computers in your house. If ESXi doesn't support RDM for your hardware, the only other option would be to create virtual volumes from the ESXi hypervisor and expose them to your virtual BSD instance. Why this is a very bad idea: you're layering a software RAID filesystem on top of virtual partitions. If you lose your z-pool configuration, you're liable to lose the entire array because you're dealing with a physical file system (ZFS) sitting on top of a virtual filesystem (VMFS). 

copy one of the formulas in the non-filling column to a holding cell delete all the entries in the column in the table. copy back the formula to the first cell in the column in the table. 

Purging duplicates from a data set like this to give unique entries can be done in Excel using the Data => Remove Duplicates option in the ribbon. Multiple fields (even all fields) in the selected range/table can be selected. Below is a generic sample how it might look. To analyse different age groups I would recommend using a "helper column" with a formula to flag entries according to the desired criteria. e.g. then create a pivot-table, display the results in table format and filter the pivot-table by the helper column. 

BTW: I have had slightly different issues with tables but in my case it was filling an old formula. - see excel-table-inserting-old-formula-in-new-rows-how-can-i-reset-to-the-new-formula. 

Try pressing CTRL+6 on the keyboard (using the 6 above "T Y"). This will cycle between three display modes: hiding objects, displaying objects, and displaying placeholders for objects. I have the problem you describe from time to time and this always works for me. It normally happens when I have an image or a chart embedded on the sheet. 

Given the number of people has to be a whole number <2 is equivalent to <=1. To do this just use the "Number" option in the conditional formatting as per the screen grab. 

I am trying to edit the meta data in the Word normal.dotm default template but changes to the {Company} field won't save. Changes to {Position} are saved but if I delete my name Word just restores this automatically to the template. Google search on this problem has been fruitless. (FWIW: I have done this in the default Excel template without any problem.) 

I think by disabling the 'separate spacies' functionality of Mavericks, you should be able to accomplish this: Click on System Preferences > Mission Control > Un-tick “Displays have separate Spaces”. Once your restart your Mac, you will have just a single menu bar. Done. 

In the end, you may find that breaking up your function into several chunks (or using matching) will help you strip it apart. Here is a basic summary of what I've ended up using: 1: Set some global variables to allow for flexibility: 

If you're still getting nowhere, you might try a 3rd party firmware (DD-WRT, Tomato). If after that you still haven't gotten anywhere, you've spent more hours than your time is worth, and you might just want to buy a new router ;) 

(expected, from what I understand). The problem: Sublime doesn't seem to recognize the NVM path. Take this build system: 

If you bought it a week ago, you might try returning it to the store you bought it from and exchanging it for another one, a different model, or a different brand altogether. 

Edit: In the end, if you actually just want the python script I've written, let me know and I'll post it on sourceforge or git. 

Unfortunately this is not possible to do exclusively with Group Policy. You will need to consider one of the other 3rd party solutions to accomplish what you want. (Those, however could be controlled through GP if you like?). Here is a supporting TechNet thread. 

Your best bet is to use a can of compressed gas (available at most computer/stationary stores). You can find a lot more information in this PC World article, and I'm sure there are many others around the Internet. 

copy and paste-values from the table column that needs to be fixed to a blank column not adjacent to the table. delete all the values from the table column put the preferred formula the first cell in the column. The table should auto-fill the table column with this formula. paste back the values from the temporary column into the table. 

You just need to add a way to tag the agents that are not available and calculate an index for each cell. I added two rows above the agent labels, the first allows agents to be tagged as not available. I added some conditional formatting to cell colour and strike out the name of unavailable agents. The other is a helper row which is a incremental index for available agents of the form I also added a helper column which is just the row index starting at 0. (The helper columns could be directly incorporated into the table formula but it makes it harder to read. The helper row and column can obviously be hidden). The formula in the table just uses a simple formula. The table formula is 

There are limitations to using Excel as a database for multiple users and your example is one of them. (see also one-excel-file-multiple-editing-users-live-updates) As a kludge/workaround I'd recommend the following: 1) in the 'data' workbook, some VBA code to the worksheet's module to auto save the Workbook when a new "entry" has been recorded. Something like the example will work, but replace "C:C" with the column where you want the save to occur. This is just so it doesn't save when every field is completed, only on one of them. 

The way you've described it won't work -- you can pin the folder to the Windows Explorer icon on the taskbar, but when you click it, it will simply open up the folder with your icons. Number of clicks for this scenario: 3 (or 4 if you're double clicking to open the application). Have you thought about adjusting the taskbar icons to be a smaller size? Then you can pin more: 

Turns out that root can't access that location. Moved the file to and then the password reset worked. 

What's the correct way to fix this to make Sublime's $PATH match Terminal's $PATH? I'd expect it to continue to work even when I switch Node versions with NVM too. Edit: Yes, I'm using the omf solution for NVM, which works because I can run both and from Terminal directly. 

You cannot natively pass a password to the command, however you may consider looking at PsExec from SysInternals. 

You don't need to spend that much on obtaining a firewall product that offers you granular control over NAT/masquerading. Some standalone firewall/gateway products that will install on minimal hardware: 

Inspecting the output from running , it kindly indicates that it's logging to . The notable part it says: 

First, there is a difference between quality and resolution. Be sure you adjust both independently (you don't need to stream a 4K video at 10% quality; you'd be much better to stream a 480p video at 80% quality). Second, depending on the compression or video container you're using, the quality and/or resolution could vary significantly. You're best to decide on a modern container/encoding or offer up multiple versions of your video (e.g. an .mp4 streaming in HTML5 and a flash-based .flv video, or at least the HTML5 stream). Last, it's extremely inefficient to determine the resolution/compression based on percentage calculation. Most modern video editors (Final Cut, Adobe Premiere) allow you to export at a target bitrate, and will let you adjust both resolution and compression to meet that target bitrate. 

My solution uses a simple first-in/first-out formula but it would be possible to adjust the formula using the weekday number to start the allocation at a different cell so table is biased towards the agents in the left hand column. 

I have a workbook with data connections to a number of TXT files containing data. I had to change the source file on one of them which all worked fine. However when I did a “refresh all” the data from the original TXT file came through. When I refreshed just that file the new data came through. I checked the connection list there was only one and it was pointing to the old file but when I looked in the names there were two overlapping names ranges. I deleted one and that fixed the problem. I’ve never seen this ghost problem before. Is there any reason for concern? 

Given the output of the data analysis script is a text file the easiest way to translate this into Excel is by setting up a data connection. Once setup, the data connection can be refreshed to import new data. On the 'Data' tab in the ribbon choose 'From text file' then follow the wizard. (There are lots of options here and there are many parameters. It would take to long to go over them in this answer but there are many resources online such as: How to import a text file into Excel 2010) TWO OPTIONS 1. If you save the output data to DIFFERENT TXT files each times but use a single spreadsheet but you should leave, from the "Properties" window, the 'Prompt for file name on refresh' checked. 

Local port forwarding is when the LISTEN port is established on the client side. I.e. you open a local port 80 on your machine, connected to someotherplace:80 on your server side. Reverse port forwarding is when the LISTEN port is established on the server side. I.e. you open a remote port 8080 on the server, conected to your_proxy:8080 Dynamic acts as a SOCKS proxy. Sample scenarios: 

As for your last question, in your example (assuming empty rules before those commands) you are setting a first rule and a second rule that would accept traffic from a certain network. IPTABLES grabs a match as soon as it can, so the first rule always matches (no condition set) so every rule after that won't execute. Exceptions to a rule must be defined before the rule. In the first example , you are setting a last rule that will catch whatever was not matched before, so any exception added will be executed before that default rule (). inserts into a certain position (for example, in my previous command, I am setting the ESTABLISHED,RELATED rule to be the first so it matches no matter what you set after that. appends to the rule list, so if will be matched just before the default. If you want to achieve the same as the first example with explicit rules (like ), you should exchange possitions of those. 

assings the backup extension to the files and the option makes it to use , and so on, so in order to change it you must create a script to change the behaviour. This script would create a copy of every image under to a single folder destination (would not create any subdirectory), avoiding collisions by appending a number to the file, just before the extension. Note that every time it is run, it will duplicate every file, just as your script does. The part is needed for filenames with spaces. 

2) in the pivot-table & pivot-chart workbook a) Add VBA code to module to automatically open the data workbook, like the following: 

NETWORKDAYS or NETWORKDAYS.INTL will calculate the number of 'work days' given a start date (say in B1), end date (say in B2) and list of holidays (say in B4:B40). The holidays could be public holidays or other days off when the allowance is not paid. The solution is then either: OR (The third term - - in NETWORKDAYS.INTL allows the "weekend" to be set more easily. Excel should give a pop up window explaining the different options. NETWORKDAYS() assumes it is Saturday and Sunday) There's plenty of tips on how to use this online, here's two: excel-networkdays-function, excel networkdays.intl function 

Make C1:C4 a named range called "List_Fruit" Make D1:D4 a named range called "List_Dogs" (These could also be defined dynamically) Make the data validation list source 

To reference a table within conditional formatting formula you will need to use . Your formula will thus be : I don't know why but it just works. Reference: How to use a table name in data validation lists and conditional formatting formulas (BTW: Why don't you just use the "Data Bar" Conditional Formatting in your table? It would be much easier.) 

You just need to pass the variant to a string type variable so you can use the function. This code works for me. Obviously edit to suit. 

Note: The formula must return a number, date, or time value. This is explained in the Excel help (my version is 2010) Since either an IF statement or other boolean functions return true/false, they will not work. 

POP3 is a one-directional protocol, in that once you download mail, it resides on your POP3 mail client, and has no further communication with the server until the next time you poll for new mail. This article elaborates: $URL$ Some mail servers block the POP3 'delete' function and retain a copy on the server, but unlike IMAP, there is no client/server relationship. Your best option is to re-create your mail profile using IMAP (or Exchange ActiveSync if it's an Exchange/Outlook.com server) so that your client can bi-directionally communicate with the server. 

Notice the host color is different? I copied the entire folder over to the computer, but it's still not working. The only difference I can think of is the version - 2.1.2, vs. 2.5.0. Here's my : 

Your virtual machine, if properly isolated from your web services, wouldn't likely be vulnerable to attack unless your entire machine / root account were compromised. That said, if you're concerned about data performance/reliability/resiliency on the NAS instance, you're going to find that running your NAS off of a virtual machine with (unknown) specs is probably going to cause you more headache than it's worth if you're hosting existing server-services on the host OS. If your specs on the existing desktop are less than spectacular, you'd be better too obtain a new dedicated box for your NAS. If your specs are high-end, you may want to consider a hypervisor solution (like VMware ESXi) and virtualize both your web server and your NAS in isolation on top of ESXi. 

Quite confident there is no way to do this on the device itself. Microsoft mentions the following: $URL$
