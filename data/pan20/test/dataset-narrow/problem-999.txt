you might need to add to kernel boot options if you've converted a fairly old ext2 to ext4, it might be lacking online resize capability with the only solution - create new ext4 fs and then move your files there (sad, but true) if you've converted a fairly old ext2 to ext4, you might notice a .journal file at the root. it does not appear on other mount points, since hides it automatically. Sadly it canot do the same to / mount point - you need live cd or any other running system to hide this node 

This clearly suggests that it is capable of utilizing more than 4 GiB of RAM, provided that it is used with the CPU also capable of 36-bit addressing. It is also worth noting that paragraph states that . However it is further clarified, that maximum usable RAM is limited to 8 GB. This once again declares the difference between addressable and usable as I was trying to convey in the CPU section. To conclude this, I'd like to note that two related chipsets have in fact huge difference in memory handling. Lets inspect Intel® Pentium® Processor Extreme Edition 840. It does support 64-bit instruction set, but does not support PAE. Which means that if run in 32-bit mode, it will be unable to use more than 4 GiB of RAM (please, correct me if I'm wrong with this assumption). Lets check the datasheet and table . Even though that this CPU is 64-bit capable, it is still limited by it's address bus being 36-bit wide, thus limiting it to accessible address range starting from 0 to 64 GiB. Now lets examine a more recent CPU. Take Intel® Core™ i7-7700 Processor for example. It is advertised to support up to 64 GB of RAM. Now lets check the datasheet of it. Paragraph convinces us that this CPU's addressable range is from 0 up to 512 GiB due to 39-bit address bus. Note that it is still far from the theoretical 16 EiB range for a 64-bit CPU. Surprisingly though it further clarifies that this CPU does support up to 32 GiB of usable RAM maximum (contrary to 64 GB on the website). There is also an image of interest here : 

after running Netflix for the first time I am unable to listen to two of my favorite stations: $URL$ and $URL$ – although Internet Explorer has no problem playing either of those two radio stations. Firefox has no problem, however, playing Netflix – the sound comes through like a champ. Any suggestions? (I have downloaded a new Firefox and have downloaded a new Flash player – no difference, the same problem) 

Well, I bit the bullet: I went to personalization and selected "high contrast white" and then choosing colors I thought appropriate for each Windows element. The resulting windows are certainly unique! :-) But it works! 

When – and why – should one be used over the other. Sometimes: element.value = "Fred"; works and sometimes element.innerHTML = "Fred"; works how come? 

I recently started receiving the above-mentioned error which is apparently a Winsock error message it is preventing me from checking my e-mail with Gmail, although there is no problem with my e-mail was ATT e-mail and MSN mail. I found a number of supposed fixit programs which found a great number of errors in my registry (although Wyse and Glary did not find anything wrong with my registry?) And offered to fix them for a fee. I would much rather not pay! :-) Does anybody here know what is causing this error and how to fix it? oh – I am using Windows 7/ultimate and Live Mail as my e-mail reader. Thank you. Ross 

I ran an SFC on my system and it tells me that there were some "Integrity Violations" and to see the log file for more details. So I was able to open it up in Notepad, but I have no idea what I'm looking at. Anybody have an idea? Ross 

this is getting weirder and weirder: without changing anything on my system, I was ready to pack it in and just reinstall Windows with an in-place install. So I clicked on control panel one last time. It worked like a champ. Right now everything is working. Keeping my fingers crossed! :-) 

It is a rather complicated question as it takes several components to work out. Those components are: 

It does a good job illustrating the issue with memory shadowing by PCI devices etc. Also it suggests a way of overcoming this issue by mapping a range from real RAM to upper address range within CPU-addressable range. Thus reclaiming that hidden memory for use. Note that this remapping is done by BIOS/(U)EFI upon hardware initialization and it is exactly for this reason I did include BIOS/(U)EFI in bullet-list above. I have taken Intel products as an examples, but the same is true for AMD. Now lets discuss how Operating Systems are involved. The Linux kernel includes full PAE mode support starting with version 2.3.23 and it is perfectly possible to have more than 4 GiB of memory usable with Linux kernel on a 32-bit system. However be aware of an undetermined issue with 32-bit Linux kernel on a system with more than 4 GiB of RAM on some hardware (in my experience it has something to do with TLB shootdowns). Anyway Wikipedia has a good information on PAE support. Interesting is how Windows XP is limited to 4 GB, whereas Windows Server 2003 Enterprise/Datacenter SP2 is capable of full 64 GB. Same is for other Desktop-Server Windows pairs. As you can see there are many combinations among components listed and in some cases replacing a CPU or OS might help. It is much harder to deal with BIOS/(U)EFI or MCU since the former is proprietary and built-in into the system and not easily modifiable, the latter is built into the CPU or soldered on board. 

Proxocket written by Luigi Auriemma. It intercepts API calls and saves captured traffic as Wireshark-ready .cap file in tcpdump format. Nothing is more explanatory than an image provided by Luigi himself: NirSoft has SocketSniff application which allows one to capture a traffic of a specific process. A picture is worth a thousand words as well: 

I have been a happy user of AutoHotKey for over a year. Not a problem. Ever. Until about two weeks ago. Sometimes after I run it, it doesn't function at all. No error message or anything it just doesn't work. When that occurs I run it again. Sometimes that fixes the problem, sometimes it doesn't. Here's the script that I use: Ins::^numpadadd Del::^numpadsub So when you hit the insert it gives a control plus, likewise when you hit the delete key it gives a control minus; basically to enlarge or decrease the stuff displayed on the screen. The even funkier problem: when this problem manifests itself hitting the control key with the plus or minus works as expected. No software has been installed or uninstalled nor have any substantial updates been made. Does anyone have any idea of what the problem may be and how to fix it? Thanks! Ross 

I recently used Defraggler to consolidate my free space areas on my D: drive preparatory to using Disk Manager to break my drive into two areas, one as my "data area" for Windows 7 (normally on my C: drive) and to experiment around with Windows 8. The Defraggler program works so well I ran it on my C: drive and I ended up with a lot of free space both on my C: drive and my D: drive. I was very happy. And then I woke up the next day and I've got virtually no free space left, something like 8 MB on my C: drive and about 3 GB on my D: drive. I then ran Wintree (which gives a nifty graphical representation of disk usage) and found I had a large page file and a large hiberfil. So I temporarily turned off hibernate and reduced the page file size to 2000megabytes and then rebooted so that both would take effect. It had no effect on the C: drive or the D: drive. That makes no sense to me. What caused the free space on each drive to disappear, why doesn't the page file size being reduced and the hibernate file being turned off free up disk space to either the C: or the D: drive? Would it make sense to delete the two files in question and, if so, how do I go about doing that? Safe mode? Thanks. Ross 

I often have to post files on different sites and some websites' forms only have a browse button to upload from your computer. If I have the file on another website, usually I have to go: 

In alot of senses it will be exactly like as if it were a normal drive, so you could lose unsaved data and the file system could become corrupted. It can be kind of annoying if an encrypted file system is corrupt and won't mount anymore, but I if I'm not mistaking truecrypt offers some option to decrypt data without mounting it so you can get on it with traditional tools to recover data. I cannot really give you good references here, but that is from my memory of how truecrypt works. I wouldn't be surprised if the truecrypt documentation talks about this. 

I have this 7mb pdf that I made from 65 scanned B/W images. After OCR, the document becomes 32mb. I have never seen text taking up so much space. (in theory 25mb should give me 25 million letters uncompressed) Saving in plain text I have about 4KB/page * 65 = +/- 280KB of text. Leaves the rest of 32mb for the positioning since I make a searchable image? Unlikely. Something seems wrong and I want to have a look at the space taken up by different parts of the pdf, but I can't find any tool that seems to do this. EDIT: The issue with the pdf in question has been resolved. The culprit was having searchable image vs searchable image (exact). It must have resampled some of the images which made them a lot bigger. Still interested in an answer to the question though. 

Somehow I had uninstalled the gnome-session package, probably by uninstalling evolution. After reinstalling that it worked again. 

Eg. have firefox take the file from the cache or download it silently and upload it transparently. I hope I won't have to write that myself...
