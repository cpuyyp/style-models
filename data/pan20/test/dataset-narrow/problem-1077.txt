....and you will not run into all the error messages and find will be able to search through your entire file system for any directories containing valgrind. 

It will not expand beyond the original amount you allocated for it. From virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html 

Click the Start Menu and type and hit Enter Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Policies > Attachments With Attachments selected look in the right window pane for a DWORD Value called SaveZoneInformation, double-click it and enter a value of 1 (if the Attachments key does not exist, and there's a good chance it won't, go to the next step). 3a. If you do not see the Attachments key in Policies, do the following: right-click on Policies and select New and then select Key. Name this key Attachments. Now right-click on Attachments and select New and then select DWORD (32-bit) Value. Name this value SaveZoneInformation. Now double-click SaveZoneInformation and set its value to 1. Now reboot your PC or log off Windows and log back in for the change to take effect. 

It does give you an option to set the shorttcut in > > At the bottom of the Customize window choose Insert under and then choose New Page under .

Once you've selected a keyboard shortcut you want click Modify over on the right and your keyboard shortcut will be set. 

Click on the Start typing and you'll see an option come up called . Select that. Make sure the drive you want to turn off defrag/optimize is highlighted and then click on . Uncheck the box that says Click on OK and you're done. 

(assuming you're going to install the equivalent architecture/version of jdk that you installed of jre above) 

I need to monitor the amount of traffic that has passed through a given interface (mobile broadband dongle), so that I am informed when the total reaches (or nears) a given amount. I have practically free mobile broadband up to a not very generous limit, and would like to start a script each time I want to use the dongle, and have it either warn me when it nears my limit, or tell me the total when I quit the script. All I need help on right now is using the right command to record the total transfer in human readable values, i.e. as simple as "You have transferred 12.8Mb since monitoring started". I don't care about speed, utilisation or anything except cumulative total. Once I have a way of calculating the total transfer, I can make happily throw in some ipfw commands to firewall the interface up and prevent further transfer until I say so. I am using Mac OS X 10.7, but want to use standard terminal commands in a bash script (netstat, tcpdump, whatever is preinstalled) and not use a downloaded tool (even if it does the job perfectly - I need it in a script so I can put my own logic around it how I want). 

Background: I am preparing a PC that I am sending to a relative abroad, who has little or no internet access, and next to no sensible options for getting IT support should anything go wrong. As such I am trying to provide a full set of recovery options such that they are able to reinstall the OS with minimum fuss or assistance if required. The PC is a brand new Acer laptop that came with Windows 7 pre-installed (and an associated recovery partition) and a free upgrade to Windows 8. I have installed Windows 8 from scratch performing a format and clean install from media I burned from the official download. The existing Windows 7 recovery partition is still there, and I can still boot from it. I have created recovery DVDs of that in case it is ever lost. Here are my recovery options so far. 

Navigate to folder on your computer. This is where you'll be copying the and files into. Now locate that same folder location in your old Windows folder and grab the and files and copy & replace them into 

Yes, that is exactly what Windows is using in your case. It is a mode called Hybrid Sleep. While it is still possible to setup Windows to go into a strictly sleep or a strictly hibernation mode, by default Windows 10 sleep mode is set as Hybrid Sleep on desktop computers. From thewindowsclub.com article Difference Between Sleep, Hybrid Sleep, Hibernation in Windows 10/8/7 

^^The above setting change will only affect any new files added to your PC going forward. If you want to remove this attribute for the files already on your PC, I'd suggest the following: 

It's not a case of browser/DNS hijacking. What's happening in your case is what is referred to as Typosquatting. From Wikipedia: 

Click on the File tab at the top Choose Options Choose Advanced Go to the General tab Scroll down until you see an option called Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). Currently this box is check. You want to uncheck it. Click OK to get out of that menu and you're done. You will be able to open your Excel file now. 

The following is a guide on how to setup Pyinstaller on a Windows system when, due to firewall restrictions, you are not able to install it using pip... Normally you would just install Pyinstaller with like so: 

The file will be located in a corresponding folder (in your case, the folder name should start with e1i63x64) inside the following directory: 

I just tested this on a Windows XP VM in Virtualbox so it should work for you. Do the following in Internet Explorer 

Had any of the above worked, it might be useful, but as any form of install still requires you to have the DVD, and any form of custom recovery image also requires you to have either a massive stack of DVDs or an NTFS formatted backup device in addition to the recovery drive, it sort of ruins the point. It doesn't seem rocket science. I want to create a bootable USB drive that I can refresh Windows over an existing install with, perform a clean reinstall to a bare system, or recovery a customised image with existing apps installed. If anyone can point me in a direction that allows me to make a single recovery drive do these all these things, I would appreciate it. I have a 32Gb USB3 thumb drive that I bought for this very purpose, but it's seems to be fighting to let me do anything useful. At this rate I will be making a DriveImageXML recovery stick and dumping the OS with that, which I know works, but isn't so elegant as using the proper tools.. 

Now, these recovery options look useful (in principal, although both are fail for me) but they rely on having a working system to access the tools, which leads me to the last option, of making a Recovery USB drive. I have made a recovery drive, and it should perform loads of useful things, including copying my WIN7 recovery partition to the drive, providing the above refresh and reset options, providing other troubleshooting options and also the ability to restore from a custom image, only none of them seem to work for me. 

All of these are useful, but not what I want, because the first 2 methods use Win 7, and still fill the machine with crapware, and the latter doesn't provide for any post-install customisation and software installation. So, I am looking to see what other options are available to perform a Windows 8 recovery that will be more than a simple install. I am aware that Win8 comes with some useful refresh tools: 

After the setup completes you should now have in your folder (which should be either in or , depending on whether you chose "for all users" or "just for this user" during the python install). Before you can use Pyinstaller you'll also need to install . Again, normally the easiest way to install this is to simply run: 

You may or may not, depending on the software that requires the redistributable. Some software is written to rely on a specific redistributable, while another software may be written to rely on that older redistributable but is also able to use any of the more recent versions all the way up to the latest version. From microsoft's forum: 

Edit: If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, you do not have the option to open and will need to make changes to the registry. Do the following: 

Move all the files you would like to remove this attribute from into one folder location. Doesn't matter where. Open Microsoft Word Go to File > Options > Trust Center Click on Trust Center Settings Click on Trusted Locations Click on Add new location Now select the folder where you had moved all your files into Click on OK twice to close out both windows and you're done 

I'm not aware of any way of setting the IPv4 settings for a specific network only as opposed to a specific adapter, but I would suggest another approach for you particular situation. Windows allows you to set an Alternate Configuration for when no DHCP server is found. By default it is set to automatically give you an address in the through range when no DHCP server is found. You can change this default to specifc IPv4 settings of your choosing; in your case, your phone's wireless configuration. To do so, do the following:
