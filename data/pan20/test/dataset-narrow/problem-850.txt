The video isn't working for me. Paste in the last few lines before the bit about "displaying the last 15 lines of the log file", as sometimes that's actually where the problem shows up. The log, unfortunately, can't capture everything on all systems (apt-get doesn't like being run from scripts, and it makes capturing everything, while still providing feedback to the user about what's happening, really difficult, if not impossible). Check the last 100 lines or so of virtualmin-install.log for clues. What Dovecot error, specifically, are you getting? (I wrote the install script. I can usually spot the problem, if I see the actual errors. And, I can also probably fix the problem in future releases, if I understand why it is happening. My last Debian install two days ago worked great, so this is not a known issue.) Edit: OK, so it looks like dovecot isn't installing correctly for some reason. Maybe conflicts with other packages already installed on the system. apt-get is pretty hateful about changing packages to satisfy dependencies. So, try running: apt-get install dovecot-common dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d And see what happens. If it works, then you could try the Virtualm install again. 

This is a mostly client-side question, unfortunately, as there isn't a standard server-side solution to storing address books (though IMAP folders can effectively store arbitrary data, so if everybody agreed on an addressbook format, we could all stick them in IMAP folders). Thunderbird can be configured to share an address book via a variety of methods, including IMAP (using an add-on called synkolab), LDAP (using a variety of sync tools), and shared folders using DAV, FTP, etc. None are particularly standardized, and none are particularly easy to use across multiple mail clients. Usermin currently doesn't support much in the way of shared address books that can easily be used with other clients, though it's been requested a bit over the years. If there were a standard/popular way to store address books in an LDAP directory or in an IMAP folder, I suspect Jamie could be convinced to support it (synkolab might point the way for that, I'm reading up on it now). Usermin does have a system-wide shared address book feature for all Usermin users (which works with the user's individual address book, as well). Getting that out to other mail clients would be tricky. But, in short: The solution you're looking for is not simple. It requires all of the mail clients to agree on how to share their address book. As far as I know, very few of them agree. Thunderbird probably has the widest support for shared address books, however, so that is probably where I'd start. Here's some documentation on the subject: $URL$ Disclosure: I work on Virtualmin, Webmin, and Usermin. 

I'm using a fairly vanilla Ubuntu 10.04 server installation, and I'm experimenting with BTRFS. How can I create a BTRFS RAID1 mount? I've got two (2) 1Gig drives that I popped in the server and after running the following commands, it appears I've got a 2 Gig partition, not 1 Gig as I would expect. 

I've configured to automagically mount a cifs share when users login; the problem is if a user logs into multiple times simultaneously, the mount command is repeated multiple times. This so far isn't a problem but it's messy when you look at the output of a command. 

First, let me state, this was an IT goof up. They deleted an account, went "oops" and created a new account with the same credentials. I can't fathom why. Regardless, I've got a Linux (Ubuntu Server 10.04) box authenticating against an active directory server, and users logging in have local home directories and such. I'm stuck with one user name having a new UID (or SID in AD jargon). Over and above ing his home directory, what other interventions should I do? 

I'm assuming I need to fiddle with either the file or to accomplish this. How can I instruct to avoid duplicate mountings? 

A lot of script simplification would be had if they are. EDIT: I should add these "processes" aren't daemons and don't actually record their PID in the FS anywhere ... 

In Webmin, when you configure a new slave, you will be given the option to copy over all zones on the master to the new slave. The Virtualmin docs have a section about slave DNS servers, and if you're only using Webmin, you'd just skip the end bits about making Virtualmin use the slave server. The steps for Webmin are the same. $URL$ Specifically, the option you want is "Create all existing master zones on slave?" which will copy over all the data. Webmin can also turn the slave into a master in the future, if needed. 

I can't figure out exactly what you're saying Webmin is doing wrong here, but if it's a bug in Webmin you should file a bug in the bug tracker, rather than asking random people at Server Fault how to work around it. Webmin is very actively developed...there's never any reason to work around bugs or incompatibilities in Webmin: Tell someone who can fix it, and it will get fixed fast. You can use the bug tracker at Virtualmin.com or the SourceForge.net one (but the Virtualmin.com tracker is faster, works better, and will get Jamie's attention faster, so I recommend it). 

Webmin is where most security questions would come into play, as it is where logins and such happen. Webmin has a very good security history, and its security record is public: $URL$ It's been several years since the last serious root-level or direct data exposure exploit was discovered, though there have been a few XSS vulnerabilities in the past couple of years. No software of Webmin's complexity will be completely bug-free, including security bugs, but we do take security issues very seriously, and they get fixed quickly. I think Webmin core is about on par with OpenSSH in number and severity of vulnerabilities discovered in the past five years, and I think we all agree that OpenSSH has a really good security record. PCI compliance is entirely possible in a Virtualmin system, as nearly everything related to PCI is provided by the OS (so if your OS is CentOS, then you'd take the same steps you'd take with a non-Virtualmin CentOS system; which isn't all that much). We have hundreds of users who have gone through the PCI compliance process. Note that the PCI scanner is kinda dumb, and will flag the CentOS (or Debian or Ubuntu) standard Apache package as being old and insecure (and since our Apache build is just a rebuild of the OS-provided package with suexec docroot set to /home, ours also gets flagged)...but the OS vendor applies security patches, which correct security issues. So, you have to add an exception for that particular package. This is well-understood by the PCI folks, and you won't have any trouble from them over this; it'd be more dangerous to build Apache from source, get PCI compliance, and then forget that you'd installed from source. We've seen security issues from this kind of thing a lot over the years, so we definitely recommend you stick with standard packages whenever possible, so that normal updates via yum or apt-get will work (and Virtualmin has an updates notification module on the System Information page to let you know when you have updates, if you aren't running them automatically). In short, I believe Virtualmin security is at least as good as the competition, though I'm certain no one has a perfect security record, since the target that the most popular products provide is huge. Webmin, cPanel, and Plesk are all prime targets for black hats because they have root privileges, and run on millions of machines (I know Webmin does, anyway, I'm not sure of the numbers for cPanel or Plesk). And, since jeffatrackaid has gone to the trouble to bring up our competitors forums, I'll mention that Webmin/Virtualmin also has a very active community at $URL$ (and if you like the old school mailing list support process, $URL$ has the hookup). Disclaimer: I'm a developer on Webmin and Virtualmin. 

I have a server that I use infrequently, so I'd like to a job to shutdown daily if no users are logged in via SSH and SAMBA shares. How can I determine how many active SSH connections there are, and how many active SAMBA connections there are? If both of these values are zero, the cron script will shutdown the server. 

Data reliability is the most important issue; power comes next, and I could care less about speed. For the data hardware I've chosen a 3WARE 9650SE-4LPML which will be hosting two (2) TLES enabled WD RE4-GP drives running RAID-1. The decision I'm facing now is what file system should I use? My preference is for something Linux based, and a file system that attempts not only file system integrity but data inegrity as well. Please comment on which file systems, OS distributions and for that matter hardware chosen that you think may best fit my requirements. 

I'm putting together an file server which will have a very limited number of users (less than 5) and offer the following services: 

The next time I logged and tried to create a user, the default domain was still there. How can I change default doamin in an OTRS installation? 

I've got a number of Windows (7/Vista/XP) based machines on a network that have no unifying structure (i.e. no ADC, PDC or for that matter a workgroup). I recently added a Linux box with a fairly sizable raid setup that I'd like to use as a file server. What would be considered a best practice for making the storage on the Linux box available to the windows clients on the network? It seems my options are: 

I have been doing an audit of my SQL Server log, as I 'thought' it was locked down but appeared to be open and we were getting a lot of password attempts on the SA account. After sorting that, I have noticed throughout the day in the ErrorLog I have entries like this 

For all the databases on the server. Its doing this more or less every hour? Is that right? I assumed once the database had started thats it unless I restart the SQL service or shut down the server? Any advice appreciated - Thanks. 

So I'm a little taken back by this. I have gone through all the sites and cannot see anything that would indicate a site has been compromised, or that anyone has compromised the server? Could this be just a mistake or someone has masked their own IP address and used my servers? Any other ideas or tools that I could use to investigate this further to see if there has been a compromise? Any help appreciated. Thanks. 

But I'd like to know what else people do for precaution, for example can you backup the entire IIS and all its settings? As re-creating all the sites and application pools etc... would be a real time consuming pain if the worst were to happen? Any tips / advice greatly appreciated 

I used a turnkeylinux.org otrs installation and I'm trying to configure the default domain of 'yourhost.example.com'. I tried the following: 

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and have the directory setup as a BTRFS RAID 1 with two 2TB drives. I'd like to make the directory just a single drive; how do I safely go about doing this? 

I've got VMWare ESXi (the free version) machine that is booting off a 9650SE RAID-1 drive setup (two 1TB mirrored drives). I'd like to replace the 1TBs with 2TBs. Is there a safe way to do this? 

The is actually a script function that checks the status code and calls exit if necessary, nonetheless, How is the above any different than this: 

I need to install an older version of gcc on Ubuntu 10.04 (Beta 2); and I'm told I can install a previous package. At present, I can't compile version gcc-3.3.x, and I'm looking to install a package. How do I instruct to pull stuff from previous Ubuntu archives? 

With the value set to true, the module was trying to remove from the system, not, as I assumed, in the directory. 

I'm looking at some scripts, and a number of them use this what is essentially this command in their "" target: 

I'm testing a backup to a bare metal restore. The new hardware doesn't have PS2 Mice/Keyboard and needs USB drivers: I can't log into any of the Safe Modes. I can however, put the original SBS2003 install disks in the machine and jump into Recovery Console. How do I go about installing board Chip Set drivers and USB drivers? Is it a simple copy? If so, what to where?
