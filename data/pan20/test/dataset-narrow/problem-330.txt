I've recently installed Fedora 19 on an older PC, to serve as a test server of sorts. After a lot of hiccups, I was able to install Oracle 10g XE. Because I'm using Linux - which I, admittedly, have little experience of - I used the command line (rpm) to install the file. Everything proceeded without a hitch, though I didn't understand much of it. When I try to log in using sqlplus, though, the command line returns: 

In theory, the data model allows for phones to be related to more than one patient. We did have some issues in the past, and most of the phone numbers have been denormalized. I need help to understand: 

The relationship: Patient to PatientPhone - 1 to Many Phone to PatientPhone - 1 to Many In order to validate before and after, I have been using this query to sample the phone numbers by grouping the first couple of digits. It gives me a wide distribution of values, as I would expect: 

I'm supposed to migrate a MySQL database into IBM DB2, but I thought I'd take baby steps first before I do something like that. So for now, I'd just like to add a database. I'll admit that I have no experience at all with IBM DB2. Here's what I did so far: 

I don't know who this ELF guy is, but at this point, I assumed I'm screwed. After more research on the internet, I found out something about Oracle variables and paths not setting themselves correctly, but none of them were of any help. sqlplus: command not found Go To Oracle Home Any ideas? Thanks. Additional Info: 

Is it possible in the foreign key definition to restrict the categories that can be referenced based on another column in the table? For example, say there is a column in the table. I'd like the foreign key constraint to be restricted to those categories where . 

Then, when doing a search using FREETEXT or FREETEXTTABLE, once again use the "LANGUAGE" argument. Microsoft defines the "LANGUAGE" argument as follows: 

So, I will use one catalog and one index on the multi-lingual table using a neutral language resource. Then I'll use the appropriate language setting when searching so everything is parsed correctly. 

PowerBI Integration is not enabled on either of the 2016 servers, and is obviously not a part of the existing 2008 R2 configuration. I do not wish to use this feature. How do I solve this problem and begin to create subscriptions, so I can ultimately migrate all of the reports? 

I would tend to believe the data (phones being shared) is likely the cause of this problem, but I am having trouble proving that. Can someone help me with this? Thanks for your time. 

Can I have some help on this? Where do I go from here, and how do I create a database? EDIT: I added a Port Number (12345), which then allowed me to create a database, albeit with an error: 

Take note that being a Linux noob, I actually have no idea if this command holds true to every Linux installation. All I know is that it works on my friend's PC. My PC, on the other hand, produces some interesting results: 

Thousands of records I did NOT want to update were updated. Many of the other groups of Patients were NOT updated. 

My understanding of SQL security is such that in order to have access to the server, you need a login. To access a database on that server, your login needs to be associated with a user in that database. Over time I have been consolidating security so that developers, QA, etc. are in various roles implemented as active directory groups. Those groups have logins on the server, so individual windows logins are not so prevalent on SQL instances. I grant proper accesses to the databases through these roles. A common service I provide is to refresh non-production versions of databases from production. I'll do a backup and restore of a production database onto a development server, de-identify the data, rename it, etc. I have noticed something recently in my environment that is troubling. I was granting access to a key table in production for a development team, when I noticed by using 'fn_my_permissions' that one of the developers has read and write access to the entire production database, rather than being restricted to read-only as I designed. I compared all of this developer's group memberships and found another group he was a member in that was assigned read/write - but only as a database user. There is no associated login for that group on that SQL server. It is typical here to copy a 'baseline' production database and repurpose it elsewhere - whether as another production database, or a non-production version. I am starting to find other examples of this anomaly. To sum it up, the problem I see is that when a database is copied to another server, the users in that database that were previously linked to logins on the original SQL instance seem to retain the same level of access on the new SQL instance - even if there is no related login for them on new SQL instance! This strange effect seems limited to users representing windows group logins. Here is a summary of what I am seeing: Server1 has a login tied to windows group A, which has been granted read/write to database X. Database X is then backed up and restored onto Server2, with logins but none related to group A. The database still shows a user for group A, and when I run 'fn_my_permissions' for a user in that group he has read/write to the database. This particular server is running SQL Enterprise 2012 SP3 with the latest CU. I've seen the same thing on servers running 2008 R2, as well as a current build of SQL 2016. Why is this happening? And what can I do to ensure that users do not inadvertently circumvent the controls I have put in place? It seems obvious I need to remove all of the unnecessary users after the databases are copied, but why? 

Now, I did some digging around. First thing I did was to check if the server is up and running. So I entered the following: 

I'm currently using MySQL version 5.0.16, on my local computer (which runs a 32-bit OS), for easier access while developing my program. Now that I'm ready to deploy my program, I'd like to test the connection over a network, and use a 64-bit server to hold the database. Up til now, I've only used the 32-bit version, and my backup 'process' would be to copy the database folder from C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\data and paste it onto the same directory of another computer. I'm not sure if that would work. I tried using both MySQL Query Browser and Command Line Client to do the following: mysqldump -u root -proot Isys-TMS(EEI1) > isystms.sql; But both simply return this error: "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'mysqldump -u root -proot Isys-TMS(EEI1) > isystms.sql' at line 1" Which is not at all helpful. (Though I'm not sure if I did it right on the command line client, as opposed to Windows' own CMD) I'm also assuming I can simply use this .sql output on the new 64-bit MySQL, so if that's not the case, what else can I do to solve this problem? Thanks. Notes: 

I am planning a migration to 2016 Reporting Services and have noticed a particular problem. On two separate new installs for SSRS 2016 Developer Edition, I am unable to save a subscription to a report. The report was downloaded as RDL from the current 2008 R2 server, then saved to the new 2016 environment. The new server is build 13.0.4466.4. I also installed the same version of SQL onto a second server and have reproduced this problem. All servers are running in Native Mode. Within Report Manager, I am able to view the contents of the report (on-demand). When I try to create a subscription, the web page is stuck with the "Loading...." prompt after I click 'Create subscription'. It does this regardless of the Render Format I choose. I am attempting to deliver via e-mail. I have domain credentials for the SSRS service account configured, and I have put the IP address for the SMTP server in RS Configuration Manager, so I know it is configured for email ok. In the SSRS log file, I see these types of errors at the time I try to create the subscription: 

I would like to implement full-text search on the article title and body. The complication is that the title and body can be in one of six languages, indicated by the "lang" column. I see there are noise word files for several languages, so depending on the currently set language, I would like to use the appropriate noise file when searching. Does this require one catalog per language? If separate catalogs are used, is it possible to, for example, not include French articles in the English catalog? 

Thanks to the suggestions from others, and I appreciate the time anyone took reading this post. So after looking at this different ways, and taking several breaks, I now see that my validation query was at fault. The join was incorrect. The Update statement was designed correctly, I verified the data was valid in the tables, the relationships correct, and I was able to verify at a detailed level the update worked. Something about my validation query (that did aggregations) seemed off. My validation was incorrectly joining against the wrong foreign key. The join:
