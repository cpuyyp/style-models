So I thought I knew how to set up my DHCP Server on my 3550 switch and reserve IP's for clients. I go into the pool I need to reserve the IP in, but I do not have the address command as an option to do it like I have in the past on IOS. 

I have a ws-C2960XR-24ps-I switch with 2 slots for power supply's but only 1 power supply inserted. So the switch is always logging an event : "%PLATFORM_ENV-1-FRU_PS_ACCESS: FRU Power Supply is not responding". When I try to disable it by running I get "power supply is not present" in response. Is there a way to disable that slot so it stops sending these log messages that there is a missing power supply? 

A printer was sent out to a location with a static IP from its previous location. Printer 123 was on subnet 192.168.5.0/24 in Branch A with a static IP of 192.168.5.5. Printer 123 was sent to branch B with a different network 172.16.4.0/24, BUT the static IP from branch A was never removed from Printer 123. Now it is sitting in Branch B with a static IP from its old network. How can I access the web interface to change it to DHCP? Proposed solution: If I place the switch port that the printer is connected to on its own vlan and place the vlan IP on its same network but a 192.168.5.0/30 (4 IP's 2 usable)just enough to cover the printer's static IP so it can be accessed, would that cause any issues with the routing tables? There is already a route that points traffic to 192.168.5.0/24 out a particular interface. The majority of the traffic (95%) from this branch forwards to branch A. Would my solution work? is there an easier way? Apparently restoring to default does not work, then again I do not have an IT guy out there to ensure it actually is being restored to default settings. 

I'm not aware of what Red5 in particular is/how it uses the bandwidth, but with voice and videoconferencing, bandwidth itself is just half of the story. You need to check for jitter and delay, which are critical for that kind of applications. If jitter is high, you'll experience what you're describing: "choppy". If you have Cisco routers at customer, you can use IP SLA[1] to test for video/voice, along with very detailed analysis of performance data. Measuring bandwidth is not enough. [1]. $URL$ 

You can ask Your partner for CTMP, and get better pricing (deeper discount) for 5585-X in exchange for your 5555-X. The other option (as clustering doesn't support remote VPNs) is to have some load-balancer in front of set of ASAs doing the hard job of splitting the load. 

What is the operating system you're testing this on? If it's Windows, by default there's "QoS Packet Scheduler" service installed and binded to the networking interface. It will kick in depending on the underlying settings of the network stack and proactively delay any traffic that is not classified as "multimedia". Try to delete it from the interface and recheck your results. Or better yet, reconfigure it properly: $URL$ 

In essence, RIB (Routing Information Base) is being built by various routing processes on the node, with information from routing protocols - like OSPF, IS-IS, BGP or even the static entries. After out of all routes in RIB the best ones are selected, they are copied to FIB (Forwarding Information Base). The exact means vary from platform to platform. In general, it's either done by some IPC communication, internal network, or simply (in monolitic software solutions) as a copy (data or pointers) between tables. So, RIB contains all the routes node is willing to keep and the information there is being used by the routing protocols. FIB is used by hardware to physically move the packets in and out of interfaces. Hardware can keep forwarding based on the FIB contents, while RIB is being updated/etc. Take a look here for starters: $URL$ and then - for example - dig deeper into $URL$ for more detailed RIB/FIB/LFIB illustration. Also, '' sounds a little rude. It's community portal, if you something maybe you should look for commercial ways of gaining this knowledge. 

You probably will want to look into port-security sticky (dynamically learns the MAC) then configure aging to age out old MAC Addresses on each interface. You wont be able to have port security configured and at the same time allow a MAC to move from interface to interface without problems. As stated above, it defeats the purpose of port-security. For each interface you can configure it to dynamically learn the mac with: 

EDITED: ADDED FULL ROUTER CONFIG I have a cisco 2921. It uses EIGRP to learn its routing table and has no static default routes set up. I would like to keep it that way. The default route (learned from EIGRP) is another device on my network across a Metro ENS link. When this particular router receives traffic from host 192.168.2.5 I want it to be given a default route out this routers ISP connection (3.3.3.1). It is not working, does anyone know why this route map does not work? The traffic from my host arrives at Interface GigabitEthernet0/1. I want it to go out Interface GigabitEthernet0/0 using the ISP ( the IP in the route-map is the default gateway my ISP has provided). Interface gi0/0 also has a vpn tunnel configured to my main site, its more of a backup link but I do not see this as being a problem (or is it?). I have verified that the access list on interface gig0/0 is not blocking any traffic for this host. I ran and and nothing comes up. This tells me that whenever I try to access this device from the internet it is not hitting interface gi0/1 at all. I can see the traffic hitting gig0/0, but never gig0/1. Perhaps I have a NAT issue? 

I just want the specific log to stop without keeping it from logging any issues with the slot that is in use. 

Does anyone know what license is required on a Cisco 2921 router to use Policy Based routing? Here is my show version output: 

You can take a look at the CVDs for Mobility: $URL$ I wouldn't put 200 people on one AP. Try to keep the number low (~30 maximum), and in general with different use charateristics of various WLAN clients, you should get good performance. 

Testing that kind of features using GNS3 is simply waste of time. You're emulating at run-time complex software, and on top of that, you're adding complex features. There's no sense in 'trying' 7200 as 7200 are long EoS: $URL$ Download CSR 1000v and test in on some decent hypervisor, you may get better luck, but on IOS-XE you'll have different configuration templates. 

On a general note: not everything that is present in parser, will actually work on given platform, or even makes sense. In that particular case, you can enable spanning tree if you have either IRB (integrated routing & bridging) configured on ethernet ports, or you insert the integrated switching module (WIC-4ESW) into the router. Then, those ports are L2 by default and actually it makes sense to run STP on them to avoid loops. 

There are a couple of things not readily clear. First of all, in the 'update' session, you're noting some changes - please post complete, current config. Next, policy-maps work at INPUT, not at output. In other words, on your outside interface (fa0/1) you're trying to match for incoming traffic, which doesn't make any sense - the private IPs are coming in from internal network, so you should attach the route-map to internal interface. The next part which isn't clear is what's the VPN for - is it only for WWW traffic, or for all traffic matched by ACL 154 that defines traffic interesting for crypto as being all IP from 192.168.30.0/24 to 192.168.10.0/24? Decide, then configure. To clear this mess up, I'd setup a Tunnel0 vpn interface that will separate routing from interface configuration and work in this mode, here's example of that kind of conifg: $URL$ 

No, the line would be then 24x1.5Mbit/s, not 1.5Mbit/s. The whole idea of TDM is that you take a line, clocked appropriately (for T1 it's usually Stratum 3 class clock), to fit a defined number of DS0 channels. Your specific service can get one DS0 (64kbit/s), two (128kbit/s), three (192kbit/s) - and up to full bandwidth of the link (1.5Mbit/s). Think about it this way: each second, 1.5Mbit is sent over the link according to clocking of the line. Depending on how many channels (DS0's) you were allocated in your service specification, you'll be able to send that much of bits over the link. BTW, in Europe we use E1's, that have 30 channels, each at 64kbit/s for 2Mbit/s, but again, the service can get anything from one channel up to full set of channels - to the level of 2Mbit/s. 

Here is my question/confusion. On the HQ WAN side I have a 30mbps pipe available, on each branch WAN side I have a 10mbps pipe. What would be the best way to QOS this traffic? I would like to focus on outbound traffic from each site. Im thinking that on each branch WAN egress I can use srr-queue bandwidth limit XX as well as on the egress of the HQ WAN link. This would set a limit on the available bandwidth. However, since the 3750 & 3650 do not support policy-maps on the outbound traffic, I am not sure if my only option is to used srr shape and share and add dscp values (which would be classified & marked with respective ACLs, Class Maps) to each queue set. Then set my bandwidth and buffers for the thresholds. I tried by configuring policy maps on the input but the results were not what I expected. I also could not understand the point of limiting input traffic since it has already arrived. 

I used ip default next-hop because I want it to look at the routing table first (for internal communications to DNS, AD, local access) and then as a last resort use this route to get out to the internet. For testing, i add a static route 0.0.0.0/0 ab.ac.ab.ax and everything works great. But i do not want any of my other devices that send traffic through this router to know there is a way out to the internet. I only want this specific host to be able to use this local ISP link. This is why i am using PBR. Everything else that hits this router will go out the configured vpn tunnel on gi0/0 to another location. 

I have an ASA I set up for a non profit org which is not passing traffic. Packet tracer gives me mixed results depending on where the traffic is coming from, the two results are that the traffic is being dropped by an ACL and the other that it is a NAT issue. Im sure its something obvious that im missing. I can get to certain sites like youtube and google drive but not others such as dropbox or gmail. They stream live to youtube without issues as well. Im inclining towards it being a problem with traffic getting back in from the outside interface to the inside interface. Here is the current config. 

Well, every link transmits only either 0 or 1 at any specific moment. So if your router connected to 2Mbit/s link receives first 250 bytes packet, and assuming that it doesn't have anything at the moment to send, it will pass the 250 bytes into the interface driver, and then serialize it (meaning put 0s and 1s) onto a link. The next packet, even if it's just milisecond later, will wait for the first packet to be transmitted. This may incur delay in sending (alone) of 1 milisecond, but that's just theory - in reality, there will be some additional, minimal delay depending on the way your router works. Take a look here for additional writeup. There are techniques to fight with serialization delay (take a look here), but in todays networks and with your 2Mbit/s link, you may find them unnecessary. You shouldn't have to use them, as even with 1500 bytes segments, with proper priority queue implementation, this link shouldn't incur delay that's visible for typical IP-based applications. 

You may also find Wireshark, an GUI tool built on tcpdump fundamentals a good resource to use in daily work and as a base reference for protocol decoding. Answering your specific question: why you're trying to monitor multicast on this specific node? If you want to monitor multicast in core of the network, you should SPAN/RSPAN your traffic to this host and then sniff it using favorite tool - be it tcpdump. If that's a switched network you're connected to, you'll see few if any multicast packets - your station doesn't have (by default) means to become active destination of all multicast traffic unless it registers to be it (and that requires additional work, besides running sniffer alone). 

The description is misleading, and it's something we need to fix/standarize (I'm with Cisco, will reach out to doc guys to fix it). In reality: 

FabricPath transports Ethernet frames. Take a look here for frame format: $URL$ If your device/software package is to work between two FP switches, mind you it's not supported today. Also, make no assumptions with regards to what will protocol do or don't do - put a lot of effort in checking if the thing you received matches your expectations and only then act/call some functions. And yes, VLAN tags are carried through the FP domain if the original traffic was tagged. 

Ok I believe I found the problem. My remote sites have their own routers with their own internet connection. We don,t really use it for anything other than an IPSEC tunnel back to HQ to use as a backup WAN link.. I use EIGRP to build my route tables, so these routers at my remote sites happen to not have a static default route. So anytime their public IP is pinged, scanned, and so forth, the replies are going out using the default route learned by EIGRP, which goes over our WAN line to my CORE switch then out to the internet through my ASA firewall. As soon as I add a static default route at each remote site the problem, so far, goes away. 

Like Ron says in his response, you will want to have port-security to dynamically learn (sticky) the MAC addresses, possible set a max amount to learn on each interface, and configure the aging parameters to what best suits you. 

I have a Cisco ASA that gives me some sylogs that I do not understand. My INSIDE interface is where all my private IP addresses reside for the enterprise i work for. My OUTSIDE interface is what has my public IP address block assigned to it. I often see the following logs which I do not understand, a routable IP address is being sourced on the INSIDE interface with a destination to another routable public IP on the OUTSIDE interface. Any ideas? None of the IP addresses on these logs belong to me or are assign to any of my devices. 

Okay so this is one of those times when you should always verify your network map even if you are pretty confident it is correct. The jack on the wall at my desk that I was connecting the switch to was passing through an old Dell switch hidden away on a rack. The Dell switch was only passing untagged traffic so this is the reason Span tree was not working. This is why when I would run my debugs on both ends I could see the BPDU's leaving each switch but neither Cisco switch would recieve any BPDU's from each other. As soon as I ripped that old dell out of the server room and threw it away, everything works. I suppose this is why we have an OSI model for troubleshooting, always start at layer 1 and always verify even if someone swears the network map is correct.
