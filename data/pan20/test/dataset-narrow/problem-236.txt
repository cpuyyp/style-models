But if I want to find "how many times the user using the player Lizard has won, lost and draw" then I need to run the following queries: 

I have a table called where I have a default record "always". Since I'm testing all the time and sometimes I need to clean that table I'm asking if there is any way to run the following query any time I run the TRUNCATE command on the table: 

How, if it's possible, using NOT IN I can know which is on table and which not? In this case fps.id aren't in can be deleted the existent not. Any advice or any other way to achieve this? This is the model (just for info purposes) Doing some tests: Based on the answer by the user I modified a bit the original query and comes with this: 

Why is that? I have others triggers created on the same way and them did works but this one doesn't, any advice or help regarding this? 

So this will be the dummy question of the year but I need to ask since is not the first time I pass through this. Take a look to the following table definition: 

And I need to get those devices with no driver assigned, in other words the device returned on this query shouldn't be on table since it'll not have driver assigned, can any give me some help on this query? 

I could do this by using programming but I want to know and learn, if this is possible, to do it through SQL. I need, foreach row, on perform an UPDATE on but just when , how? I must clear that should be updated to if a UPDATE was runned on it. This is what I did so far: 

I've a dilemma in my application and I don't get how to solve it at DB level. The idea is that a user can be subscribed to one or more services but services are show depending on user type. This can sound tricky but it does not. So I have a form where I pick which type of user I'm registering but then from services table I need to show only the services allowed for that type of user. I made this table: 

Let's said I am managed to create a lot of and records but I need to create the relationship between them. I can do this programmatically but I don't want to waste time on that if I can do in someway using MySQL functions or any other way. So, any advice, code example, query example? 

I need to set only one possible combination of the columns message_id, owner_user_id, to_user_id meaning the combination (for example) 1,1,1 only can exists one time so no duplicates is allowed. How I do this? Creating an index between them? Cheers and thanks in advance 

I'm trying to get non equal or repeat results from default_tb_persona using a JOIN sentence, this is what I've made for that: 

Take a look at the column which is a right now but it will hold a phone number. Since I don't know how many numbers a phone could have all over the world then I am trying to cover almost all of them. I want to keep database integrity as much as possible so I think is not a proper type for hold this kind of information - maybe I am wrong, you tell me - so I am thinking in change to or even . When I am defining a column in Workbench I should specify the number between parentheses not in all the cases but in those I mention previous I had to. So if I do this: I got this error: 

But I'm getting repeated results. Is that query right? If I have two records pointing to the same record on tb_persona should the query return those two records? I've a test data if any can help me, just say me where to send and I will to solve this problem. Also it's possible to get only fields from default_tb_persona and not from both tables? 

Between and tables exists the same relation twice: is a FK on and also is a FK and both points to maybe here is the problem and I don't see it yet. Anyway, I leave the SQL schema in this link because is a bit large, apologies for that but and I provide the same data I've for testing purpose. What I'm doing wrong? PS: You can take a look to data on this images I leave and as I said data is shared 

is stored as a so this is where the problem is I though. How do get that rows in this case? Any help? This are some of the values on that column to play with: 

I am working in a DB diagram and I have a table called . Each record of this table can have or not a downloadable file (saved a file path). I have identified two possibles ways to achieve this. 

The query above guarantee to me just on reps to one territory as should be. How I should modify the trigger to accomplish this? NOTE: is a function I have for normalize strings 

But I don't know where to go from here and also doesn't know if what I want to achieve is possible at all. Any advice? work around? solutions? 

But as I said before I want to run the same query in the 3 databases at the same time and not get repeated results? Any help? There are a few tables included on the query as you may notice but think that 3 databases are exactly the same and can share different or the same data in some cases so use or don't the tables as reference on your answer. DB's are running on the same server and share the same credentials 

Can any give me some feedback and|or help on this? is the PK on and is the FK (kind of since that DB has not real relationships) on . 

This should return any record from default_cmvblog where title, content or keywords is like 86a7 and also status is live, right? The same for default_users should return records where email or username like 86a7 and id != 1 and active = 1, right? But I get 0 as the COUNT why? What's wrong in my query? Cheers and thanks in advance 

So, I have this relations on my tables (see image) and I need to understand some things. I'll enumerate what I understand and what I need from yours is to say if I'm right or not and in case I'm not give me the good answer. If is FK on and tables if I set onUpdate and onDelete to what this mean? 1- When I delete a the cascade will delete all the records on and tables? 2- When I delete a what happen with the that points to that person? In order to maintain a good table structure, data consistency and integrity, what are you're suggestions regarding this topic? 

I don't know if the column has to be the first one on the table definition and if there is anyway to let it be wherever I want to or the solution maybe would be import the data by skipping the column (supposing it's the first one). I was checking the syntax here but I don't have a clue in how to skip a column during load: 

I have 3 tables in 3 different databases which are exactly the same. I'm trying to sync from this 3 databases to a master database as shown in the picture below: 

So, how do I apply my query to the trigger in order to get right results? Can any give me some help? 

Can I pass an array as value or I need to iterate for the values and execute the query several times? 

Each time I try to INSERT a new record I get an error due to constraints, that is OK, now if I try to UPDATE the same record and I leave and/or or any other required field empty the UPDATE is executed and the column is set to blank, why? How I can avoid this? I am using MariaDB 5.5.46. UPDATE As requested by moderator below is the INSERT and UPDATE queries I have tried: 

As you can see is simple and hasn't no constraints which relies on duplicate and wrong values. The problem happen exactly on where a is assigned to one or more . In the new DB that is not allowed so I need to find - from - those reps that has only one and I got that through this query: 

I have a database containing three tables: tbl_database (main table is the primary), tbl_cmdatabase and tbl_blacklist. The three tables share the same structure but differ in the number of records that can be. This is the SQL structure, that basically is the same: 

I need to change the names on PK columns and that has relations with another tables meaning they are FK also so this is what I am doing:
