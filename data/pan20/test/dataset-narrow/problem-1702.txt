The commands above need to run one after the other in that order. (Don't start the next one running until the one before it has finished). There are lots of different options during the installation process. For more information on those see here. The software is set continuously running, if the following command is executed: 

If you think the SD card slot is damaged, then you can attempt a repair (not recommended), or return the Pi to the seller for a new one. The number of times the LED blinks is indicative as to what the problem could be: 

The manufacture of Raspberry Pi's as far as I am aware is by Element14/Premier Farnell. Originally they were made in China but are now produced in the UK, which is fitting, given the Foundation is a British organisation. You can read more about that here. In terms of a Pi made for commercial use Element14 have an exclusive Raspberry Pi customization area. This would allow you to order customized Pi's in bulk orders. I've not really looked into this too much as I haven't had the need to bulk order Pi's. If you contact Element14 with your request they might be able to find a solution for you. You might also be interested in the Compute Module, which fits in a DDR2 SODIMM connector. This is aimed at people looking to produce custom PCBs. You could probably bulk order them and try to find an electronics company to build a board with your required components. As to another device with extensive customization support, well that really would depend on your needs. It's also a question that wouldn't be on-topic here as it's not related to the Pi and is more of a business operations question anyway. 

I have an embedded zero I'd like to power from a battery pack with 4 AAs. I know I can connect the leads the the GPIO as well as cutting apart a cable to plug in but I am wondering if I could solder them to the pads underneath the power plug. These ones: (pp5 and pp2) 

I have been experimenting with the Bluetooth capability's of the pi and i came across two commands and . When i run i get: 

I recently went on a trip with my RPi several hundred miles from were i live and i was surprised to see that when i ran then it still showed devices from my house 

This is some fairly simple code that gets the temperature from in thousandths Celsius divides by 1000 for Celsius and checks if it is more than 45. if it is it turns the "fan" on and if not , it stays off. But you'll almost certainly never need a fan as long as you're not doing anything stupid. This code was adapted from a SE question but i am not sure which. 

I don't own a camera but the way to enable it is to run then go down to option 6 and select yes and I believe that this should enable it. 

I very strongly recommend the Pi Hut's Raspberry Pi Power supply. I use it myself and it powers a Pi 3 running at 100% CPU usage with USB devices connected, absolutely no problem. It is specifically designed for powering the Pi, so it is your best bet. Nevertheless you can get away with something like a high quality tablet charger, as it will be able to supply the current. 

Its a problem at the Pi end, it might be there is not enough bandwidth for 2 Bluetooth devices. I expect the keyboard will work with the trackpad disconnected. 

To load the new version of the PiX GTK theme. (Note the . in front of themes) run `` To prevent the ClipIt application from automatically starting on boot run To prevent the Wicd network manager from automatically starting on boot run To remove the huge list of application shortcuts in the “Other” menu run To select to boot to desktop with autologin as the pi user run To hide the menu shortcut to the Openbox window manager, whose functionality has been replaced by the Appearance Settings preferences application run 

It installs a GUI interface among other things which allows you to control the Bluetooth module. The software is located under menu, preferences then Bluetooth adapter. If you still can't get it to work I suggest returning it and looking through the list of compatible Bluetooth adapters. 

I was installing and removing packages recently and i noticed that it said: as soon as i ran the command. But, when i ran it still said: When i ran however it also said: 

what is the difference between these two and what do they mean? I have searched for "action 17 on raspbian" and other things like that but found no helpful results. 

I've been getting into GPIO recently with the GPIOZero library but when i first tried it today it completely failed. As my first foray into GPIO i set up a circuit to light up an LED with the push of a button, so simple nothing could go wrong, right? I imported the library like so: then i set up my components: then the button: And then this happened: 

SSh is disabled by default on all new raspbian installs. To enable it you will either need to physically log in and enable it with or insert your sd card into another computer and create a file called with no filename extension to enable it on the boot partition. Then make sure it's connected to WI-FI and try again. 

I ended up just restarting cron and it worked fine. Not sure why this worked when restarting the whole thing didn't but there we go. Thanks for the heads up Goldilocks! cheers wayne 

I am having trouble using a cron job in Raspbian Jessie to run a bash script that works fine when I run it manually on the command line. I have read a few responses but the advice doesn't help,,, or maybe I am being dim! Here's what I did: Created a bash script: 

Also confirmed that the executable permissions worked by looking at the file properties. Using gnome-schedule I created a cron job 

You can move it to your Documents folder in the File Manager or you can use MV on a command line. Hope this helps! cheers wayjo 

Once you have followed Dmitry's advice regarding DNS, if you still have an issue... Check your etc/hosts file to see if you have domains pointed at 10.0.0.1. Unlikely but worth looking. or Ping google.com to see if you are getting out there 

This might not be exactly what you are looking for but the only guide I could find that worked perfectly when I was setting up an RTC was the one at Adafruit. Try searching for Adding a Real Time Clock to Raspberry Pi - Adafruit pdf 

looking at the product pictures for the touchscreen it needs to be plugged into the display port on the Pi with a ribbon cable as shown. You then need to connect the appropriate GPIO cables. Next enter these commands into the LXTerminal: 

Depending on the hard disk drive you are using and the USB stick you want use the chances are performance wise there isn't going to be much difference. Depending on the model of Pi you have, the USB ports and the Ethernet port share the same controller. This means the USB transfer rate is bottle-necked by any traffic through the Ethernet port. Also worth considering is all models of the Pi use USB 2.0 connectors. At best through a USB 2.0 connection, (theoretically), you are going to get a connection speed of 53MB/s. (See this post for more details). Generally speaking a modern 7200RPM drive is at best going to give read speeds of around 160MB/s and write speeds of around 150MB/s. Again that's a best case scenario, so you should expect less. The read and write speeds of the USB drive depends on the type of flash memory that is used in it. A cheap flash drive is obviously going to perform worse in read and write tests. However flash memory can perform on par or better than a HDD. Although you will pay a premium for uber fast flash drives. To be honest I don't think you will notice a difference between the two. The only thing I would add is if you fill the USB flash drive to capacity it will start to slow down. You are going to be less likely to run into that issue with the 1TB drive. I can't imagine any lifespan differences would cause you issues. And I'm not sure I could argue one drive is more reliable than the other. If you would like a detailed comparison in this area I suggest you give this page a look. 

I am looking to get the output of thermal_zone0 (CPU temp) to display on my Sense-Hat. I now know how to print the temp thanks to @Joan but when i try the code below but i got 

I have attempted to re download the library but said that it was the latest version. This is the circuit: 

As you can see this shows the website it is from from which you should be able to tell who it's from. 

Theoretically this should speed it up to whatever time you set as n. For a better option you should have it be multi-threaded so that you can have them happen at the same time with no delay if you'd like to try that i recommend you here. 

If you are looking to install something nicer I would recommend Iceweasel which you can install by simply running But if you want only things already on Raspbian there are 3 web browsers that come with Raspbian netsurf: which you can use by using the command dillo: which you can run with and Epiphany: which you can run with 

It is possible but extremely unlikely that they have the exact same device list as i have at home but, as i don't think they do what would cause this behavior? Top picture is there bottom is at my house. 

There's a possibility overscan might be enabled so going into raspi-config and disable it. If you look in the config.txt file on the SD card you should find some lines of code that look like this: 

For more information on this you can check out the official documentation. Quick side note: There isn't any officially endorsed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation webcams as far as I am aware. Although you might be interested in the Raspberry Pi Camera module which connects via a ribbon cable to the camera connector on the Pi. This is a product that was released by the Foundation. 

It might be worth uncommenting the left or right line by removing the hashtag, so you would end up with this instead, for example: 

You are certainly not the first person to have asked about using a cooling fan with the Pi. I can understand why people think they need to actively cool their Pi. From a desktop PC user's perspective the idea of running a CPU without any cooling seems bonkers. I have extensively used various models of Pi over the past couple of years and not once I have been concerned about the Pi overheating. Firstly, the SoC which is the main chip on the board, where things like the CPU are located has a thermal limit of 85°C. This means if the Pi approaches this temperature it reduces the performance and the temperature decreases. Having used a Pi 3 in applications such as a media center, not even watching a film at 1080p could get the CPU temperature anywhere near that. Also a cooling fan is rather redundant anyway unless you plan to use heat sinks. Heat sinks allow the thermal energy to be stored up over a large surface area. This makes dissipating the heat energy far more effective than just blowing some air on the SoC. I've had a look at the case you are referring to and I'm struggling to imagine fitting even a tiny cooling fan in it. Yes you could solder it to the GPIO pads on the underside of the Pi, do I recommend it, well... It's one of those were if you have to ask it might not be a good idea. You do risk bricking your Pi in the process and I imagine you are going to void any warranties in the process. I'm also not sure if the GPIO is going to be to handle both the requirements of the case and the fan simultaneously. I suggest if you are concerned about temperatures to keep an eye on them, if they are not going anywhere near 85°C then the cooling fan is really superfluous. 

Just use win32diskimager to "read" instead of write. This creates a .img file of your configured OS which you can copy to other SD cards. 

Although running the script manually works fine the cron job fails. I tried variants of the command line in the cron job: 

Would appreciate any guidance, pointing or even laughter behind my back as long as it helps :-) Many thanks in advance! cheers wayjo 

I don't believe there are any touch screens with a 7/2 ratio. The nearest would be something like 3/2 but the only one of those I have seen is actually 60mm high without any trim. 

You might need to use the actual IP address if your local DNS is not sufficient. You can find this by logging in to the admin section of your router(broadband maybe) and view connected devices. This is your DHCP server. If you do not have access to the the DHCP server you can open a command line and use . This uses the Address Resolution Protocol. You may be able to identify the correct IP from the resulting list. 

You would only be using bandwidth if a client was receiving a stream. If you don't want to use bandwidth don't have a client downloading. It should be just sitting there waiting otherwise.
