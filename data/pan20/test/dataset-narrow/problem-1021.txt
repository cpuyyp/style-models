I personally like to make sure that my dual monitors are running the same resolution. Changing focus between monitors with different resolutions, particularly anything with text that then resizes, used to cause me headaches after extended periods of use. In terms of software, I always go for UltraMon. 

I used to see this behaviour a lot too. For me I believe it was because I was I/O bound on my system drive. I moved the .mdfs and .ldfs off my system drive onto a secondary drive and this stopped the machine freezing up during restores. 

Syncplicity allow you to use "as many computers as you like" with the standard subscription. If you don't want to take advantage of their synchronization functionality, you should be able to turn that off, and just backup all your machines using the same account/license on each. Unfortunately I don't think they have a Linux client at present. 

You are already on top of the two most likely solutons... the USB to Parallel converter cable, and a PCMCIA to Parallel converter. Why the two most likely? Well... because you other solutions are more expensive and/or even LESS attractive. Have I ever used the USB to Parallel cable and have it work with XP? Yes. It is simply a matter of configuring everything properly. Down to getting ECP/EPP/SPP right, etc. Have I done so that that specific Dot Matrix Printer? Nope. But I have with an IBM 2390 Plus. Is there a difference between using the cable, and the PCMCIA card? Yes. The PCMCIA card adds a parallel port to the computer. Just to be clear... you went into the driver properties, and made sure that it was pointing to this new LPT port, and you opened up the print spooler and removed any print jobs that were sitting there unprinted... right? Your other options are to move to a different dot matrix printer that you can connect to, or get a different laptop that has a parallel port (like, a used Toshiba Satellite A75 on eBay or something) or confront the person who intentionally sabotaged your setup and inform them that since THEY have decided to start making changes to what computers are there and how this is all set up, THEY are now responsible for getting everything working again. 

Just looking at my machine here (unfortunately XP so admittedly not the same), if I go into the exceptions tab in firewall settings, and edit the "File and Printer Sharing" entry, there is an option to "Change Scope". This presents you with the following three options: 

Is it possible to do this? I'm using Outlook with my GMail account, and as such I don't really need/want the Junk E-mail folder as GMail does a sufficiently good job in filtering out the spam. I've tried using both another email client (Thunderbird) and the GMail web app to remove the folder, but Outlook just recreates it the next time it starts up. If I can't remove it, is there a way to map the folder Outlook is using to the GMail/Spam folder instead? 

I've just recently started using gSyncit to sync my calendars and contacts from Google to Outlook, and I've had a lot of success with it. In terms of its contact support, it will pull in all of the data you mentioned (name, phone email and image) and lot more besides. It will also allow you to select contact groups for syncing, rather than all contacts. So I just pull in "My contacts", and ignore the rest. It isn't free, but at $15 I think it provides good value. On top of that its already compatible with both the 32- and 64-bit flavours of Outlook 2010. 

If the answer is Yes to all 4 of these questions, then you can simply... download an ISO of Ubuntu, burn a disc from that image you downloaded, boot your computer to the disc, and once it loads, follow the installation instructions to erase your hard drive and replace it with Ubuntu. You said nothing about wanting to set up a dual boot of Ubuntu and Windows. 

If you enter the wrong password three times, you are presented with a unique code. This code can be deciphered and access can be gained. Not every HP professional series laptop comes with this system, but if your model does this, then visit Out-of-Warranty.com, register for free, and send them that code. They may be able to get you into the BIOS. The EEPROM chip has to be accessed and/or cleared manually. This requires knowing where the chip is as well as which pins to short. If this is the case, then it makes even MORE sense why the laptop should be sent to HP to have it cleared. 

If you go into the properties for you VPN connection, on the Network tab select IP version 4 and go into its properties. Then click the advanced button. On the IP settings tab, uncheck the "use default gateway on remote network" box. This should default to sending connections over you DSL line, and traffic to the VPN should still work as expected. (apologies if I've gotten some of the screen/tab names wrong there, they're based on the Vista layout!) 

Is that the precise spelling and capitalization of the label you've tagged your bookmarks with? I've just had a quick play and my bookmarks only appear on the toolbar if the label is spelled precisely the same. And obviously there need to be bookmarks tagged with that label! 

You can create a second instance of the XP mode virtual machine by basing it on the same base image as that of the instance created by the installer. There's a good blog post here that walks through the process (in this case, the author is creating the second VM in order to run IE 6, 7 and 8 side-by-side). EDIT: I should also point out that this process can be used as many times as you like, so you can create more than two copies should you wish to. 

It couldn't be the screen inverter. All that does is provide high AC voltage to the Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light that illuminates most LCD screens. When there is trouble with the inverter, you just have a dark screen. It would never cause the issues you are seeing there, because it in no way connects to the screen in a way that could cause that. Corrupt Video Ram could look like that, but typically is expressed over the whole screen. Yes, there are examples of GPU issues that can be selective... but in general you'd see the issue from the BIOS On. In fact, Video Ram issues will persist even when not using your display. Connect an external monitor, and see if you can see those lines. You can even see corrupt Video Ram issues over a remote VNC connection. 

I do the same, as various of our Intranet sites use NTLM so I use an IE tab for those so that I don't have to provide my domain credentials every time. I use IE tab as opposed to IE tab classic, and for me this too prompts for credentials before switching over to IE. However, once the switch is made my credentials are successfully passed across automatically, without needing to refresh the IE window or type them in by hand. This means I just dismiss the Chrome login dialog, and I'm logged in to the page I need. So it may be worth trying out the other extension instead, to see if that helps. 

You could try out BrowserShots, its free ;) This will also be useful if you want to look at the site in multiple different versions of the same browser (IE6, IE7, IE8 etc), without having to go through installing each version, checking the site then moving on to the next version. 

Run Command Prompt as administrator Type to Command Prompt: %windir%\System32\Sysprep\Sysprep.exe, and hit Enter In sysprep dialog that opens, choose System Cleanup Action as Enter System Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE), select Generalize, select Shutdown Options Shutdown. Click OK Sysprep generalizes now your Windows 7 setup and shuts down your computer. 

... it is designed to use a single fan to cool both the CPU and GPU. Which means you've only got one heat sink to clean. At the very least, checking the condition of the thermal pad between the assembly and the GPU would be in order. This will also give you the opportunity to ensure the assembly is sitting properly on the GPU.

Either way, examine your router, find the reset button, and push it for 10-15 seconds with the router plugged in. Then, treat it as if you just got it brand new. You can even follow the instructions in the manual for how to access it and set it up again. Chances are, if the default IP address for it was 192.168.1.1 and you had just used it before, it will once again be set to the same.
