I had this problem a while back, your keyboard language is set to United Kingdom/British instead of USA/United States. 

The Raspberry Pi does not have an onboard RTC (Real Time Clock). This means that when the Pi is powered off, and back on again, it thinks that it is the same time as when it was powered off. (Assuming is has a which most OS's contain.) Because it does not have a clock that ticks while it is off. There are two ways to combat this: 1. NTP [Network Time Protocol The easiest one by far. Just connect the Pi to a network, either via Ethernet or Wifi, when the Pi boots it will pull the current time from the network. 2. I2C RTC [Real Time Clock] The best method for portable projects, or when a network is not an option. You can purchase an I2C RTC here or here (if you don't want to/can't buy it from these sellers you can just search this on Google). There is a great tutorial for this at The Pi Hut for Raspbian systems. It works by a tiny battery powering a small clock on the module, and when your Pi boots, a script is ran that pulls the current time from this clock. 

If you want to use FTP cross network, then you need to forward port 20. If you want to use SFTP cross network then forward port 22. SFTP is extremely simple if you already use SSH. If you need FTP, and not SFTP, follow this tutorial here: $URL$ 

These hostnames would be visible on the network and you could into any of them without their respective IP address. 

I use Reverse SSH for SSH across a network when I cannot forward the ports on the server. Just have your Pi run every minute or so using (or by some other way) and on your computer/client run the command and just keep that running. You will have to forward port 1337 on the network that your client is on. 

You do not need to change if you want your Pi 3 running at 1.2Ghz, if you want to overclock it, that is a whole different question. Hope this helps. 

You shouldn't need to do anything different to use wifi. As long as you set up your wifi correctly, VNC and SSH will work exactly the same as they did with ethernet. 

Explanation: USB sound cards are registered as card 1 on Raspbian Jessie. On Wheezy they would be registered as card -2 by default and editing would change that. I do not know if this next step is necessary but without it my card wouldn't work. Create and edit the file by using the command ~/.asoundrc` and change it so that it only reads this: 

I know it is said to be $5 but when I looked at MCM and Element14, it was listed as $13. What is the actual price before shipping. 

Check to make sure the command is in the folder by using if it is there, then you may need to edit the file permissions via enter the command: . If that doesn't work, make sure you are typing the name of the command correctly, and that is actually the name. 

Something important to note: This is not hardware dependent. At all. Even if you replace the entire RPi, as long as you are using the same sd card, the hostname will not change. You can even move the sd card between models and it will keep the hostname you have set. 

These are for if you want 3.5mm jack audio input. If you had a microphone with a 3.5mm jack. They also have a 3.5mm output. 

Assuming you have no other disks plugged in, you could use a very simple python script. Something like: 

and use RCA video out only. NOTE: There is no composite audio out on the Pi Zero without something fancy, like Hi-Fi Pi. Image source: Element14 

makes it so that the user and the user have permission to access . makes it so that all files written over will be done be , even though can still write files, it will look like did it. Make sure you do: and after you edit this file, so you can set a password for both users. NOTE: Never allow guest/public access to your folder, it's not only outrageously insecure, but it's probably bad practice to broadcast your entire filesystem to anyone with a computer in the area. 

My Raspberry Pi Zero running Jessie Lite finishes the boot messages in 4.9 seconds, and allows me to log in after 10 seconds. 

If it is not shown in the GUI interface, it is possible that it was not installed properly, or at all. Try: 

USB Since the module communicates with 5v UART, you can buy a cheap UART to USB (PL2303hx) converter. Pin connections are as such: 

2. USB Rubber Ducky A USB Rubber Ducky is a flash drive-looking device that is actually a keyboard emulator. They're quite expensive for your needs and annoying, but it would work. 

where is the baudrate of your GPS, probably 9600 or 115200. This will work, assuming your file is correct, which it may not be, as you've edited it by hand, instead of using . 

I'm assuming you're using the command to record audio. I had this same problem a while back. Simply add to your command. If you are using pocketsphinx for your speech recognition: Then you also need to add to your pocketsphinx command. 

Just like @Ghanima said, the top two, labeled "RUN" are the reset pins, if you wire them together it will hard reset your Pi. Now, as for the bottom two pins, the square one is TX (signal) and the circular one is ground. 

is not possible without a network connection. I have a Pi in a similar scenario and I use an HC-06. It is a serial bluetooth module, and it allows me to access the command line via Bluetooth. You might want to check this blog post out. 

I want to purchase a USB Power Bank, one of the tiny portable ones, to power my Pi Zero, I need it to last at least 12 hours, but preferably 15 hours, for a comfortable safety cushion of time. My Pi would not be using WiFi and would only be using a USB sound card and a USB camera. The processor would be at 75-100% almost all the time. This link shows the power consumption of the Pi Zero, which at max is 800mA. So what size power bank would I need to purchase? 

A USB OTG connector is just a micro USB male to USB type A female but some of the pins are grounded and there are extra pins. You can still use any type of micro USB cord that supports data and power, or you can use an OTG cable. So yes, a physical adapter would work fine. 

I have looked at all of the questions on here and other sites and done what they've said and nothing is working. My wifi used to work and now it doesn't nothing has changed with my network, I made sure. I wanted it to have a static IP of 172.16.0.16 but right now I don't really care about the IP, I just want it to work. Here are my files: : 

As for the files that won't play, they were most likely either corrupt or were incorrectly converted from another format. 

I had this exact same problem. I needed ~6v ~1A from the GPIOs so I bought a boost converter, stripped a usb cable, attached + and - to the boost converter and put the output on a transistor, the base of that transistor was hooked up to a GPIO pin on my Pi. 

Just like most other issues with the Raspberry Pi, this is most likely a power issue. Make sure you are using a short and thick USB cable. And a supply that provides at least at , but I highly recommend using a at or supply. EDIT: As Steve said, a powered USB hub is also a good idea. 

Yes, you can write files directly to the card if you plug the SD card into another computer. It will not cause any harm to the OS, as long as you put the files in the right partition. 

Ok, first delete the file Raspbian Jessie does not use this config file like Wheezy did. To find what address your device uses you need to first enter the command this shows all audio output devices, and their address. For example, my USB sound card comes up as device 1 in the output which looks like this.
