It looks like Motion's options changed since your linked tutorial was written. The config option you were looking for () seems to have been changed to : 

Those figures should hold fine for the Pi 2, so you're looking at a minimum of -25 degrees C. If your Pi's that cold I hope that you have a large hat and some mittens. There are anecdotal reports (the link to the original writeup has rotted) of Pis working down to -110 degrees C in nitrogen, which is reassuring for anyone living in chillier climes. 

The setup used has the battery simultaneously hooked up to a 5V regulator to feed to Pi, and a voltage divider which feeds the ADC which feeds GPIO pins. A Python script monitors the input from the ADC to determine when the battery voltage drops below a cutoff point. 

There's a complete walkthrough here on using VLC to capture and stream the desktop of a PC to a second machine. At the time of writing there is a bug in versions subsequent to 2.1.5 which prevent this from working. Install 2.1.5 from here first. It may be necessary to tweak the settings provided there to reduce the video stream resolution and/or quality to achieve reasonable results on the Pi. In summary: 

You will have to purchase an amplifier. I took an old set of computer speakers and grabbed the amplifier out of it. It runs on 12v. This is a snippet from my tutorial on a Pi Arcade: Power Harness and Audio Amplifier 

Check out this tutorial on Adafruit NFC/RFID on Raspberry Pi Add RFID/NFC read and write to your Pi in an hour! . Here is the product page 

For starters, you only posted half your code. Since you are trying to communicate between the 2, both codes are helpful. Nevertheless, try the below code. This code will communicate between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The Pi is the sender (Transmitter) and the Arduino is the receiver. You might need to adjust the import paths as your code is most likely in a different location. This code was taken from the examples provided in the github repo and the examples directory of the source code: Pin out: 

I created a program in c called which allows you mount a MAX OS share or Windows Share without exposing your password. Once mounted, you can transfer files. Github Sharemounter SSH in to your Pi and enter 

I installed rvm and Ruby 1.9.3p194 on a Raspberry Pi using Debian Linux. When I installed pry using , everything installed perfectly but typing pry in a terminal didn't work: 

it's absolutely possible to use a single board machine of some kind to create a network security system. Here is an example: $URL$ and an instructables project showing exactly what you are looking for: $URL$ 

After hardly rebooting my raspberry pi 2 running raspian it does not work anymore, when I turn it on everything works fine until this error message shows up repeatedly. The machine then goes to emergency mode. I didn't find any answer online, any ideas? 

after this your code will work fine. to execute commands "at boot", if autologin is enabled (since what it really does it execute them when the pi user logs in), i'd suggest editing the file wich is in the directory. just add these two lines at the end of the file: 

I just installed glib in Raspbian(Debian version). I want to read a config file using glib. I am trying to write a C application in Codeblocks and I use the header 

I have seen a number of tutorials on using GPIO P6 to work as a power switch. Is this safe? Does this approach do a "safe shutdown" - ? 

All of a sudden, my Pi will not boot. So I throw in another card and the Pi boots up. So the card is corrupt. I reformat it, and try again. Nothing. So now I want to know if the card is really bad, I reformat it and try storing some files and retrieving them from a PC. I am able to store data on the card. My question is, if I can store and retrieve data why cant the Pi boot? 

Save the file: Ctrl+X to exit, Y to save followed by enter twice As for pull up resistor: before you start wiring up your GPIO, you should read up Ohms Laws and Resistors. If you don't use pull up or pull down resistors with your GPIO, you can fry your Raspberry Pi. The numbers in the are your GPIO pin numbers: 

If I remove the , it will mount but I need to access the directory as root, which I am trying to avoid. Any help is really appreciated. 

it probably is a power supply problem. The allowed voltage range is the normal one (for 5V logic) 5.0V Â±5% so its a the range between 4.75V and 5.25V. Note that the lower limit of 4.75V is more a matter of many USB devices not working below that value than it is that the PI itself is that sensitive, especially as much of it (including the ethernet/hub chip, and the SD-card) is working from 3,3V through a regulator on board of the PI that will keep working even with say 4.0V. Also note that many 5V logic devices will be damaged by voltages of 6.5V or higher! Therefore there is a protection device on the PI (D17) that will short the 5V supply if about 6.0V is supplied! Then the (poly)fuse will blow out to protect D17 from burning up! If you do not power the PI through the normal micro-USB port then you are actually bypassing that fuse! there is a section of the PI Wiki at $URL$ dedicated to boot problems like this. 

Download geckodriver from below location and add it to your PATH veriable. $URL$ Exit existing command line and reopen the same. This should help you.
