The SendTo folder is determined on a per-user basis (usually at C:\Documents and Settings\USER\SendTo). It's an absolute path that's located in the registry, there is no common SendTo folder that applies to all users. You can, however, easily change the location of the SendTo folder without muddling around in the registry. Simply right-click-drag the SendTo folder to the new location and select "Move To". The registry entry will be updated automatically for that user. Unfortunately, you have to do this for each user, or load up that user's registry hive and edit it manually (again, per user). It would probably be best to update one user's registry (By using 'Move To' or manually) then export that registry key to a file. Then, distribute that file to the users and have them double click it themselves, merging the new SendTo location into their respective registries. The key is at and my default location was the absolute path, The contents of the whatever.reg file that could be distributed would look something like: 

I was under the impression that Windows 7 only virtualizes Windows XP, for backwards compatibility. You load up FoxPro, and it has problems with Windows 7 so it virtualizes Windows XP to run that window. Also, you have to have a specific processor feature. Not all processors will support Windows 7 Virtualization. You're better off with VMWare Server or MS Virtual Server. 

Go to Control Panel>Default Programs>Set program access and computer defaults>Custom>Choose a default web browser> and set it to Internet Explorer. Test it now, it should work. You can change it back to Firefox after this (I have never had to change it after, so this part I am not sure about). 

I doubt you can change it on your computer. You should probably buy a powered USB hub. Google "powered usb hub" without the quotes. 

For the OfficeJet J3680, there is a driver on the HP site: $URL$ (full featured) $URL$ (basic features) For the Deskjet 5150, use the Windows 7 OfficeJet 5100 driver, it will work fine. 

Unless one of these freeze methods, or other tricks, makes the BIOS see the drive, and it spins up, there will be nothing you can really do other than send it to a data recovery specialty company, which would take the platters out and put them in the exact same drive so it would spin. This can be very expensive. If you attempt to do this on your own, you will almost certainly cause more damage since it is very tricky to do, so don't unless you have no other choice, and have nothing to lose except the cost of another drive to try it with. If you get it to be seen by the BIOS, try to image it ASAP, and do nothing more. SeaTools on a dying drive was not a good approach. 

RocketFish is a company that rebrands a products made by companies that no one's ever heard of. That way Best Buy (who owns RocketFish) can sell products that look like they are backed by a large company, but still don't look like the 'Store Brand'. It might be possible to find out what the product or model number originally was and get drivers from the actual manufacturer, though the actual manufacturer's webpage is likely in Chinese. 

The wheel click and wheel rotation are to completely separate sensors. You've got a broken mouse on your hands. 

I just happens to some LCD monitors sometimes. I have a monitor that if you leave a webpage open for too long, the title bar will start to discolor the screen when it's removed. I've found that leaving a solid black or solid white image on the screen overnight generally fixes the problem. I would just turn down the brightness (for less power consumption and monitor longevity, the backlight has nothing to do with the 'burn in') and leave a screen saver on overnight. On my monitor, once the screen is back to normal, it doesn't come back for a while. 

I've been warned that this isn't recommended (except by Microsoft). The warnings are also centered around the command's close relative, ExitWindowsEx (Which shuts down the computer). I've never had any issues with it, but YMMV. 

Some flash drives (like U3 enabled drives) come with a small partition that is read like a CD drive to the computer. This way the flash drive can load up software on computers that have CD autorun enabled, but Mass Storage Device (Flash drives) autorun disabled. That CD portion can be overridden with some work and effectively becomes a read-only section of the drive. It's not a whole lot of help in your case because A) there isn't a whole lot of room on the CD side and B) there is still a writable flash drive attached. 

This does cost $59, but if you want a program that you can REALLY lock someone down, and do it easily, try "Fortres 101" (yes, the spelling is correct). You can try it free for a month. $URL$ (I do not know why it says "Version 6.5 for Windows 2000", but the platforms correctly says "Windows 7 (32 Bit and 64 Bit)/Vista/XP". Get the top one.). 

It sounds like you uninstalled this program from the Dell web site for your computer model: Dell Help and Support Customizations 

Try this: Do a to get the 8.3 name of the folder (it will look like docume~1), then do a (you may even truncate it more like if there are no other directories with similar names). If this does not work, the run (maybe a couple of times even, but check your Event Viewer>Windows Logs>Application Log to see if there are still a lot of errors. $URL$ screenshots 6 or 8). Then try the rd command with the 8.3 again as above. 

Based on your other question, whatever was on the drive, including any partitions, will still be there. Even if the partitions were deleted, unless you secure wiped them, data recovery software would mostly likely be able to pull the data. 

I might approach this task a bit differently: I would consider just setting up a scheduled task to run a batch file with as an administrator every minute. It is not exactly processor intensive, and if it is already started, it will do nothing. I would put the batch file used to start the service in a location that is secured for administrator only so it cannot be edited to change what it is doing. This way you also do not have to worry about it not starting if someone is not there to do it manually. 

As mentioned else where, DynDNS service will update a name server (where www.example.com gets translated to 127.123.234.10 or whatever) periodically. I just wanted to add that some network routers have this feature built in, like most Linksys routers. That way you don't even need software running on the computer. 

I just use Paint. When you move the mouse around, it displays the pixes of wherever the mouse is on the status bar, even if it's not in the foreground. With a 2000x2000 image you can resize the window to any shape. 

The only thing that could cause problems by cutting the power are the TV, and the Wii (assuming everything else is powered down). Some TV have to reboot if they lose power. On my TV it takes about minute, though it doesn't lose any settings. It's possible the Wii could be downloading something while you unplug it (if the light is yellow instead of red) but that risk is small enough to not worry about. Just make sure the everything is turned off and you'll be fine. As for the CMOS batteries, those take years to run down. 

You don't have to activate your second computer right away. It will work for several days before the OS requires you to activate it. I don't even think you're required to type in your product key right away. Just click 'continue' when asked for it. Just transfer all your files, then turn the first computer off, then activate your new one. 

TeamViewer is THE way to go in my opinion. You would install the Full version, set it to start with Windows, and set a specific password. After you have it setup, and have the 9-digit code, it will work EXACTLY as you described you wanted. $URL$ You go into the Extras>Options>General to set it to start with Windows: 

First, I am going to assume that you are on a home network and that your router hands out DHCP (automatic) IP addresses. If not, you MUST contact your network administrator, or you will cause problems if you introduce a duplicate IP address on the network. Second, this seems like an easy question, but there are a few things you need to do in order to really make sure you are doing it right. In practice, even if you don't, in a home network, you probably won't experience problems since the odds of a duplicate IP are low, but it is still very possible, so it is easier to do it right. I realize the following seems a bit long, but it is fairly easy to follow, however, if you have questions, please post back and I will answer them. Next, you should try to figure out what IP addresses your DHCP server is handing out so you pick an IP that it will not give to another computer later. The best way is to go into your router as this is probably where you are getting your DHCP IP address from. Usually it is somewhere in its LAN settings, or near them (check your manual, or ask a separate question here with your router model listed), you can find the range it is handing out. Often it is x.x.x.100-x.x.x.254. If that is not easy for you, or you don't know the router's password, we can make an educated guess: You can open a command box, and do an . That will give you your IP address and default gateway (usually your router). Also take note of your DNS servers, as you will also need to enter them below. Pick an IP address that is not your router's address, and add 20. So if your router is 192.168.1.1, then pick 192.168.1.20. The subnet mask for a home network is almost always 255.255.255.0 (it is the same as your IPCONFIG/ALL), and the gateway you enter when you set the static will be the same as in the IPCONFIG/ALL. The only caveat is that if your IP address when you did the IPCONFIG/ALL is very low, like 192.168.1.2 or near that (we are only really looking at the last number), then the DHCP range being given out is low, so pick something like 192.168.1.250. Whatever IP you pick, open a command box, and do PING 192.168.1.20 (or whatever IP you pick to be your static). So now that you have how to figure out what IP to use, here is how to implement it. Go to and right-click your Wireless Network connection. Double-click , and enter your settings as in the sample screenshot based on what you came up with in the first part of the question. I added 8.8.8.8 as another DNS server, which you can use if your IPCONFIG showed only the router, otherwise, if you had two DNS servers listed, use them. 

99% of cell phones (and all electronic devices) will cause absolutely zero ill effects on an airplane. They ask you to keep your phone and other radio equipment off to make sure that the other 1% does not interfere with any of the airliner's communication equipment. It's to make absolutely sure that the plane can operate safely with no outside interference they have to deal with. 

It's refurbished, meaning it's used. Someone used that Windows licence (even if it was for only a minute). You can't get your money back from not using Windows because that Windows was already paid for. That Windows licence cannot be applied to any other computer so there is no reason the retailer will discount the price of the computer because you don't want software that they can't resell. 

You might have to set the boot device, but generally no, you don't have to set anything up. I'd still open it up and LOOK at the settings, just to see what's available for changing later. 

Add the number of hard drives minus 1. Either all the drives have to be the same size, or if you use different sizes, the RAID will treat all the drives the same as it would the smaller one. 10 1TB hard drives equal 9TB of storage. 9 1TB drives and one 500GB drives is 4.5TB of storage (each 1TB is treated as a 500GB) 

It would seem like yes. Follow the instructions here: $URL$ (go to "Configure Outlook 2011 for Office 365"). These links may also be helpful: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

What you are asking for is impossible. If you were able to ignore the local network totally, how would you find the default gateway to even route to your VPN? What is your real intent, I may be able to help you with that. In other words, why would you care about seeing your local network in the first place, and what is your real concern? 

Do you, or did you, have another antivirus on there recently? How about running now? AVG, Norton, etc.? This looks like your problem: $URL$ And this is how to disable it and stop the message: $URL$ 

Now that you are hopefully clean, I would do a system restore to a time before you became infected. That will not affect any documents you have, but will turn back the time on your registry, which was probably affected by the virus, and allow the service to start again. 

OK, 6 months later, but the answer is that Microsoft simply dropped support without notification. So what was working one day, was no longer working the next. I only realize this when I used an old image, where it worked, but do not when I restored it. That lead me to these links: $URL$ $URL$ 

Flash is designed to not let you use full screen while it doesn't have focus. Probably to keep web pages from taking over your desktop. I can't speak for silverlight, but flash will: 

or whatever your firefox path is. The easiest way to do this would be to copy an existing shortcut and add 'about:blank' (or any webpage) to the end of the . 

Make sure you have the latest version of flash, not all versions support hardware acceleration. I think it starts at Flash 9.0.115.0. What type of CPU do you have? It's possible the bottleneck is not with the GPU. 

I've heard that refrigerating the drive ahead of time yields better success rates. Don't know by how much though. 

I don't think you're entitled to student discounts just because you were once in a school. Just buy the student edition anyway, most retailers don't care. Just don't use it for profit. 

It is possible to change one of the DLL files flash uses with a hex editor to keep it open. The exact steps to change the DLL changes with every flash version. Here is a YouTube link, but for those who find watching a 30 second video to obtain a pragraph of text horrendously inefficient, here is a (paraphrased) transcript. 

Turn on capslock. Place something heavy on the shift key. Everything you type will be in lowercase, but if you type a - it will be a _ 

I would suggest following the steps in this document: $URL$ I would especially take note of "Resolution 2: Run the System Update Readiness Tool". That that does is check you system for prerequisites and problems in the your files and registry that would prevent the service pack from installing. It then, hopefully, fixes them. It takes at least 15 minutes to run, so it is working even if you start to wonder. When I found this tool just last week, it finally fixed a problem installing SP1 on Vista that had me pulling at my hair. I hope it does the same for you. 

I am with you: No, I have never gotten it to return a solution either, but sometimes the data in the "View problem details" has been helpful to me. If you do send the information to Microsoft, while it may or may not help, I think they do look at some of the responses (maybe automated) to help improve the code. 

I don't know that I agree with the statement: "ReadyBoost focus is reducing RAM usage, instead of increasing hard drive access times." It is primarily used for caching files, so they do not have to be read from the hard disk again, which is slower. Unless you have an SSD drive, I believe you would probably notice the difference. I saw a big difference, especially with things associated with the Interface. $URL$
