I have a student mail at my university which is setup to redirect all incoming emails to my old hotmail/outlook free account. I also want to be able to send emails from my free account, as the student account (without using masquerade). The university uses the microsoft lisam suite and outlook free apparently doesn't find their smtp server. the guide on lisam outlook says this: 

Hooked the executable to see from where it was called. CrashPlan is once again delivering a superior experience by crashing my computer. Can't believe I'm paying for it, this is like the 4th time so far they've had a bug that crashed my computer. They're running a restart.bat which kills the daemon and restarts it, and then never exits. I've filed a ticket. 

I would guess this is a hardware limitation. Most keyboards only support a few keypresses at the same time. You can test this by typing "the quick fox jumps over the lazy dog" while holding down both shift keys all the way through the sentence. Try using another keyboard, or maybe even the other shift key. 

You dont need to mark bad sectors manually. Hard disks have a pool of spare, good sectors. When bad sectors are found they are automatically flagged and replaced by spare, good ones. All this is invisible to the user. FYI, you can use tools like Crystaldiskinfo and HD tune to monitor bad sectors, if the drive is SMART enabled (most drives are). However, please also run a hdd diagnostic (depending on your hdd brand). Harddrive diagnostic Tools and services - Tacktech.com A few bad sectors are normal after a period of use. You should backup critical data from that disk on a priority basis. Unless the bad sector count is extremely high, keep a watch over it, particularly for sudden increases. When that happens, be prepared to order a new drive. 

Hi so i was doing some research in the library so i could use some pictures later on my Desktop computer in my room. I have space on my Lab account which i usually SSH into, and i was wondering if URL's can be directly transferred over to a remote machine and saved on the hard disk. I was thinking something like this: 

The huge number of processes was caused by Crashplan crashing due to running out of memory. It tried to restart itself once a minute, but it immediately crashed again, spawning new copies of these processes after each restart. The memory was capped by the java process at 1GB, but I needed about 3GB of heap. For some reason, they seem to store the entire index of all backed up files in memory. The hotfix was to allow it to use 4gigs of memory; . The slowness/artifacts of the task manager was probably because I was running thousands of processes; apparently they didn't test that use-case. I guess that they're redrawing the screen based on a wall-clock timer, and that didn't finish drawing the screen before having to start drawing the next one. 

Resizing the window from the bottom and dragging it to the edge of the screen to activate the snap function worked. 

my computer started crashing to a completely black display where it would try and restart immediately. First it was happening during a game only and i thought it was some memory leak within the game that was causing it. After a day i tried again and everything was back to normal. But then tonight it started happening all the time and it even crashed once while i was in the BIOS. This obviously helped a lot with the diagnosis because i now i know for a certainty that it's hardware related. So i tried to play around with the RAM, i own 12 gigs of ram half of which are around a year older than the other half. So i played around with the DIMM orientations till finally it kept happening even when i was down to 6 gigs of ram. Mind you at one point i had 6 gigs installed but only 4 gigs showing up as usable, which is what lead me to believe it was the RAM or the DIMM. I currently have 4 x 2gig triple channel memory sticks installed, but windows only shows 6 gigs, of course it should show 8. I had previously thought it was one of the DIMM channels, but now it seems to be random. As a result, I am now a bit stumped. I know its not my gfx card, the chances of a CPU malfunction are extremely slim, and i've had normal temperatures always, i run a liquid loop too. I've ruled out the RAM sticks that i own, well not all of them, but the random DIMM slots malfunctioning doesn't seem to be fit that situation. My last two places to turn my attention are the motherboard and my PSU. I own an ASUS Rampage III Extreme and i know these things are notorious for causing problems from nowhere. My PSU is a Corsair HX 1000W and i'm more inclined to thinking that its not the PSU but i'm not sure, i just trust corsair more. Also, there are no Error reports, only sometimes does Windows report that something bad went wrong, i'm sure there are memory dumps, but i'm not sure what you guys would need. My Specs: Windows 8 Professional 64-Bit. i7-950 - Stock speed for now. GSkill -12 gigs 1600Mhz RAM. GTX 580 from EVGA. 128 Gb SATA 3 Samsung 830 series.

Change the range corresponding to your needs. You have to save your file as . Then every text in the range is converted to uppercase. 

You get this error due of the inner . When contains "BX17" returns 1 (as number), otherwise it returns "DDR". When contains "BX17" the around it returns "BX18", otherwise it returns the -error. interprets the returning 1 as and would interpret 0 as . But it can't interpret the string "DDR" which is returned. 

First you have to change your second criteria area to . Then you have to change your second criteria to so your function reads 

You can use the -function to get the position of the commas and after that split the string for latitude and longitude. So can use for latitude 

I would use this field only for small formulas, I want to use in flow text. For ambitious, big formulas, I would use the equation editor. 

So theres this question in my book and it doesn't state exactly how to go about actually calculating utilization anywhere, and i'm not being able to find any substantial information regarding everything i need to solve this question.(My mid term is next week). Anyway, here's the question:

The main reason for keeping AHCI on when you use a SSD to install windows is to instruct the OS to run its TRIM command. Once this has been activated windows will continue to run the TRIM command. My current set up is similar to yours, if not identical in implementation. I have a 6Gb/s Intel 830 128 gb SSD which i installed windows 8 on using AHCI. Trim is currently running. I have 2 x 320gb HDs in RAID 0 as well. My current BIOS setting for Hard drive orientation is RAID, this is so that it sets up the array each time. You can even keep other singular drives on the other SATA controllers, you need to actually specify the drives used in RAID for them to be so. Therefore to answer your question, no they won't affect it at all. The RAID setting in the BIOS just informs the controller that it needs to set up and maintain a specific array that needs to be defined in the RAID BIOS(yes the controller has its own BIOS). For reference i leave my BIOS mode in RAID. Hope this helps, i can answer any other specific questions you have as i have had considerable experience with RAID 

I think you can't do this with . But you could use the -option of Excel. Apply a auto-filter to your table. In the dropdown of column "A" you can choose "contains not", there you enter "ST". So you get only these rows, where the code starts not with "ST". 

I understand the question so, that the OP searches a solution for describing these line breaks, he wants to eliminate. I assume OP knows how to solve the task programmatically and I recommend doing the removal with a VBA macro. (The search criterias are pseudo-like VBA.) The first line break is always at the first position of the string. So the search criteria is something like . The other line breaks are always at the last position of the string. So the search criteria is something like . The third possible line break is not shown in the examples, it would be a blank line between two texts. Obviously this are two consecutive and can be removed with a simple "search and replace". Note that the search criterias have to be used in a loop to get multiple occurrences. 

I'm unable to login through ssh using PuTTy on windows. Everything works fine on linux and mac. Any idea or good alternative? I tried changing the character encoding to UTF-8 but no luck there. Edit: Here's all information I have on my setup: the "error message" from the putty terminal: 

I'm running a fairly high end computer at around 30% load. For some reason, task manager is very slow. I'm getting black artifacts, the tabs aren't always loading and sometimes it just freezes. Everything else seems to work just fine. For some reason, it's running with normal priority, rather than above normal, and I cannot change it. Maybe this changed with Windows 10? What can I do about this, other than reinstalling Windows? Is it enough to suspect something messing with task manager, like a rootkit trying to stay hidden? EDIT: apparently I have a few thousand and running with no parent process. Smallest processid is 224, which is before login. There are also 470k handles open. This will require some digging. 

These overlay icons are from a version control system. I think yours are from Subversion SVN. If your are really sure, you want to remove these icons, you can delete the hidden -folder in the top folder where the icons appear. Another possibilty is to deinstall the subversion-application e.g. "TortoiseSVN" or something like that. 

I found a solution with VBA: Do a right-click on the tab of your worksheet and chose "Show code...". In the VBA-Editor enter these macro: 

You can delete the file in your workspace-folder under the path . This resets the workbench and the file is generated new. 

Mark the two rows at the top and the bottom of the hidden area (in your example row 95 and 254). After that chose "expand" or "unhide" from the appropriate menu or right click on the selection. 

This creates a tarball of the 2 files file1 and file2. As i said earlier you can throw things at the tarball and it will still be fine! 

So this started all of a sudden. I'm not sure exactly when but a few days ago. Basically i am running Windows 8.1 on a Samsung 850 SSD. Nothings wrong with it, but suddenly after it gets into windows, there's a reallllly slow patch where no applications will open and for a good 1 minute the computer will be in a sort of stasis. The icons on boot up for all my files are white and I have to manually hit refresh for them to load. The sequence is thus: 

The drivers are currently in no state to be called anything but beta drivers. The support is abysmal. However, reinstall them using these methods. But before you do, make sure you purge the current drivers using:
