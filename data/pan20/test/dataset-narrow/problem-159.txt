What kind of equipment do you have connecting to the providers? If it is a Cisco device you could use IP SLA to ping a destination like 8.8.8.8 over the primary ISP. As soon as you don't get a reply failover to the other static route. Example config: 

A user had issues with download speed from the Internet. The connection to the Internet is 100 Mbit/s. The user got around 7 Mbit/s downstream and around 80 Mbit/s upstream. I tested from my computer and it got around 70 Mbit/s downstream and 80 Mbit/s upstream. Obviously the users PC was to blame. I checked the switch which is a Catalyst 3560 and there it was as I expected, the port was in half duplex. The user had hard coded his PC to 100/full and the port was using auto. The speed is detected by the Fast Link Pulses (FLP) but the duplex must be assumed to be half so the port was using 100/half. With show controller I could see collisions and late collisions as expected. The bandwidth was tested via the swedish site www.bredbandskollen.se. It uses TCP to test the latency at first. Then it opens a socket via Flash and does several HTTP GET (TCP) and measures the downstream bandwith for about 10 seconds. After that it does four HTTP posts to the server and sends traffic for 10 seconds and calculates the upstream bandwidth. I know that these kind of sites are not 100% accurate but usually they can at least give some kind of indication if you are close to receiving the kind of bandwidth that you should and it was an easy test to run to make sure it was the user and not the network at fault here. 

Downstream you might be able to download something to null: on the ASA but upstream you would be limited of how much the flash disk can transfer which is usually not that much. Your best bet would be to connect a PC and run the tests but that requires someone to be on site of course. 

Referring to IP in an access list refers to all IP based protocols. You have denied echo replies but all other messages as ICMP redirect, time exceeded, fragmentation needed, echo would be allowed through. Other IP based protocols such as OSPF would also be allowed to pass through with your ACL. 

Cisco FAQ If you really want to find out then you could test it with a script generating configuration and then pasting it in. My guess is you will get bored before you run into any limit though. 

I think that this is the kind of configuration you are looking for. However, note that there is a caveat because there is no available for translation. That means that as soon as one of your hosts communicate with , there will be no free IP's in the pool. What you can do is to increase the so that you reserve maybe 10 IP's that are only used for . 

R1 has a cost of 1 to this stub network. R2 can reach this network through the 12.12.12.0/24 transit network. So we need to add a cost of 10 which brings the total metric to 11. 

From a BGP perspective, there is not much you can do. You could stop advertising your prefix but then you are just completing the DoS attack because noone will be able to access your service. If you have multiple prefixes you could renumber but likely the attack will move to the new prefix as well. What you need to do is to work with your upstream. Do they have a scrubbing service? If they have a system such as Arbor Peakflow, they could scrub the traffic and clean it before it enters your network. Such services are often very expensive. There are also other options such as Cloudflare and similar companies where you setup BGP through a GRE tunnel to that company and your traffic gets handled by their "cloud" which can handle a lot more traffic than your local devices. 

What does the topology look like? How are you doing routing today towards these networks? Or is the router being deployed now? Do you have an OSPF capable router connected to this router that is not running OSPF? If you do then I suggest you redistribute static on this router. Something like: 

Your burst values look a bit small. Choosing burst values is not easy and testing might be required to get it right. Also if I remember correctly 3750 does not support policing on egress. Bc works a bit different in policing than it does in shaping. With shaping you buffer packets and you have a token bucket where ever Tc (time interval) you have Bc (Commited Burst) bytes added to the bucket. The formula is Tc = Bc / CIR. On some platforms Tc is fixed as well so you don't have the option of configuring it. When you use policing you don't use fixed time intervals. Instead when packet arrives policer calculates how many bytes have accumulated. So say that you are policing at 10 Mbit/s. You have configured a Bc of 10000 bytes. A burst packet arrives at t0 that make up 5000 bytes of traffic. So 5000 bytes are deducted. Then at t1 5 ms later another batch of 5000 bytes of packets arrive. The policer is set 10 Mbit/s, which is 1250000 bytes per second. That means that 1250000 * 0,005 = 6250 bytes have been added to the 5000 that were left from the first run at t0. So the packets are allowed through. From this example you can see that at t1 it could have been allowed to send 5000 + 6250 = 11250 bytes but because Bc was set to 10000 bytes the policer would drop anything above that. What if 6000 bytes of packets had arrived? Then some packets would have to be dropped. This is where Be comes into play. Be will allow to accumulate some extra credit from idle intervals. So if Be had been configured to be 20000 bytes then the 6000 bytes could have been passed through the policer. Be adds a bit of fairness to the policer but it also allows bigger bursts of traffic to go through. Remember that in the end the CIR is still enforced so on average it's not possible to send more than CIR. This article from Juniper recommends setting burst to 5ms worth of traffic which in your case would be 6250000 bytes. 

First, like the others have mentioned you have no bridging loop here due to running a Portchannel. That said, running STP is still fine. Let me clear some confusions on how these commands work on Cisco switches.
