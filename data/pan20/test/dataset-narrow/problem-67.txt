That is official documentation from Cisco, so I don't doubt that. As far as L2 header is concerned it is added depending on the L2 technology(Ethernet, Frame Relay etc.) The document is not taking L2 header in consideration, but when you will calculate packet size for VoIP Packet, it will be taken into consideration. 

I would suggest you to connect NAS to the router instead of switch and camera also(if you have only one camera). 3 different networks would do. 

The Window Size field in each TCP header indicates the amount of empty space, in bytes, remaining in the receive buffer. The field is 16 bits in TCP, but with the Windows Scale option, values larger than 65535 can be used. Windows scale option increases the Window Size from 16 bit to 30 bit. Instead of changing the field size, however, the header still holds a 16 bit value, and an option is defined that applies a scaling factor to the 16 bit value. Window Scale RFC is 1323. (TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1.) 

eth 2 Address: 10.0.0.0 Netmask: 255.0.0.0 = 8 Wildcard: 0.255.255.255 => Network: 10.0.0.0/8 Broadcast: 10.255.255.255 HostMin: 10.0.0.1 HostMax: 10.255.255.254 Hosts/Net: 16777214 eth 1 Address: 10.10.0.0 Netmask: 255.255.0.0 = 16 Wildcard: 0.0.255.255 => Network: 10.10.0.0/16 Broadcast: 10.10.255.255 HostMin: 10.10.0.1 HostMax: 10.10.255.254 Hosts/Net: 65534 Both are conflicting. 

From your description I can say that it is very much possible, and in any PBX. You should check with your PBX provider if the GSM and Analog Gateway are compatible with it or not. If they are compatible the call forwarding part won't be a hassle. 

Just create a second VLAN for your guest and make sure the uplink ports have the VLAN tagged all the way to your server that is performing the routing/NAT. So tag the new VLAN on the edge port the server is connecting to as well. You have to make sure that your server NIC does understand VLAN tags. If it does not, you will need to get one that does or install a second NIC that will be dealing with the additional VLAN/Subnet. On the edge port where your access point is connecting, make sure that the guest VLAN is tagged and your main VLAN is either tagged or untagged, depending on the configuration on the access point. When creating your WLAN, make sure that you specify which VLAN each WLAN has to use. So for Main SSID you can say VLAN1, and your Guest SSID, VLAN2. This will make sure that the connection is placed on the correct VLAN once a client connects to the AP. For the guest subnet, you need to assign a range of IP addresses, with your server being the gateway. You will also need to deal with DHCP on this VLAN so you need some kind of DHCP relay-agent on the server but I am not 100% sure how this would be configured on your setup, not knowing all the details. Normally you will confiure this on your switch that has the vlan interface configured, which in this case I believe would be your server. If this server is also a DHCP server, then I think as long as the new DHCP scope has been created, you should be all good. Get pfsense to do the routing from your guest VLAN to your WAN interface but do not allow it route to the main VLAN and obviously configure NAT to allow this new subnet to get out to the Internet. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

A call to ephone-dn 1 rings on ephone 1 and on ephone 2. Ephone 1 answers, and the call is no longer visible to ephone 2. A call to ephone-dn 2 issues a call-waiting notification to ephone 1 and rings on ephone 2, which answers. The second call is no longer visible to ephone 1. A call to ephone-dn 3 issues a call-waiting notification to ephone 1 and ephone 2. Ephone 1 puts the call to ephone-dn 1 on hold and answers the call to ephone-dn 3. The call to ephone-dn 3 is no longer visible to ephone 2. A call to ephone-dn 4 is issues a call-waiting notification on ephone 2. The call is not visible on ephone 1 because it has met the two-call maximum by handling the calls to ephone-dn 1 and ephone-dn 3. (Note that the call maximum is six for those phones that are able to handle six call-waiting calls, as previously described.) 

I don't think this will be possible. PC Port on Phone is an access port and you can't change it to trunk port. Why don't you connect PC directly to Phone and then phone to 8 port switch. One trunk to 8-port switch from data switch and your problem is solved. 

I have a Cisco 3550. I wanted to connect a 9971(used) to it, but it is not going beyond POST. I see the keys blinking but nothing happens after that, and this happens in a loop. Could that be a problem with Phone or with Switch? Switch Information - C3550 Software (C3550-IPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.2(44)SE6 Model number: WS-C3550-24PWR-SMI 

I have just been looking at the datasheet for those models. The XS716T supports 16x 100M/1G/10G Copper Ports The XS748T does not support any 100M but 44 x 1G/10G so this is your issue and why you are seeing that it works on the XS716T but not the XS748T. I have found this information here on page 2. 

You could go for a hub and spoke topology where you place your core router at your HQ, being your hub and then your remaining 3 buildings being satelites, will just require distribution switches that can also route back to your HQ building. You need to look at how your data is going to flow. If your satelite buildings are going to access services in your HQ, you need to see what services they are going to be and how much data is going to transfer across the WAN link. This in turn will tell you if your 100/300Mbps link is going to be sufficient. If they are critical services, a redundent WAN link could be used as a backup. Your distribution switches could be stacked, turning 2+ switches into a single switch, while plugging trunk ports to each switch and creating aggregated links for redundancy. If you want to have a redundent gateways, you could make use of VRRP or Cisco's HSRP. Perhaps use MSTP to direct traffic based on VLAN's to specific VRRP instances, so that even numbered VLAN's flow to core router 1 and uneven VLAN's run to core router 2. Or perhaps even look at what is generating the most traffic and balance it out between two core routers. Are the satelite buildings going to host servers that are going to be used by the building? If so, make sure they are connected to distribution switches that will aggregate the connections and use stacked switches to provide connections to multiple stacked switches from the servers. If the servers are going to talk each other constantly, make sure that they are on the same subnet to avoid unnecessary routing and simply keep things as layer 2 where you can. Use VLAN's and make sure you minimize your broadcast domains. Use redundent power supplies where you see fit, use UPS' for equipment providing critical services. The best thing to do first before you start the design process is to analyse what the requirements of the users and services are going to be. Where are things going to be hosted and where can you expect bottlenecks and single point of failure. Then you can look at what equipment you need. Look at how many packets per second the quipment can handle, whether it can have redundent management/fabric modules. THere is alot more information requierd to help you more but this is what I can think of right now and I hope this gives you a bit of an idea. 

bridged adpter in VMWare works as an adapter directly connected to the network. That means it will get IP Address in the range of your NIC IP. If a virtual adapter is configured for NAT then it will get IP Address from internal DHCP of VMWare and the range will be different than the bridged network. You are saying that you have bridged eth0 and eth1. Bridged adapter and NAT adapter can't be bridged(Bridge, Switch are L2 terms). You will have to configure some routing table to connect them. Bridged Networking Bridged networking connects a virtual machine to a network by using the network adapter on the host system. If the host system is on a network, bridged networking is often the easiest way to give the virtual machine access to that network. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a bridged network (VMnet0) is set up for you. NAT Networking With NAT, a virtual machine does not have its own IP address on the external network. Instead, a separate private network is set up on the host system. In the default configuration, a virtual machine gets an address on this private network from the virtual DHCP server. The virtual machine and the host system share a single network identity that is not visible on the external network. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a NAT network (VMnet8) is set up for you. When you use the New Virtual Machine wizard to create a new virtual machine and select the typical configuration type, the wizard configures the virtual machine to use the default NAT network. You can have only one NAT network. Host-Only Networking Host-only networking creates a network that is completely contained within the host computer. Host-only networking provides a network connection between the virtual machine and the host system by using a virtual network adapter that is visible on the host operating system. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a host-only network (VMnet1) is set up for you. Please check VMWare documentation(chapter 5) $URL$ 

There is a way to configure DNS server on your Cisco router. The first portion enables the DNS service on the router and enables lookups on the local router. 

The next step allows you to create manual entries on the router for entries host1, host2 and host3 which will resolve to the IP address at the end, 

If you wanted to perform it only on certain VLAN's, you will need to configure each vlan interface like so. 

The only thing that I have spotted at the moment is that you have no default route. Currently you have traffic only destined to x.x.8.164/30 routed out of VLAN 4010. If this interface goes to the internet I would expect something like the following to be added to tell it that anything not found in the routing table (ie. Internet), send out out the vlan that is connected to your providers IP. 

Sometimes newer models will allow you to use a RJ45 connectors to the switch with a serial connection going to your laptop which seems what you have, so you might be using the wrong cable if your Brocade switch does not have a console port that is RJ45. Just be careful because each vendor seem to do their own cables and even though they look the same, the pinouts might be completely different. For example, I have an extreme networks cable and a HP cable that do not work together, but a cable to the Cisco switches seems to work. In regards to Hyper-Terminal, this can still be found floating around the Internet. But most people will use free clients such as Putty or Tera Term which can do serial, telnet, ssh, etc. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

If the huntstop attribute is set, an incoming call does not roll over (hunt) to another ephone-dn when the called ephone-dn is busy or does not answer and a hunting strategy has been established that includes this ephone-dn. When the no huntstop command is used on the ephone-dn, the call would ring on the first ephone-dn and go through any hunting defined on the two channels in a dual-line ephone-dn before being sent to the next most preferred ephone-dn that also has a matching destination pattern. This will continue until an ephone-dn with huntstop configured is reached or no more dial peers (ephone-dns) have matching destinations patterns. The difference in configuration between overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting and overlaid ephone-dns without call waiting is that overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting use the c keyword in the button command and overlaid ephone-dns without call waiting use the o keyword. Call waiting allows phone users to know that another person is calling them while they are talking on the phone. Phone users hear a call-waiting tone indicating that another party is trying to reach them. Calls to IP phones with soft keys can be answered with the Answer soft key. Example- A Cisco Unified IP Phone 7910 (maximum two call-waiting calls) has a button configured with a set of overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting (button 1c1,2,3,4). A call to ephone-dn 1 is answered. A call to ephone-dn 2 generates call-waiting notification. Calls to ephone-dn 3 and ephone-dn 4 will wait in line and remain invisible to the phone user until one of the two original calls ends. When the call to ephone-dn 1 ends, the phone user can then talk to the person who called ephone-dn 2. The call to ephone-dn 3 issues call-waiting notification while the call to ephone-dn 4 waits in line The following example demonstrates call waiting for overlaid ephone-dns that are shared on two phones: ephone 1 button 1c1,2,3,4 ! ephone 2 button 1c1,2,3,4 

A physical port can and is used for receiving and transmitting unless the port has been specifically configured to half-duplex. I think where you are getting confused is the actual port source and destination which has nothing to do with a physical port. When it comes to NAT, the destination and source port number will be different. The destination port number which will sit on a server that provides the service such as port 80 for HTTP. The software will receive many connection requests on this port number and the software will need to distinguish the different processes for each connection that comes in. The source port number will be a randomly chosen upper port that is not used for any particular service and this will reside on the client device as they are the source of the connection. This also helps the software to distinguish the various connections that are being made for different clients. Imagine a HTTP server with hundreds of simultanious connections and not to mention the different connections the browser will make on port 80 itself as destination. When the data comes back, it relies on the source port number to tell the software where the data is destined for in the upper layers of the stack model. NAT uses the source port number to manage the different connections that are being NAT'd. If they all used the same source port, then NAT, using it's table, would not be able to distinguish between the different connections, and know where it needs to forward the data to on the local network.So a source port is mapped to a local IP address that is on the inside of the NAT for as long as the TCP connection is still alive. To get a better idea of what is happening and to udnerstand why the source port can't be the same, check out this resource: $URL$ $URL$ Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan
