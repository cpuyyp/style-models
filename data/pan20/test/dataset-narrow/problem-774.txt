After quite a bit of searching, I found that I needed to create the /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts structures inside the chroot. 

I am thinking that there has to be a way in mailx command which allows the mail to be send with html format or atleast the tab spaced output as seen in the linux. if this doesn't work by anyways then I need to get the sendmail working. 

I have an LXC container with CentOS 7.4 running. On running expect from Normal user I am getting the below error. 

I have increased the nproc limit in my server to 2047. And I hope that resourse unavailable message will not come again But while entering the java command itself, it is throwing the error "Insufficent memory". I tried to set the java heap memory but that also not allowing. I am not sure how to proceed further. Please help!! OS is Centos 6.8 Java Version is Jdk 1.6 Virtualization is LXC multiple Virtual machines are running in host server. Free memory is 15GB across all virtual machines. 

But still I am not able to run the expect command as a normal user. I have some scripts which needs to be run as normal user with expect statements. I have done all possible ways which I can think of. Please help!! 

But I am not getting how to mention local server (client server) path as directory. when ever i try adding a virtual directory it is saying path doesn't exists. This path /home/oracle/exportDB is in client server. Can you please give me suggestions as I am out of options. PS: I am doing this for a POC purpose in scenario where there is less space in DB server and cannot send the DB dump file to DB server because it is huge. And please do not down vote question. I have searched many forums and no where this is referenced. 

Thanks to the website $URL$ I have quoted the script and the details from the above site. After executing the script, I was able to execute the command 

I have created a kickstart file and pointed the location. But I am not able to proceed further. I have seen options telling you need to have a vnc console and proceed. But I am looking for a text only automatic installation. I am trying to install this over ssh, so vnc or console is not an option for me. Any help is much appreciated. 

Newbie alert, I'm in a bind but I'm not super familiar with MX record issues. We used to host our site with a custom hosting provider and recently switched to S3. We have our own authoritative DNS server, which sets our MX records 1,5,10s to the GMAIL domains. There is something missing from my understanding, as I thought this would be enough to keep continuity with email, but incoming emails are not coming in. We can send out but can't receive emails. I'm assuming it has something to do with mail.our_domain.com since it points to some random server. Do I need to get route53 involved since we are hosting with S3? 

I have a self-hosted authoritative DNS server, using MaraDNS. We're having smaller periods of unresponsiveness during peak times. I'm guessing because of this it has to do with MaraDNS not having enough resources. I want to monitor how many DNS requests it's getting, I can't seem to find anything that would log numbers of requests for a time (just full requests which seems like overkill). See maraDNS config reference, log_level. One thing I could do is: would get incoming traffic I believe, would keep the output to one line and simple. I don't know what the tcpdump will look like for getting a request. Then I'd just write 1's to a file and do a to see how many requests came in. Is there a better way? Is there other ways to monitor DNS systems with more granularity? Thanks! 

One of the clients I work for has a test@xxxx.com account. I believe it's an alias, and I got an email signing up for a random site (it's a legit site) presumably to test that someone had access to it. It had a confirmation link in it, and the same email ALSO got a 'confirmed' email from the same site. To me this suggests someone has successfully tested access to this email address. But how? What are some vectors people have? The company manages their own DNS service, and thus MX records. They point to google. What are some things I can do to debug this? I've already went on to check our MX records at $URL$ And everything there is a google.com or googlemail.com hostname. When searching for problems here is what comes up: 

I've set the Restore on AC/Power Loss from the windows Bios menu on computer startup for a few Windows machines. How can someone confirm (remotely) that I have done that, is there a way to do this from a remote desktop? Bonus points if you know how to change it remotely (if it can be done). What I've done: 

I have received a p7b file from my co-worker and he asked me to install it on one of our servers. It looks like p7b is same as .cert file. I looked up google to find out how to install the file and it looks like I also need to have .key file. Is it possible to make the key file with .cert or .p7b file? 

While I was talking with my co-workers few days ago, one of them mentioned that apache creates a thread per connection. What does he mean by per connection exactly? Let's say I have a HTML file that contains three images. When I access the file, my browsers request three images to a server. so...does apache make a thread for each images? 

So I have a main domaing pointing to my server (xx.xx.xx.xx). I tried to create a subdomain with the following virtualhost file. 

I'm having a little issue with video files. Apparently, for mobile videos, server should support byte range. The following is response headers from my video request. 

I looked up google then found out that Nginx can't read either the cert or key file. I opened the cert file and everything looked good. When I opened the key file then I realized it is a binary file. is this normal? I thought a key file is just a plain text file. 

My client sent me a CER file so I installed on my IIS. How do I verify that it has been installed correctly? The purpose of CER file is to access their SSL protocol. Is there a sample aspx file that I can use to test ? or is there a tool that IIS provides ? 

I'm trying to install a SSL with my nginx setup. I configured nginx with those two files, but it doesn't work. Nginx complained the following error message. 

I'm trying to read log files of Varnish server in Ubuntu environment. I actually never used Varnish before. so...I cd to /var/log/varnish, but the folder is empty. it tells me that I have to configure my varnish server to save logs...is that true? 

My co-worker sent me a '.ssh' directory with files in it. He said that I can put that directory in my user directory then connect to ssh without password (ssh root@ip). I put that directory in my home directory then tried ssh root@ip, but it didn't work. Am I missing something?
