Command language interpreter The command is the bourne shell. This is one, among several shells but is considered the old standard and generally one you can be certain exist. It's also common to see in many shell scripts. That declaration is specifying the shell to use as different shells use different syntax. As regards the flag, quoting : 

Everything within the is read as a string, you wouldn't need to figure out how to escape various quotation marks or worry about the shell interpreting something the wrong way. 

My employer in the US has asked me to obtain a static IP address to enable him lock down his servers to the general public, allowing just our IP addresses. The cost of obtaining an IP address here is alarming (over $600 USD). He's suggested that I setup a VPN or some other system to mask my public IP with a static one. I own quite a few devices that I connect to the internet. Can I setup a VPN at home or on a rented server and connect to the internet using the VPN network? Will doing this give me a permanent IP address? What options do I have? 

I added this () before in /etc/rc.local The above does NOT work, but it does work when run manually . I have also tried running this in a screen session using: . Any suggestions to get this working as desired? I need this application running after boot. 

Probably the easiest option would be to have it publish a snapshot every x minutes or hours to a website, which you could then control with some sort of password-based authentication. Accessing the camera directly will be much more difficult and probably not worth the hassle if all you need to do is check your mail. 

PDF Split and Merge is a tool I've had great success with, and it comes in GUI and command-line flavours. If the command-line version is anything like the GUI, you should have no problem scripting a solution. 

Yes - you can use Partition Magic or the like to do this. Defragmenting your drive first should give you a bit more space at the end of the drive to work with. 

It sounds like this is probably an accessibility 'feature', but I can't find anything specific about what you're experiencing on the page (here). I think you'll want to look along those lines, though. 

Most drives will not let you do this - but you should be able to use a program like VLC to get around the regions in software. 

See the question - if I want to build the latest version of an app from the source, am I doomed to checking for updates manually? Is there a better way to do this? 

They are backward compatible. But - since each version brings new functionalities with it, only the basic function set is backward compatible all the way, see the table for more detail. In addition to that 2 devices wanting to communicate using bluetooth have to support the same profile(s), the full piece that i copy/pasted from here. 

If nothing in the boot process changes: Motherboard...?! At this point the question you have to ask yourself is wether or not it actually makes sense to spend hours (eventually days) tracking down the problem, or wether it's better to build/buy a new system...obviously depends on wether this is purely private and fun/hobby or if you really need to get some work done and don't need this. Replacing a not so new Aspire L320 shouldn't cost a lot (especially in comparison to the hours spent trying to fix it). By the way: Continue posting your results as you try solving this, someone might have had the exact component/problem and can add to the issue. 

In that case go to the Snapshot manager and create a clone of your defined snapshot. The VM has to be turned off - the clone will then be your base vhd including your snapshot file (which only documents changes to base vhd). 

Usually, the derived work is just the piece (image) itself. If you're using other content from the page as well, then it would apply to the entire page. If your site is based around the image, you might have more trouble than if the image is just there to complement your existing content. Of course, it would be best to consult a lawyer. 

You'll probably have the best luck writing a script to do it yourself in the browser - I don't believe there's an option you can set within the system to specify this. 

What you're looking for is the Avant Window Navigator (awn) - the link has instructions for gutsy, but they should apply equally to new distributions as well! 

If you can copy all of the data into one sheet, you can use the 'remove duplicates' (under Data) to find unique addresses. If you colour-code the entries from each file first, you'll be able to tell which came from where, and which ones are left over. Edit: If you used background colours to code the entries, you can use this function to count the entries. If you coloured the font, you can use this function, taking care to replace 'Interior' with 'Font' as noted in the explanation at the top. 

It is important for these sources to reference specific versions of linux distributions. An example is trusty which is the codename for Ubuntu 14.04. You can query your OS (debian based) for complete details with or which means short and codename. In your question, the part is interpreted and the result from your operating system is printed into the custom source file ros-latest.list which the command will create upon execution. 

Package Management and Software Repositories Debian based Linux distributions rely on repositories (databases of application installation packages and upgrade packages) to keep the operating systems updated and also to easily fetch and install new software packages. The location of these repositories are stored in , however additional sources, usually unique to specific applications can be stored in the directory. When the package index update command is executed, your operating system checks with these package repositories for available packages and registers the available softwares as available to your operating system which you can go on to install using the traditional command. An example of one of these software sources is: 

I have scoured the web and tried numerous solutions. Nothing has worked for me so far, hence this question. I have a rails application that I run with . That command has to be run from the directory of the application, in this case "/var/myapp". This is the setup: /etc/mongrel.sh 

Screen brightness is the #1 thing I change. After that, any network service that's constantly polling for a connection is big - Bluetooth is a huge power hog (at least on my cell and notebook). 

No advertising and a ten-fold improvement in application startup time are my reasons. The plugins and themes with Pidgin are attractive, as well. 

I just keep a headphone jack adapter plugged in when I'm in public places, so the volume is effectively muted and there's no disturbance. 

Like Stefan mentioned, this is most likely a problem with each individual messaging application. Try installing a multi-protocol client like Pidgin and see if you have success with that - otherwise, take a look at the password storing options on each other app. 

Following these recommendations is a good start, though it really depends on your setup and what you want to do with the system every day. Disabling things like network discovery and any sort of software your printer might've come with is a good start as well, though if those are applications you use frequently, YMMV. 

I usually go for the queue-up-then-minimize approach, but out of the box I don't believe there's any other way to do it. 

Take a look at the Google documentation here for tips on setting up folders to handle deletion properly. The default behaviour for Outlook does what you want, though the iPhone will require different actions to do what you want (which are also outlined in the link). 

Standard: C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\ Fallback: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application 

The Problem lies in the fact that the WOL Function relies on an Ethernet Broadcast which solely goes by a MAC-Address (OSI Layer 2), not an IP (Layer 3). Trying to do this through a VPN-Connection will usually go wrong, with the following settings you can get around this: Setup Port-Forwarding in your Router with UDP Port 9 (WOL Layer 3 Pakets usually go by this port) on your local machine - don't forget to set static IP's since DHCP will jumble things up (eventually) also be careful, if you do have a dhcp range you want to keep alive, set static IP's outside this range. 

TP-LINK TL-R470T+ is an inexpensive option with 3 additionally configurable ports (wan/lan) although i don't have any experience in the setup of this kind of thing TP-LINK has always been a stable and quiet cheap solution. Edit: Since your main concern is stability, i would refrain from trying to build little DIY-Solutions. The configuration is generally much broader/deeper than using a router with this kind of functionality. In addition to that, you don't really want to be troubleshooting 10 components when the system breaks... 

The packetloss at your router will probably be an overloaded router dropping packets where normally an error packet would be generated. Try increasing the interval...see if there are changes. Beyond that the packet loss figures don't really mean anything to your connection with the destination ip. 

Honestly, I'd use GIMP with layers, and just export to .jpg if I needed a flat image. This would give you the history as well as more control editing, and isn't that much more work to maintain. 

If you're worried about RSI, a trackball is definitely the way to go. They're a little difficult to get used to, but you'll notice a difference really quickly. 

I usually use them to separate categories of tasks - all too often I find myself with an IM window open overtop of work, or e-mail popping up while I'm working on an assignment. I generally have all of my 'distractions' in one desktop and work in the other - that way I can switch between the two easily but not be interrupted when I need to focus. 

I've used SUPER and had good results, but some people are leery that it might be a bit suspicious (so, be careful and make you're you're only downloading from the developer's site). It's basically a front-end to the ffmpeg library, which can do anything and everything video-related. 

There's an app available here that will let you turn off the lcd on your notebook, but it 'wakes up' when you press a key or move the mouse. Likewise with this app. Perhaps one of those could be adapted to suit your needs, though? 

Windows + 0 - 9: You can select an existing Taskbar Item and maximize. Windows + Shift + 0 - 9: You create a new tab / instance of the Program selected. Windows + Alt + 0 - 9: You open the Right-Click Menu for that Taskbar Item. Beyond that there is no way to change the order with KB-Shortcuts. 

802.11g Bandwidth (net): 19MBit/s & Radius: ca. 38m 802.11n Bandwidth (net): 240MBit/s & Radius: ca. 70m So, doing anything in parallel like streaming data (device to device, not internet related)to other devices in your lan will see its limits very fast using 802.11g. Add to that the fact that 802.11n will give you a larger operating radius (think of all those corners of your home you want to get wifi in). Short answer: Yes, strong benefit. 

This can be due to a number of things, narrow the possibilities down by removing (where possible) the component and checking it for obvious faults. This is how i would do it: 

As mentioned "locking" C to a read only state wouldn't really work since applications (besides the system itself) will try to write to it and fail. If your only concern is Windows Updates - simply change the settings as above.
