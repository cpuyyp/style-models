It seems to randomly appear in any application, I'm using an ATI graphics card. Does anyone else experience this issue? 

I'll just check the year - yes indeed 2010! I'll try explain this quick - if you have less than 4GB's ram in your machine run a 32bit OS, if you have 4GB's or more then run a 64bit OS. Mostly ALL of your 32bit applications will work on a 64bit version of Windows. Most recent devices have 64bit drivers. The only drawback I can think of would be if you had a specific device that you don't have 64bit drivers for. 64bit computing is pretty much defacto lately, 32bit is dying out. Also I would question this friends motivations for hating 64bit computing, What exactly does he hate about it - the ability to use more than 4GB's of RAM, or the extra stability and slight speed increase of 64bit computing? Hating 64bit computing, is like hating "The Beatles" 

I'm using the latest version of msn messenger, and I communicate with friends who use Pidgin client on Linux. Is the transport text ssl encrypted? 

my disk has over 100GB of free space, but the usage bar in Computer is displayed in red, as if it reached a low space limit. It looks like Windows applies the same 10% or 15% hard disk space value for low space warnings, regardless of if the disk is 50GB in size or 1.5TB, which is not very smart and obsolete for most recent computers. Is there a Registry key or some place I can change this percentage so the usage bar displays in green, not red? The hibernation and page files are already reserved (5GB together), so surely the low space warning for a 1.5TB disk should be 5-10GB, not 150GB or more. The way Windows 7 computes the low space limit seems pretty dumb, not much Intellisense there. This is not a high priority issue, but it makes the Computer applet look pretty stupid and it's irritating every day to see that 100GB of free space is putting my computer in the red. It would also be nice to be able to edit this low limit percentage in Computer/Manage/Storage/Disk Management or directly in the disk properties ("Tools" tab). 

I am trying to connect to connect to www.czebox.cz using internet explorer on Windows 2003 server. If you have a server to test from please do, and you'll notice that it does not connect instead returns - Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage. From Firefox it works fine on the server. From Windows 7 it works fine in Internet Explorer. How can I get it to work in Windows 2003 Server using IE? 

has -C, --directory DIR: change to directory DIR. Does pax have something similar? This can be useful for backing up directory structures/hierarchies in a relative fashion, such as , instead of , or restoring from inside a directory other than $TARGET_DIR. I normally use pax in ustar (default) format, or sometimes cpio. 

It can be done with other tools, but I am interested to know how can I delete all but the last X lines of the file with . 

But authentication fails (assume "no password"). Because I am using the same server, it would be nice if just used the same credentials that I am currently using to log into the current server. But alas... Is there a way to use a password for command? Is there a better way to do this? I do not believe that is helpful here... If it helps, I believe that the SFTP server is a Windows box. 

edit: I want to extra and and directory contains directory with 20 files. I want to extract only member and and directory and copy them to another "remote_host" using ssh/scp. Can this be done as a one-liner? I considered using , , or but I guess I'm not very skilled with these utilities yet. 

I want to transfer directories and files under 'company?' non-recursively. This (so far) appears to do what I am after: 

I have an old IDE drive with windows 7 installed on it. I disconnected that drive, and installed a new windows 7 to a new drive (SSD). I want to extract data from the old drive. However, the problem I am having is, when the drive is connected to MoBo, windows wants to boot from this drive. The BIOS is crap, and doesn't allow me to arrage the order of the various hard drives on the system. I want to stop this drive from booting. Can I erase the booting information on its partitions, or on or near the MBR. I, like many people, struggle to repair the windows booting information, not destroy it. I know I "could" use an external enclosure to read its data. But this is a good way to learn something new. I am familiar with GNU/Linux, so if there is a known method of using it to solve my issue, that will be fine. Thanks 

I download all files in remote dir1/. They are downloaded to a directory which contains hundreds of files. I need to copy the file to a remote "archive" directory. I need to delete the file from dir1/ (above). 

Using vim (or vi) I want to align the sections with to the same column number. What's the easiest and fastest way to do this? (ignore the ugly bits for now) 

I was local/administrator , and had all my shortcuts, cookies, form fillers setup.... then I joined a domain... now I am domain/myUserAccount Is there a way that I can get my old user profile mapped to this new domain account login? Running Windows 7... Thanks 

I have a .mov file I've just recorded that's 600MB, I want to convert it to a smaller .mp4 file. How can I do this? 

I've got a DVD that I've burnt from an MSDN ISO. I'm not entirely sure if its Windows 7 64bit or 32bit. How can I be sure? 

Remember its not called a PC (Personal Computer) for nothing. Some people spend more time on a computer than others. Part of the whole lure of computers is the ability to explore. Mostly the average non geek user accepts the Windows interface as is, but geeks have been skinning since dos days (Ansi.sys). Windows XP is perhaps the easiest version of Windows to skin (check out Deviant Art). There is also a paid App called Window blinds. I know I'm discussing Skinning here - NOT shell replacement, but this is really the easiest way to change the look of your Windows installation. Stepping back in history to the days of Litestep, explorer used to be a beast of a process. Back then replacing the shell meant saving ram. Explorer was pretty top heavy until Windows 7, since then its been nicely redesigned. Along comes Windows 7 and every desktop on the planet looks the same. Sure there are themes, but these are just color variations on the same look. Windows 7 by default does not skin very well, sure you can hack some sys file to get it to skin, but there are a lot less usable skins for Win 7, than for XP. Some geeks are turning to Shell replacement just because they want diversity and more control. Microsoft don't provide this. Having said this, I will say that after trying a few shell replacements you get an appreciation for how well designed Windows 7 really is. I must say its a very good general purpose interface. I only wish it was easier to skin and more skins were available. 

I've noticed my windows directory takes up 21GB's of space. Normally I wouldn't mind because I'm usually on a hard drive with plenty of space, but since having purchased an SSD boot drive, I'm a bit limited as to what goes on the C:\ drive. Here is a detailed analysis of what is taking up that space: Size details for C:\Windows Name File Size Files % of Parent % of Total winsxs 7,010,870 42,338 30.8% 11.0% Installer 4,938,526 3,947 21.7% 7.7% assembly 3,336,223 3,191 14.7% 5.2% System32 2,713,797 11,860 11.9% 4.2% SysWOW64 1,259,757 4,973 5.5% 2.0% Microsoft.NET 1,147,614 3,951 5.0% 1.8% Anything in here that can be safely cleaned out? Log files or installer files? 

I'm trying to sync a large tree on Linux, but include and exclude certain files/directories. My question is regarding rsync's --relative option and how relative paths are handled. Directory structures appear something like: 

I'm having trouble finding a way to transfer a file from dir1/file to dir2/ using sftp protocol. I"ve tried because I need to provide password non-interactively, and public/private keys aren't available for me. 's is available, but it requires public/private key auth. I cannot use 's , , or . In the man page, seems promising: 

server1 has a filename.tgz and I need to copy it to server2. I would like to keep daily copies on server2, like: 

I installed Notepad++ 6.0 and the Explorer Plugin. When I right click a file in the side window, I don't get options for TortoiseSVN. When right clicking on a file in Windows Explorer, I do see options for TortoiseSVN. Any ideas on why this might be? 

I had to add a static route to my wireless router BACK to the 192.168.2.0/24 network via 192.168.1.103 (laptop). Now windows can browse web via lappy! SOLVED 

I'm trying to determine if sed is faster reading from stdin (with shell redirection < ) or by specifying the file from which sed should read. I didn't find a definitive answer on Google. Which is faster? 

dir1, dir2, and dir3 contain many directories that I do not want copied. Copy on the remote host to /dirB maintaining the same directory structure. I tried: 

I'm trying to copy the contents of a series of directories non-recursively to another remote system. 

try the Chrono extension for chrome. In Options there is a field which lets you change the simultaneous number of downloads. $URL$ 

I'm writing bash shell scripts with Unix line endings using notepad++. However, the final line never contains a new line. I must manually create it by pressing "enter" and having a blank line in my document. How can I configure Notepad++ to always have a newline (line feed) at the end of all lines? 

Puppet is a configuration management software which is capable of configuring a fleet of servers automatically by reading Puppet Manifests files. Such a file could include a definition of your /etc/sudoers file, which can then be pushed out to all your puppet "agents" from your puppet "master". Then all hosts will get the same copy of your /etc/sudoers file, which can (and should) include HOST definitions, so you can grant some users some commands on some hosts (but not on others). 

I have been reading the rsync man page, but I'm not clear on whether I should use the --backup-dir option or the --copy-dest option I'll have a command similar to 

I have 2 laptops connected on my home network,which is connected to a wireless router, router has an ADSL modem, which connects to my 8mbps phone DSL connection. One of my laptops is really in cable range of the router, but both laptops at the moment are connected via wireless. Do you think it makes sense to connect up the laptop that is in cable range, to the router using a LAN cable? Is the latency between having a cable connection going to be much better and noticable, than if I connect via wireless? What are your thoughts? Thanks 

I want to send someone a form in a document, have them fill it in and send it back to me. What is the best document format that can handle this? 

Recently I installed an SSD drive, its now my primary boot drive (OCZ Vertex Turbo 60GB). I'm running Win 7 (64bit). Now I am not sure exactly where the fault lies, but when I do a restart from within Windows, the computer will boot and enter into the loading windows portion, however won't progress beyond there. My solution is to manually hit the reset switch, and then when it boots it enters into a windows menu that offers a start up repair or start windows normally. I select start windows normally, and then it boots fine. I am not entirely sure why I can't just restart the computer from windows normally though. The SSD drive works perfectly, and not even sure if it is the cause to this problem. Any ideas on this? 

I'm in the mood for removing bloat. Stuff like DVD maker and this nifty little tool called Math input panel. I just don't have a use for it. Is there anyway to uninstall it? 

I've just installed an SSD as primary boot drive. During install, a system reserved partition was allocated (not very big) around 100MB. Problem is the drive is visible in explorer and its assigned to D: Anyone else had this problem, and is there a way to somehow hide that drive from explorer, and also get back the drive letter assignment? Thanks 

I have a Logitech clearchat headset that runs on 2.4Ghz wireless frequency. I'm thinking of getting a Logitech Desktop Wave Wireless, also running on the 2.4Ghz frequency. Will I be able to use keyboard, mouse and headset without interference? 

I'm a huge fan of TFS and VS2010, but I work in a company where the source control solution is SVN, it is unlikely to change because all our customers are also using SVN. Having said that I'm also a huge fan of SVN. I would however like to be able to handle stuff like TFS team functionality and project tracking in visual studio using SVN and not Team foundation server. Is this possible with some plugin?
