I can decide - problem most probable in routing from A to C (on A node) Checking routing tables Im found incorrect route to BC network. 

Any router that can build L2 VPN between them solve this problem. Better to be able to filter L2 traffic to solve problems with unnecssary broadcast/multicast flood and add flexibility. 

To survive VPN server IP change, on Pi use dns name to connect rather IP. Buy domain, or use some free domain (many dynamic dns there, but hard to advice). (Personally I as Mikrotik consultant, prefer cheap USB powered RB. Prise is comparable to Pi. But Pi more flexible and it Your choose.) 

In ring topology RSTP is much better. STP in ring topology can enter in infinite topology rebuilding. RSTP in linux supported as rstpd daemon, but Im not sure it well supported and newer configure in in generic Linux. In Linux kernel based RouterOS, RSTP work perfectly. 

How many devices need to be connected? If not too, crazy solution to connect network cards directly by patch-cord. But PTP require ultra low jitter, rather latency time. What with network adapter buffers. 

AP can handle multiple SSID and bridge it to different VLANs to separate traffic of SSIDs. And router handle different VLANs with correct rules. AP can make some kind of L2 tunnel to central device (wireless controller or roouter). 

In practice. If operator deliver SMS only over GSM network, but not over 3G network and support 3G for data transfer. Some 3G phones connect only by "better" 3G protocol and cant recieve sms quickly. Until it switch to lover protocol because of low signal or no 3G coverage. Possible it related with operator network misconfiguration or bug in phone software or both in combination. 

bandwidth or throughput is / where implied - data is received by destination and frequently implied - data is application data (at least L2 or upper) All protocol overhead count there. transmission rate or bitrate is similar, but data just transmitted but no warranty on receiving by destination. And it not count protocol overhead. It L1 speed. 

In theory is possible to use link-local IPv6 as gateway address, but IPv6 link-local accessible only from local subnet (it nonroutable), so then how to access equipment for management over IPv6 form other subnets? 

If You don't have public IPv4 on the server and can't get IPv6 from ISP, then You can get IPv6 for Your LAN from IPv6 tunnel broker (search any working) 

It depends on l2tp setup. If it use BCP (Bridge Control Protocol) PPP extension, then l2tp works like Ethernet (forward L2 frames), so your first assumption is right. If it plain l2tp (which forward L3 packets only) it forwarded by routes or by combination of routes and arp manipulation (Arp Proxy or some other), then your second assumption is right. 

I connect SG-300 into a port of VLAN 20. VLAN 20 assigns it an IP address 10.10.2.3 by DHCP. I connect a third laptop into one port of SG-300 switch. It got an IP address 10.10.2.4 automatically (I did not do any configure on SG-300, a new switch) laptop 10.10.2.4 can ping 10.10.1.2 successfully. laptop 10.10.1.2 can ping 10.10.2.3, but cannot ping 10.10.2.4, which is behind SG-300 switch. 

I have read the tutorials about how to send several command lines to setup port mirroring (e.g. source port, destination port). But before sending commands to the switch, I need a administration interface, such as cmd window, or web management platform. Hence, where I can access that admin interface? For example, for cisco Catalyst 2960 Series switch. From the destination port connected computer/laptop? Then connect the switch's IP? 

There is a switch-based LAN without encrypted traffic. I want to sniff ALL its traffic (ARP, TCP, ICMP, etc.) by plugging the laptop into one of the switch port. Then run the software on the PC to sniff the network traffic. Of course I will provide an authorized IP address to my laptop. It is an authorized test in lab environment. How can I do the sniffing? What sniffing software should I use? 

As what I know, an open TCP scan is just a normal TCP 3-way handshake followed by RST. It is detectable because the target will log this connection. For the half-open TCP scan, it is defined as "stealth". The explanation is that only a SYN packet is sent, which is also a 3-way handshake. But these two seems same. I do not find what are the true difference? 

I have a Cisco 2960-X switch and a Cisco SG-300 switch. I created VLANs on 2960-X switch (e.g. VLAN 10 with ports 1-5 and VLAN 20 with ports 6-10) and allow DHCP for each VLAN. Now, laptop 10.10.1.2 and laptop 10.10.2.2 can ping each other successfully. After this: 

I am configuring a firewall hardware, which is connected between my laptop and lab LAN (lab LAN is also connected to other computers as well as Internet). My objective is to allow the ping between my computer & another computer in the lab. Then test deny the ping function. To ping successfully, I must allow all necessary protocols that related to "ping" by setting firewall configuration GUI. I have tried to allow several protocols together that related to ping, such as ARP, ICMP. However, "ping" is unsuccessful. I think the problem is that some protocols that support "ping" are not listed and allowed in the configuration. Is it correct? Then what protocols I need to add as well? 

For example, in Windows OS, the TCP window size always change around 30000~60000 (of course, max 65535). The objective of window size is to inform the TCP sender and receiver, and improve the packet transmission efficiency. I heard that some OS (e.g. solaris) always use fixed window size. Then why not Windows OS always keep the window size at max 65535 or a large value? What determine the window size and always change it? 

If You need all nodes to work in one subnet and one L2 broadcast domain, add bridge interface, enable rstp on it, assign IP on bridge interface and add physical interfaces to bridge. /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0 

Overlapped subnets is unnecessary clutter configuration, making some implications (different subnets communicate on L3 only and through router) wrong. For example: In logs on host PCA we see connection from IP 192.168.1.3. This IP belong to what subnet? It same risk as place two non overlapped subnets in one L2 segment (broadcast segment). hosts really can communicate in L2 by using non IP protocol or by tweaking IP configuration (add static route to other subnet over interface). 

By using managed switch with VLANs and AP that support VLANs. Or by using AP and Wireless controller that tunneling traffic between them. Cost of solution can differ depends on chosen equipment. But anyway radio planning and cabling planning is required, specially if You planning to use multiple APs. UPD. Try to make more specific in project. 1. How many AP is necessary? One AP can work from 10 to 100 meters, depends on AP, Wi-Fi standard (g ,n ,ac), walls, desired speed, AP antennas and other parameters. Reinforced concrete make good isolation, so at least 1 AP on floor. One of way is set test AP and try, how far from it phone work acceptable. 2. How many active users must be served simultaneous? (active mean do something on network or internet) In 2.4 GHz band only 3 channels simultaneous possible. And more 15-20 active users on single channel in single interference area can make problem with performance. If it problem meet, use low power AP that have less coverage and less interference area, and possible use directional antennas. But then more AP required. And/OR use 5 GHz band where more channels can be used (8 - 12 depends on country), if enough client devices support it. If not, You can try use long range higher power AP. 3. Where it must be placed? There some different solution possible. It somehow like box packaging. Some AP can have directional antennas and make far coverage in one direction and short in other. It can depend on wiring limitation (maximum 100 meters of twisted pair) and on AP choose. 4. What AP you choose? Hard question. For example: Ubiquiti UniFi is nice, but requite controller (PC software or "UniFi Cloud Key"). And if one or more switch is used it must be VLAN capable managed switch. And there no directional AP that support multiple SSID (if not do reflash to non native firmware). Mikrotik - any wireless can be controlled AP or work without controller. Any router can be wireless controller (limited only by planned load). More flexible router, for my taste (but less trivial). Meraki, Ruckus, Aruba ... - can do anything of above and much more, but several times more expensive. And I lack expertise in it. 5. What router to use? How much traffic must handle the router? (In Your case - What planned speed of internet connection plus estimation of inter-VLAN traffic?)
