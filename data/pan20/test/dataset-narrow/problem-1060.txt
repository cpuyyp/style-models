So you'd want those two sed -i lines. For a GUI alternative, you could look at powergrep or free alternatives. These methods also allow for regexes though you aren't really using them for this simple search and replace. 

You just made up that term in your subject didn't you? You mean WZC - the Windows Zero Configurator. It's built in wireless client software. There isn't any generic one I know of other than that one. You should try specifically the wireless client software for your network card. And make sure that the WZC service isn't running.. so services list it as stopped and so you can't view wireless networks with WZC. So they're not clashing. You're not meant to use both, apparently they can clash. And software i've tried turns WZC off automatically. It's not a question of "replacing it", it doesn't get replaced. If neither work then you should consider that maybe the wireless client - card in this case -has a problem. Also there are different standards that use different frequencies, specifically the standards are called 802.11 b/g/n so check which your router is sending out (b/g/n), some can send out more than one. And check which your card receives. a link found via google, is within downloadcenter.intel.com Intel® PROSet/Wireless Basic Enterprise Software for Windows XP 32-​Bit* Drivers and management software for Microsoft Windows XP 32-bit OS*. OS: Windows XP* they can call it what they want, but use a generic technical term. So that's the wireless client software for your card.. hopefully 

Produces a 4s 26ms file. Close to 4s, as it should be. This site $URL$ mentions -acodec libvorbis I get 4s 3ms with that which is even better. Whereas if I did it with acodec copy and vcodec copy it'd be just over 5 seconds. So specifying those codecs for mp4 and not using 'copy' solved it. 

This answer is corrected in my comments too. it probably wouldn't work 'cos DHCP is on both by default. You don't want that. You could turn DHCP off the second router. You want all IPs on your network to be in the same subnet. DHCP on both is fine there's no clash, because the DHCP from the isp gateway will not go past the linksys WRT54G to its LAN side. DHCP on the isp gateway is useful though it'd only be sending to one device, so no worries if you can't turn it off on the isp gateway, it still even has its use. And on the linksys WRT54G it's very useful for sending to each of your computers. So no good if one device is 192.168.0.1/24 and another is 192.168.1.1/24 or 10.0.0.1 You do want that situation, devices on the LAN side of the linksys WRT54G to be on a different subnet to the one on the WAN side. That's with NAT on. And I have heard that without NAT on it loses other functionality and becomes just a switch. So it's not great either way in that with NAT on both you'll have double NAT just means port forwarding can be more work to do. With NAT off on the linksys, you may lose functionality you want and then have no need for the linksys at all. Ideally you want to turn NAT off on the isp gateway, maybe use a different router/modem to your ISPs if it can't do it. (Some ISPs try to force you to use theirs with testing the MAC address but some router/modems will apparently let you set the MAC manually or clone it from another device, and get around that. You mentioned not having internet access. You can have internet access with double NAT it won't cause a problem there. It's just a bit more work with port forwarding if you want to run servers, and you're reliant on 2 things working and being configured right, rather than one when doing port forwarding. typical working examples would be, you might have a router of 192.168.0.1 , a computer of 192.168.0.2 another computer of 192.168.0.3 or another working example , you might have a router of 192.168.1.1 , a computer of 192.168.1.2 another computer of 192.168.1.3 if a device connected to your router is not on a recognized subnet e.g. simple situation is the same subnet of the device.. Then I don't think that device will get online.. Have one router doing DHCP(handing out IPs) to all other devices. And don't have 2 routers doing DHCP or they'll clash while doing it. Just so you're aware of the options, if however you did turn NAT off on your linksys WRT, then it'd be a switch and lose router functionality, and then if you still wanted to use it, you may not have a useful use for it, but if you still wanted to use it, then you'd want all devices in the same subnet, either set statically or DHCP done by just one device (presumably the isp gateway), DHCP from 2 devices would clash. And with DHCP from the isp gateway it'd reach all of them, would go through your linksys WRT54G and to your computers. If it was your linksys WRT54G doing it, it'd go to all too. That's with NAT off on your linksys. 

You can try running the Windows 7 restore installation. It starts its run from within Windows 7. I guess that should restore them. You can try taking a fresh Windows 7 installation e.g. from a virtual machine, and copying the contents of the registry keys over, where the environment variables are stored. win7 machine/system variables 

Your line failed because it expanded the line variable $line, and executed it which writes an error to stderr and nothing to stdout. All the $ with different meanings are a bit funny looking. But if you did(at the prompt of $) Then you get command not found. And if you do then you see nothing there. So it's piping nothing to grep and finding nothing. So, you need to echo the line variable, rather than run it like it's a command. 

re your title - both, - and it can handle more reads than writes. You can get stats on how many reads it can take and how many writes it can take. Good to back it up. In theory some rogue or bad software on the TV could write something on some media plugged into it, but it has probably never happened before. If a computer has a bad power supply then it can potentially damage components, so in theory a TV built badly could break a usb stick but you'd be hard pressed to find any example somebody has proven has happened though it could even in practise. In practise it wouldn't write i don't think 

This example, the directory c:\prc\a\fa has a file called file1, and subdirectories a,b,c,d The line that says for /f ......... will do it if you remove the word echo 

see if that gives any text.. If so good.. make sure your windows firewall or other firewall isn't blocking it.. do ipconfig or right click your network connection and click status..support and get the IP suppose it's 192.168.0.11 Go to another computer on your network and do see if you get the same text. If so good. Now do the port forwarding in your router. Then do the online port scan on port 21. That should work so port 21 comes out as open. But as for getting FTP running, there are issues like passive FTP and active FTP. I'm not that familiar with that. 

For troubleshooting / understanding what is going on, it's worth trying (or whatever path it is) to see if it even allows you to use mark's key and whether it works when doing that. And as a test try renaming root's key see what it does then! Also, (forgetting -i) see if there is a file ~/.ssh/config if so if it has anything in it. And see if there is a line in /etc/ssh_config that might be specifying root's key. 

that's all secondary storage. The books basically call hard disk drives secondary storage.. probably optical disk drives they'd call secondary storage. And they call RAM primary storage. 

If I was testing cygwin's sed i'd run it from the cygwin window as that's where cygwin programs are meant to be run. And then i'd use single quotes. msys seems similar to cygwin in that sense. UPDATE You can run cygwin's sed from cmd, or from cygwin. They behave different because they are different GNU versions, but I don't see any shell related issue running from cmd vs running from cygwin (other than the simple point about single quotes for cygwin 'cos eg bash, and double quotes for cmd). And cygwin's is a much later version of sed. Gnuwin32's sed, like many gnuwin32 things including gnuwin32 grep, is years out of date. and e.g. later greps can fix bugs in earlier greps. The 2009 sed that gnuwin32 uses, or less up to date version that gnuwin32 uses, may be ok but may be better to use a recent version that cygwin would use. Interestingly, the seds behave differently regarding backslash.. I can see how to get it working in the later sed, the sed that cygwin uses. 

The paragraph you read about "really nasty malware" and hiding and "very difficult to delete" is kind of correct, but is non-technical and silly. Any malware could be in a system restore. nasty or not so nasty. Just like any software could be put in there though if it was put in there and not as part of the creation of the restore point, then it probably would be malicious ! And system restore is not difficult to delete, it gets deleted as soon as you disable system restore.. it gets cleared when you disable and enable it. It is difficult with say rmdir or windows explorer, but it's easy to delete when you know how. Also, your objection regarding the checksum, doesn't work even in theory.. suppose malware gets into system restore.. Say it's some malicious program files that will get returned in dangerous places by a system restore, along with registry changes causing them to start. If there was a file with a checksum, well it could rewrite that too. So tada it matches! what malware does in practice tends to be display adverts, send data out about your browsing habits.. stealing bank details if you use online banking.. and in theory anything software can do. and if you speak about checksums then you really should know they don't stop something being modified. they just let you test it afterwards. 

So setting it to "none" (right click the table..table properties..the table tab - as in that image above, then click none under text wrapping), fixes that, so as to get the second table below 

A virus is just one type of malware(malicious software), another type is a trojan horse, another is a worm. A virus is a malicious program that makes copies of itself and hides itself in other programs., and if that's not malicious enough, sometimes they do more than that like delete everything on a certain date. A trojan horse is malware that once it infects a computer, allows somebody else to connect to the infected computer remotely and control it and other bad things, could delete files or open and close your cd drive. A worm is malware that sends copies of itself over a network, infecting computers that way. 

Check that DATE /T on your computer gives it in this format and with the number part in the form MM/DD/YYYY That's a requirement for the 2 FOR statements to work. On my computer, DATE /T gives 

I should point out, that bat file that adds a line, works non-destructively. So a.a is still the same. If you wanted a.a to be changed, you could do to output the results of the batch file to a new file then copy it onto a.a. Here is another version of the batch file that also works.. this time though I do copy a3.bat and a2.bat give the same result. and for the copy, I used copy /y, so that it won't ask to overwrite the file. so running a2 >b.b or a3>b.b means the results go to b.b Then copy /t b.b a.a and it overwrites the original a.a file 

Stage 1- Get DOS running in virtualbox.. Get a C prompt Stage 2- Get DOS SHELL(DOS's classic file manager) on there. For Stage 1 Download an MS DOS image.. I downloaded MSDOS 6.22 

Emails are sent to user@domain MUA is the email client. It'd be the SMTP client. (or maybe more accuraetly, a user interface configured to run a particular SMTP client which is of course local to that machine but of course, connects to an SMTP Server) MSA is an MTA meaning it transfers the email, but it's the MTA that the MUA connects to. And it's on the local domain. It would run SMTP. It'd be an SMTP server. (possibly there are other protocols it could run as alternatives to SMTP). MTA is an MTA at the destination domain. MDA Is a computer on the domain of the recipient, that writes/"delivers" the message into the "mail store" which is on a hard drive that computer has access to. Often local to it. That mail store, stores mail for users on the domain. MAA and MRA - These are to do with receiving email, rather than sending email out. The term MAA is less well known, and often people refer to the MRA as just the IMAP/POP client, and don't give the server an abbreviation. I've heard of the MRA being a term for both client and server, the argument being that it says agent, so just describes a function and the definition doesn't limit itself to just client or just server. But sites that use the term MAA seem to define the MAA as the server and MRA as the client, and maybe they're right. So i'll go with that, and quote from two websites on that, for a definition and an example. There is the MAA which is a POP/IMAP server. And the MRA which is the POP/IMAP client. Two links that mention this.. 

I'm going to add a general answer re windows freezing To test that it really is a freeze, look at the clock in windows, it shows minutes not seconds, so give it a few minutes so as to make sure the clock is still, so you know it's not a keyboard/mouse issue. Or an alternative test could be to try plugging in the keyboard/mouse again or into a different socket. If you've already had a freeze and tested to make sure it is a freeze then you can be more sure it's a freeze and not a keyboard and mouse issue.. If it is keyboard/mouse, it's unlikely to be both keyboard and mouse, so be sure to try both before concluding that it is a freeze. A computer freezing can be quite time consuming to solve so you want to be sure it is freezing! if you are getting freezes, a thing to do is to look at event viewer for clues. here's an image of the window $URL$ in event viewer you often want to expand window logs and go to "system" Look for red Xs and particularly any events that come at the same time as the crash. Also look in windows logs..applications (select that on the left hand side in event viewer).. again look for events that came at the same time as the crash. Make sure Windows is set to write a memory dump when there's a crash. Not a huge memory dump..(not a complete mrmory dump), But either a "small" or "kernel" one.. kernel might be better than small.. but if kernel turns out to be too big then use small. There is a setting to tick for that. $URL$ And you see the path to the dump file. So as long as that's set then next time it freezes, it will make a dump file. You can zip if it's a bit big, and then go here. They accept up to 40MB upload. $URL$ click the "choose file" and "upload" buttons to upload it and see the results. Another thing to do is to check the hard disk A)look at SMART data B)run a hard drive manufacturer tool for checking the hard drive. The software is often small and often runs in windows (not needing to make a bootable cd/usb) and often has options for quick tests(not needing hours). Another thing one can try is testing RAM The easy way is if you have more than one e.g. you have two RAM modules. So you run the computer with one RAM module, then see if it freezes. Then try running it with just the other RAM module. The slots are labelled DIMM0 DIMM1 DIMM2 you'd see with a torch or MBRD manual. So just use the first slot, DIMM0 when you have one RAM module in there. Another way, but is long, and perhaps pointless, is running memtest86 overnight 10 hours or so, and seeing if it shows any errors. If so then the thing is it doesn't tell you whnci module. So you'd have to run it again with each module. And you'd have to make a bootable CD or USB for it. So for RAM testing, better is the easier way, to try running the comp with one module, for RAM testing, and then the other, rather than memtest86.
