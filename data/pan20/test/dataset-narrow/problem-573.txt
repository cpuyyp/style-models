I see one thing I would consider a minor quirk: the usage of when the includes a return, exit, break or continue statement. I expect statements to be used when you don't want both branches of the code, not when both branches of the code cannot run. Changing those statements to just bare statements will allow you to seperate them from the prior condition and, IMO, make the code a bit more readable. 

First off, it's not a stored procedure, it's a view. That said, the main change I would make is to use a CTE, once you have upgraded. 

You basically have two values, that have a one to one coorespondences. I would take advantage of that. One value is what you want to return, the other value is the distinct value you get by using your 4 (5?) booleans as a bit pattern. Here's an example of creating the mapping programatically. It is for illustration purposes only, I don't recommend using it -- better to either put the map into a config file or a database. 

A couple of things that I haven't seen others mention. One is that access modifiers are not security. You should want to control who creates your object, not because you don't want someone creating it when they shouldn't, but because they shouldn't HAVE to know how to create your object -- whether the "someone" is a fellow developer, a class that you are writing or even you while working on another class, that knowledge is a burden you don't want them to bear. Secondly, as others have mentioned, the way to do this is to create a nested inner class. What I haven't seen others mention, perhaps thinking it too basic, is how do you let others interact with your inner class -- and the answer is to create an interface. 

To let several objects respond to the same commands. This lets you have a function where one of the parameters can be an object, but it doesn't have to be of a particular type. To allow an object in one assembly, to use an object in another assembly, without having the first assembly rely upon the second. Instead, both rely upon a third assembly, which defines the interface. In this case there MIGHT only be one object that implements the interface. One reason for doing this would be to avoid circular dependencies. 

Stylistic comments. You have a class, it has a public static main method and a public static method fizzBuzz. They do exactly the same thing. After moving the calculation out into it's own method, I would eliminate the fizzBuzz method, at that point it's just a loop and a println, well within what I would consider acceptable for main to be doing, and just as importantly, acceptable for another class to do if it wants to take advantage of your class. Main is as "pure" as it needs to be, it exercises the capability of the class in a simple straightforward manner. 

None of the other answers touch upon this... Your main function does too much. Specifically, the main function should ONLY do your initial validation -- do you have the right number of parameters? If possible verify that those parameters are valid. Then call a method that does the actual work. Code reuse, whether that is done via copy/paste, inheritance or a library, works best when you have discrete methods, that have little to no dependencies. In addition, given your usage I would change your writelog function to TryWriteLog and have it returns success or failure (ie it eats any exceptions and then returns an appropriate boolean). Exceptions should be handled at the earliest point that knows what to do in order to recover or continue. Given that you aren't doing anything with it, handling it in the logging function makes the most sense. 

The two options are not really two options as they are not mutually exclusive. You should prefer two for things that are tied closely with foo and need to be checked everytime that foo is done, you should use one where it is not always applicable to foo, but it is under these circumstances. IOW if all code paths include a check for x immediately before calling foo, and foo would break or take an incorrect action if x was incorrect, then put the check in foo, if on the ther hand, it is only checked 4 out of 5 times, then obviously it doesn't belong in foo. An additional consideration is whether foo is being called to return a result or to take an action. If to return a result, then you may be just changing one check at the call site for another, in which case it depends upon the check -- which makes more sense. 

This is totally unnecessary on the %3 and number branch as those can never be executed when %25. It is also unnecessarily long. 

Why is this a static method? While the sql connection string is generally either going to be injected or a dependency, the user name seems likely to be a property of the object. Not a big issue, and in context it could be the right thing. Disposable objects should generally be wrapped in a using block -- unless there is a need for the object to be used after the function is done, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Why are you doing validation in a method called Get...? That should either be done in the database, or after this method. You return an empty string in the case of validation error and null on an exception. You do nothing with your exception handling except return an error -- no logging, no report to the user. You catch an exception at the first point you know what to do to recover from the error -- since this function doesn't do anything with the string it retrieves, how does return null; recover from the error? 

Not really recommending this, but you could use the fact that you are always using both variables to generate a string representaion of the four states, and then have either a dictionary or switch statement return the correct value.
