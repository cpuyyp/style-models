If your ftp server supports FXP, ie, Server to Server File Transfers, you could use an FXP compliant ftp client to initiate the server-to-server file transfer. This would let the client tell server A to send a file to server B. Not too many servers support this, primarily because you have one server process trying to open a direct connection to the other server process, and many servers prevent this for security reasons. Hope that helps! 

My hunch is that FileZilla is taking the File Modification Date & Size of File on the server and is then comparing those attributes to the local file modification date & size of local file, and if there is a discrepency, it's prompting for confirmation. This action is configurable, go under Edit -> Settings -> Transfer -> File Exists Action in FileZilla and choose the default action when this happens. You can also submit a question to FileZilla directly in their forums, $URL$ Hope that helps! 

I'd say that it depends on the computer. Bluray readers are not directly connected to the video output on a computer. The bluray acts as a storage device, storing an encoded video. Since the stored, encoded video will not change, the computer is likely to decode the video to the same pixels each time you play a bluray. So you would expect the output to be the exact same every single time you do so. But depending on the current workload the computer has to deal with, it may or may not keep up with de decoding process. The video output might experience stuttering or screentearing. Sometimes ever artifacts when a GPU has been overclocked too much or some hardware is failing. Some video's are encoded with an algorithm that makes it possible to define a decode 'quality'. This means the software will choose a quality based on usersettings and the amount of work the CPU or GPU can handle. HDMI often supports an audio output, and audio is very likely to put through some equalizing and possibly some other filters. This is done with all kinds of algorithms. Even though you might expect the exact same binary signal, it could appear otherwise. I think it's very unlikely to measure the same signal twice, but I'm not saying it's impossible.. 

Pano (unfortunately no more supported) and All In Tabs Helper integrate themselves with All in One Sidebar as you wish. 

Your idea is fine for me. You can set up a table in an empty sheet where first column lists parameter meaningful names, and each one of the successive columns contains a different parameter value set. Then, on the "bunch calculation" sheet you set up a unique cell to choose a column of the table in the other sheet, and in the cells containing parameters you have to define a formula that using INDEX function retrieves the right value from the parameters table. So, changing the value of only one cell you realize istantly a whole different calculation without having to select a different sheet. 

Try to unplug all your USB devices, repeating the steps you took to create the sound. Now one by one plug them back in and keep checking if that device caused the problem. Another way might be to take a look at the 'safely remove hardware' menu via the tray icon before and after the sound. 

When I do not create a keyboard event (i.e. pressing or releasing a key) for more than 5 seconds, the numlock and other LEDs on my keyboard go off. When I'm holding a key for more than 5 seconds and the keyboard 'shuts down', I also hear the device disconnected sound in Windows 8.1. I've never had this until I got this new keyboard, a "microsoft wired keyboard 200". My USB mouse still seems to work properly even when the keyboard shuts down. It's really annoying because I can't hold any key (including Shift or Backspace) for more than a few seconds and I constantly see the LEDs flashing. When I press or release a button, the keyboard will go on instantly again, but when it's done by releasing a key, the "release event" will not be sent to the PC, causing the key to be "stuck" while it actually isn't pressed. This is solved by pressing it again. Does anyone know a solution for this problem? 

I'm just switched from XP to Seven. I have transferred my Firefox and Thunderbird profiles to my old XP pc to my new Seven pc. Firefox and Thunderbird work as expected, apart that with Thunderbird now when I click on a url inside a message text nothing happens, while before the browser window was loaded and the url page opened. What could be the problem source? 

You can format columns to unlock cells which are user-input, and then set conditional formatting for columns in your table specifying the formula condition =CELL("protect", ) as condition. Or you can set the following udf: 

Don't confuse data structure with data analysis. Your data have four variables: name, date, stock, price, which together represent a single unit-block and so the natural way to organize them is: 

Yes, the /D swtich for CD will change the drive and then change the current working directory. This works with both drive letters assigned to local drives and also to network drive letters mapped to network UNC shares or remote storage servers via programs like ExpanDrive or WebDrive. More information on the MSDOS CD command can be found at $URL$ 

This sounds like an ISP issue to me with high latency. Try running pingtest.net to see what type of latency you get to various servers. 

You can also try Crush FTP Server (www.crushftp.com), which supports WebDAV and runs on Windows and other platforms, it's very simple to set up and should do the trick. If you are looking for something more beefy, you can try Cornerstone MFT (www.cornerstoneMFT.com). Disclaimer...I work for this company. If you are still running into problems after setting up the WebDAV server, make sure your Windows Firewall has opened port 80 to incoming traffic. You may also need to whitelist the WebDAV server process as a process that's allowed to access the Internet. Usually the WebDAV server will listen on multiple IP addresses, LocalHost and then your generic IP address which most likely is something like 192.168.1.x or 192.168.2.x. The localhost address is your 'loopback' address and you can use that locally from the same Windows box to test to make sure the WebDAV server is working. The loopback address will bypass the firewall. Launch your WebDAV client and go to http ://localhost/ If that works, then try your IP address http ://192.168.1.x/ to verify that the WebDAV server is listening on an IP address that is accessible from other computers. The 192.168.1.x address will not bypass the firewall and this will let you know if the firewall is a problem. Then go to another computer, or your Mobile device, and use the 192.168.1.x address and you should be able to get to your WebDAV server. If you can't then it's most likely a Windows Firewall issue. Hope that helps! 

Put "Elementary", "Middle School", "High School", "" in B1:B4. Then, assuming that your list is in column J and you want the processed list in column K, input the following formula in K2 confirming with Ctrl+Shift+Enter and copy down. 

Obviously when you have to summarize your data in a 2x2 table, you have to choose which variable titles the rows, which one titles the columns and which one gives values. But remember: first comes data structure, then come summary tables. Are you interested in brand price trend? Build a table Name x Date with cells containing price values. Are you interested in brand stock trend? Build a table Name x Date with cells containing stock values. 

Is it possible to download (preferably: one-way sync, so also delete) a network folder, for instance to a local folder like if available, otherwise leave it the same. I want to listen to my music on my laptop, which is stored on the NAS, while I'm at home. But when I'm not home, I still want the most recent music library with me. Is there any way of achieving this in Windows 8.1? The NAS (server, rather) is running Ubuntu Server 12.04, but I'm guessing that doesn't matter.. Thanks in advance! 

But when I finish this setup and I go back to Windows (even after reboot), the settings remain the same. Even in Windows Explorer: 

The problem with the (good) solution which uses OFFSET is that if you add a column (not a row) then your formula will not work anymore. In plain words, in this case OFFSET protects you from the add of a row but not from an add of a column. An alternative is to use the following formula in D3 which you can copy as many times as you want below: 

If the images are in jpg format, it is possible that your client uses a viewer which rotates images according to orientation field in exif data. 

You have to use VBA to accomplish your goal. Feel free to modify the routine below, which colors the background of the current cell, according to your needs. 

It's some kind of glitch in the syncing process (maybe something got corrupted?). I'm not sure but some people have been able to fix it by toggling the 'sync automatically' button and sync their iDevice. Possibly repeat once or twice. If that doesn't work, try duplicating the file or importing it again to iTunes (copy it from iTunes Media if it's there). Another issue might be that the file of the song is corrupted. Try to identify the file and see if you can play it with any other music player. If not, delete it from there and download, rip or buy the song again.
