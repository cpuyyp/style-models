File don't have owner and group saved as names in their metadata, but as UID and GID. If the OS cannot resolve those IDs to names, they show the ID as is. The resolving process uses to know where to look. (file, ldap, database, etc.) I suppose that will not return anything, meaning the group doesn't exist. If it doesn't that mean this group doesn't have GID 999 which explains why your file show bogus. Use to modify its GID. 

What you are looking for is netstat with the switch, as in "listen". What we usually call an "open port" is actually a listening socket on which a program is bound. It can be on any interface (0.0.0.0:port) or interface-specific (127.0.0.1:port for 'loopback'). When a program is bound to this socket, the kernel allows packets destinating there and forwards them. If no program is bound on the said socket, the packet is dropped. hence the "open/closed" terminology. You may anlso want to use the switch to prevent netstat from transforming port numbers and host addresses in to their respective names. To do the test remotely, please have a look at the command. 

Bob on the chat suggested to use a subshell, including sleep between two echoes. This works like a charm : 

run the command and acknowledge the absence of answer after it timed out look for the key in authorized_keys files and find it Postpone the publickey method (explained here) retry the AuthorizedKeysCommand and time out again look again for the key on files and validate its signature 

LVM is just an abstraction layer between partitions and filesystems. You assign parititons/disks to Physical volumes, which you group into volume groups which you split into logical volumes. I wouldn't group your 2 volumes into the same PV/VG but create a PC/VG pair for each volume (one for the raid arrazy, one for the other disk). But after that, you are free to split each VG into several LVs depending on your needs. For example, one for /home, one for /var, one for /tmp... do what you want. PS : If you're a visual person, type "LVM" in google images, you'll get plenty of schematics for better understandings. 

Short answer : You can't, that's how the internet works. Long answer : Two factors make what you want impossible, and that's by design. 1) PHP files aren't provided to client, they are evaluated server-side to produce HTML documents that are then sent to the client. That allow the developper to keep the source code of his website to himself, which increases security. (Even though Wordpress, here, is open-source) 2) Most of the website content is stored in a database, which is no more available to you than the php files(if it is, that's a severe security flaw), as it is also the server who queries it to produce the HTML result. All you can do is get a static version of the website. WinHTTPTracker for Windows, for example, allows you to do that. There must be equivalent tools for linux. 

It heavily depends on WHAT you are going to run. Most recent games are a lot GPU-bound, but some still heavily depend on the CPU(Arma series are good examples of CPU-bound games). Some others don't really need a lot of APU computing and depends on how much computing power your GPU has. Basically here if you have a Dual-core 2.0GHz+, less than 5 years old CPU, it should be OK while you save for a later upgrade. [Personnal estimation here] 

Nope. It supports DDR3 but of speeds 800MHz to 1066MHZ. Those sticks might work, but as those reduced speeds. Also make sure you don't already have the 2 slots occupied. if so, you will have to replace the actual sticks. 

This option resides in the Power managment options. Here is how to find it : Go to Control Panel, locate the "Power Settings" and double-click. There you should find an "Advanced" tab where you will see a checkbox "Ask for a password after waking up from sleep" or similar. Check it, save, and you should be set. 

Another solution is to make a Bind mount, which will "link" the two directories together. Extract from man page : 

My problem is the server doesn't always have time to answer "220 ..." before the socket is closed. So I'm looking of a relatively short, bash-based script that would be a bit more reliable. I couldn't find an easy way to make the command wait a few seconds before closing the TCP connection. I tried but i can't get it to work, and that requires an external file, which doesn't really fit in my auditing suite, and I can't be sure to have it available on all servers. Any simple ideas ? EDIT : versions (yep, old, I know): 

This is totally normal, as it is the way your script stops apache. Check your or script (the name depends on OS), you should see somehting like : 

As part of our DRP researches, we would like to make sure we're still able to access fairly quick to servers when the LDAP is down. I have added timeouts in and made sure PAM checked local accounts/passwords before ldap's. Problem is with the . I have added a timeout to the so it doesn't hang forever. What I don't understand is how works. It seems to : 

I would like to tell my shs client(linux) to ignore the host key verification for a given range of IP addresses, is that possible ? Context : we have this DHCP range we use to build servers before moving them to their production IPs, so I get those SSH warnings regularly and have to delete the offending keys every time... 

Use case : my mother wants to be able to allow the opening of a windows (7) session on my little brother's computer on a "on-demand" basis, without being on premises. Basically, unlocking the session via her smartphone of by giving him a one-time code generated by a device would do. I have seen many articles suggesting Rohos key Generator, but that requires the smartphone/USB key to be physically present and does not require her remote approval. I have also seen many Token products (like RSA SecurID) but most of them rely on a corporate-grade AD architecture and seems way overkill (and overpriced) for such a simple need. Any inputs ? 

That will work without problems. (If you're sure both sticks have the same frequency capabilities) You just won't be able to use the "dual channel" which is just a performance enhancement. See Wikipedia page about dual channel for more details. 

Is there a way to make sshd look up for keys in the files before using the command ? See sshd debug log : (I have made the SSHAuthorizedKeysCommand script to output the date on STDERR when ran.) 

(TDP depends of most of those criteras) By variying all those, constructors build a very wide range of processors in each generation. But as stated in other comments, that is not always the most impacting factor in a computer "speed feeling" which heavily depends on the OS and software used. Note that some of those models are the exact same chips on which the clock speed depends on how well they succeeded in the QA tests. Melting 22nm tracks can be sometimes a bit less well-made on the same production chain, giving a slower processor for the same heat generated. An i5 is often way enough, and a SSD will impact greatly the feeling of a smooth computer. 

Just to write as an answer what came up in comments : Firefox stores its preferences (a.k.a. about:config screen parameters) in a file named prefs.js stored in each user home directory, in where represents the current user directory and is a random generated string of about 12 characters. This file is stored as a 'Delta' which means only parameters that differ from default configuration will be there. i.e. if default config is : 

As sugegsted in my comment, the asker found out that the OGG audio player used by Wikipedia is made in Java, and thus requires the Java plugin to be installed on your browser. You can find the player on the very bottom of the page, providing an audio version of the wiki page. Source : $URL$ 

The linux user smbguest has "smbusers" as his main group here is the local file : drwxrwxr-x 2 root smbusers 4096 Aug 1 11:00 /smb/ When i mount it as cifs or access to it from a windows host, i am able to create,rename and delete directories I am able to create & edit files, but not rename or delete files in share root, even if i just created them and am their owner. Just like if i had no "write" access to the folder... but i do, since if i and do it from there i can. This seems somehow related to CIFS ACLs, would someone be able to explain ? 

My bet is that there is a default value for that hold most of what's set in my environnement and that defining it without erases it. Or that's a sudo bug I should submit ? 

Under any linux system, you want to use the command . (Disk Usage) Common usage is : or Replace 'h' by 'k','m' or 'g' for Kilobytes, Megabytes and Gigabytes instead of human-readable. With k/m/j switches, you can even pipe the output un (numeric sort instead of lexicographic) to get the sorted by size list of files in a directory. If you still have a big difference, you may want to try the switch to which will allow you to diagnose sparse files. (files with empty space inside, to be simple) For more information, see the manual page of 

To do what you want, you have to either copy a 'default' configuration file to the user's when he logs (via its file for example) or simply replace the file with a symbolic link to a default one. (which would be read-only for users and read-write for admin, still an example) Hope that helps. 

(Note, that's Ubuntu 13.10 with a backported 3.12 kernel) With this sudoers, when I do I get almost all my unprivilegied user's environnement, including and . Now if I append this line to the file, the environnement gets stripped as hell : 

Like most command, you will get the year information only if the date is older than 365 days. Meaning we're the 2014 May 22th, so 2013 May 23th will display just as "May 23th (hour)" but 2013 May 21 will display 2013 in stead of the hour. 

gI was installing myself samba on a minimalist fork of ubuntu (linux-lite). At first I installed it without any user managment, and only a guest account, here is my smb.conf 

loop over all folders recursively (look for a tree-traversal algorithm, rather simple) For each folder, list all files with use to make a list of words used. Insert in a list For each next file, split its name the same way, and remove any word from not in . (with perl's grep for example, or use a loop) Once you have the list of common words, re-loop over files, and for each For each file, for each word, rename the file to remove the word (using bash's with perl's ) done. 

So not only do you have count in MiB/GiB on the first side, but you may have a "sparse file" in front of you. (I'm assuming here that you are using coreutil's and not POSIX's) 

Alt Left is associated to the search bar, so you trigger it when doing Alt L.+F1 That's the shortcut you want to change/remove through Ubuntu's system settings/keyboard/Shortcut window. 

Tonight i was trying to look at my proxie's lines, and I came up with this, which seems all but KISS. How would you do it simply ? 

Yes, but they won't beneficiate from "Dual Channel" technology which doubles the memory bandwidth if two identical sticks are used. Just make sure the new RAM stick is compatible with your motherboard in terms of frequency. 

I am trying to catalog which smtp servers are used in an heterogenous pool of servers, and so far I was doing : 

What this error message says is "I am unable to connect throught a local file" which can mean either mysqld is not running or it is configured to disable socket or it is in another place. To completly reinstall mysql : 1) Purge totally mysql packages : (depends on distributions). You can check for remaning packages with 2) Check that the configuration file is gone. It should be under or . You can make sure by doing . (Note : anything under /usr/share are documentations and example configuration and should not make problems) 3) Remove or move the directory which containe (old) database files 4) should get you a fresh new mysql install. 5) If the error remains, check that mysqld is running using command . If it is, you may want to specify the "sock" parameter under "[mysqld]" in the configuration file names in 2). You can also try to connect using to force a network connection instead of using UNIX sockets.
