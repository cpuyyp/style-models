If you absolutely must run Puppy Linux, there's a version for the Raspberry Pi 2 & 3: Quirky Linux 8.1 for Raspberry Pi2 and Pi3. But I can't recommend running it at all: it defaults to running everything as root, which is about the worst idea ever. 

Windows doesn't know to look past the first partition on an SD card, so won't find the one you made. 

Yes, it will work, because it's not read-only. Yes, it will damage your system. You'll need to look at mounting root read-only, and having a small ram/tempfs file system for the things that Linux needs to keep track of. No, because there's a good chance you will have damaged the filesystem. 

Absolute safest would be Bluetooth serial. With a supported USB dongle on the Raspberry Pi and something like a Bluefruit EZ-Link on the Arduino, you could program and control the Arduino from the Raspberry Pi with no physical connection. Next best would likely be through USB. There is a “standard” protocol (Firmata) for interacting with Arduino and sensors, but it might not be ideal for robotics. 

If anyone needs more information on how to get this done. Leave a comment and I'll try to get back to you. 

About that warning with the files list file for package 'fail2ban', I removed that file in attempt to fix this problem. I tried to use but it says that it's already on it's newest version. Even though it's not working. Here are some other things I've tried. 

Download the package here. Move the .deb package onto a usb drive. Plug that drive into one of the PI's usb slots. To mount the drive, use this command . sda number will vary. Move the .deb file into your home folder. To install the package use the command followed by the command . Restart the Pi. Hopefully, your internet connection will be working once again. If it doesn't work, there may be another problem. 

Open up the Raspberry Pi configuration menu by entering . There should now be a menu that's popped up. This is the Raspberry Pi configuration screen. Select option 8 and press enter. Select option A6 and press enter once again. From there you should be able to change wether the audio is forced through or the . 

to , reboot, and see if it works. You may need a bigger power supply for your Raspberry Pi, or use an external supply for the drive. 

The Zigbee module will need a UART connection, but the RF module likely will not. Although simple RF modules do use a serial protocol, it's usually done in software and wrapped in Manchester encoding to make the transmission more robust. 

You will need level conversion (something like 4× 74AHCT125), and use the 5 V power instead of 3.3 V. Also, there's a good chance that the 16 optoisolators are drawing more current than a Raspberry Pi can supply, and that might be causing your USB controller (and hence Ethernet too) to shut down. Backfeeding 5 V into the 3.3 V GPIOs could well damage your Raspberry Pi, especially when the 5 V is coming from a board with lots of inductive loads such as relays. 

If this didn't work, try taking a look at this to see different solutions and for more information on this subject. Good luck. 

I have no idea what I should do from here. Any help with this would be awesome. I'm running Raspbian Wheezy 7 on the RPi 2. 

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here, but I really need this driver to be installed. This may be some useful information: 

For some reason, my WIFI dongle doesn't want to connect to the internet anymore. It was not too long ago. But I think something happened that caused it not to work. I can't figure out what's going wrong but I think it has something to do with me uninstalling the package. I have a strong feeling that removing that package somehow messed up my WIFI connection. It was working perfectly before that. If anybody knows what to do about this, that'd be great. I even tried to connect to my pi through an ethernet connection but I still have no luck with it. I can't even scan it on my network. I know for a fact that the WIFI was configured correctly because everything seemed to work fine until not too long ago. I have absolutely no clue what I did. Let me know if you need anymore information than this. Thanks for any help. It's appreciated. 

Both programs have slightly confusing options, so I leave the choice of bitmap size to you. seems to create a proportional font from Inconsolata; you will have to use options to fix this. The files in have a very specific naming convention (not least, they have been compressed with gzip). I don't know if it's acceptable to just dump properly-named font files in there and console-setup will find them, or if there's a control file you need to edit to say what's available. Inconsolata lacks box-drawing characters, which are typically assumed to be in console fonts, so if you run curses-based programmes, the results may be unusual. 

Sometimes, even if you've changed the host name via , the settings don't stick. To make it permanent: 

You may break Debian's packaging system if you install modules from CPAN. There's some discussion about it on PerlMonks: What is the best way to install CPAN modules on Debian?. Alternatively (and untested by me) there's debian.pkgs.cpan.org. 

Well, I've fixed it by restoring from another backup I had. I don't even know if I should keep this question up. But just in case there are people out there who are as clueless as I am. DO NOT DELETE THE PACKAGE EVER Never thought I'd be saying that. Nobody in their right mind would delete their network management software, right? I learned the hard way. Took a lot of work getting the computer back to normal. Fortunately, there is a much better solution for other people that may run into this problem. Here's how you can install the package without a connection. 

I've tried making a build directory in the /lib/modules/4.1.19-v7+/ directory, but all it does is search for a non-existant Makefile. Here's what the Makefile looks like for anyone who would like to check it out. 

I've recently updated to by building it from source (Since I can't download it from the repositories, I'm still using Wheezy 7.0). The build went perfectly and once it was installed, using the command gave this output. 

Is ssh running? The default has recently changed to have it turned off. ssh can be enabled on first boot by creating a file called “ssh” in . As can be written to by any OS that understands SD cards, this extra step is easily done on first installation. It does not need to be done again with the same card image. 

If it's the LXDE "Temperature Monitor", it seems to be just reading , which returns an integer value in millicelsius. If it's not hard-coded, try setting the language/locale to where you are in . Otherwise … welcome to how most of the world indicates temperature ☺ 

assuming that myhostname is the name you want to use. Save, exit and reboot, and the message will go away. 

1 & 2 may be difficult on a Pi 3 due to the change in GPIO serial port specs. 3 & 4 may hit problems with availability of a Bluetooth serial profile for the Pi.
