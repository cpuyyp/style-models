If all your interfaces are passive in OSPF, OSPF will never create neighbors. Also, you really don't want the same network on two device separated by a layer-3 link since devices on Access VLANs 10 and 20 will never be able to communicate with Comms VlANs 10 and 20, and neither will be able to communicate with Core VLANs 10 and 20. You really need to rethink this design. 

This question is probably not worded well. Why install a leased line if you don't want communications between sites? You can put routers and/or firewalls on each end of a leased line, and you can put in rules/ACLs to limit the communications to/from certain hosts/servers/networks, etc. Edit: Any good firewall can block traffic between the businesses using the same leased line. Basically, you can separate the businesses by VLAN, and forbid traffic between the VLANs. Firewalls normally default to block everything, and then only allow what you specifically configure them to allow. 

Having both HSRP and VRRP on a router is fine, as long as they are configured on different interfaces, which seems to be the case. There are probably several things wrong with the way this is configured. For example, in not used consistently (see , ), and I would actually put a delay on it so that minor bounces don't have it jumping back and forth unnecessarily. HSRP and VRRP are protocols for redundancy for the LAN hosts. It may be that whoever set this up thinks it is redundancy for the routers (many people do, but they are wrong). The routers must be able to communicate with each other over the LAN defined by the interface configuration, else each will think it is master for that LAN. Both protocols work by fooling the hosts on the LAN. Unless the satellite link is a LAN host that can be fooled by VRRP, then it really is incorrect. If NAT is not being used, then there is no need for any NAT statements, and that may be the result of a poor cleanup job. You should really just rethink this from scratch, put your proposed solution in the lab (never replace a working configuration with out testing), then fix the routers to make sense to you. 

According to the Cisco 300 Series Managed Switches Data Sheet, the SG300 switches can do IPv4 routing: 

R1 and R2 are the routers for the two departments, and R3 is the router in common. S1 is a layer-2 switch which connects all three routers. You will need to have some way to let each router know about the routes behind the other routers, either statically configured (doesn't scale) or with a common routing protocol. This is basic networking, it is perfectly acceptable, and it is not at all uncommon. 

Cisco has guides on how to harden your network devices. For example, the Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices 

A source host will compare its layer-3 network to the layer-3 network of the destination address. If the layer-3 destination address is on the same network as the source host's layer-3 address, the layer-2 destination address used is that of the destination host. If the layer-3 destination address is on a different network than the source host's layer-3 address, the source host will use the layer-2 address of its configured gateway (router). The source host will use something like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to resolve the layer-3 destination address, or layer-3 gateway address, to the layer-2 destination address, and it will build a layer-2 frame to encapsulate the layer-3 packet with the layer-2 destination address. A router receiving a layer-2 frame will strip off the layer-2 frame from the layer-3 packet. The router will look up the destination layer-3 address in its routing table. If the router cannot find a match to the destination network, it will discard the layer-3 packet, other wise the routing table will tell the router where to forward the layer-3 packet. The router will build a new layer-2 frame for the interface it will use to forward the packet. 

You probably want to use the word "interface" instead of "port" because a port could be a transport layer address, e.g. TCP port 80 is used by HTTP. Devices don't really have addresses, the addresses are assigned to the interfaces, either physical or logical interfaces. Routers route between networks, so each router interface needs to be in a different network. For Cisco's IOS, you often create logical interfaces (loopbacks, SVIs, etc.), and you assign addresses to those interfaces. Switches can have addresses assigned to SVIs. When you use a GUI to assign addresses to a device, you are really assigning an address to a particular interface of the device. I assume you mean something like a home router (off-topic here). A home router will usually have two router interfaces (WAN and LAN), and each of those interfaces get assigned to a different network, and the router routes traffic between the networks. The LAN interface of a home router may be a logical interface to which a switch module and WAP connect inside the chassis. 

BFD operates on top of layer-3 and layer-2, so it is not concerned with IP or MAC addressing. In fact, a layer-2 protocol, e.g. PPP, between the routers may not use MAC addresses. When a router sends BFD, including BFD Echo, to another router, it will use the layer-2 and layer-3 addresses of the other router as the destination layer-2 and layer-3 destination addresses of the frame and packet, respectively, but that really has nothing to do with BFD itself, which, in theory, is independent of the layer-2 and layer-3 protocols used to carry it. When Router A sends BFD to Router B, it will use Router B's layer-2 address (possibly a MAC address) as the destination layer-2 address, and it will use Router B's IP address as the destination IP address. When Router B sends BFD to Router A, it will use Router A's layer-2 address (possibly a MAC address) as the destination layer-2 address, and it will use Router A's IP address as the destination IP address. It doesn't matter if the BFD sent is a Control or Echo packet. The underlying layer-2 and layer-3 protocols need to use the layer-2 and layer-3 destination addresses of the target router. For instance, when a host with a web browser sends a request to a web server, the web server replies with the destination address of the requesting host, not its own address. BFD is the same way; it is the payload of the layer-3 protocol, which is the payload of the layer-2 protocol. 

RFC 2328, OSPF Version 2 defines the Type 1 and Type 2 external metrics. Type 1 metrics are used if the primary cost is internal to your AS, but Type 2 metrics are used if the primary cost is external to your AS. 

Switches do not have forwarding tables, nor do switches have any concept of subnets. Switches also do not have ARP tables. You seem to be confusing routers with switches. Switches operate at layer-2, and routers at layer-3. A subnet is a layer-3 construct, and ARP resolves a layer-3 address into a layer-2 address. Switches do not remove the layer-2 frame, the way routers do, to even see the layer-3 packet addresses. A switch builds and updates its MAC address table each time a frame enters an interface. A MAC address table is per switch. It makes no sense for one switch to update another switch's MAC address table. A switch uses the MAC address table to figure out to which switch interface to send a frame. If the frame's MAC address is not in the switch MAC address table, the frame will be flooded to all the switch interfaces other than the one where it entered the switch. 

If you have a single layer-3 switch to which the LAN connects, you don't need an FHRP for the LAN. The question then becomes how to load balance from the layer-3 switch to the Internet. If you need the layer-3 switch to know about the specific routes advertised from each ISP in order to make intelligent decisions about which direction to route particular packets, then BGP would certainly be the right choice. Any FHRP will need to have a layer-2 connection between the routers. That would make the uplinks from the layer-3 switch be layer-2 links, but that doesn't seem to be how the layer-3 switch should be used. I really don't see the need for two separate routers on each ISP link. That could be handled by a single router. Another way to go is to have the links from the layer-3 switches toward the Internet be routed links, and just use the default route on each one. The default routes could be equal cost, and, depending on your layer-3 switch, could naturally load balance. You should think carefully about load balancing. You can end up with asymmetric traffic flows which may cause problems. You can also slow down because of the out of order packet delivery problem. There is no guarantee that to and from a particular place on the Internet is equidistant from your site on each of the ISPs, or even that to a place and from a place will use the same ISP (asymmetric). 

The answer to your question."Is it possible to ping (in other words to exchange data) a computer which is connected to internet with dynamic IP?" is yes, but with caveats: 

Much of what you ask depends on the way a device is configured, and there is not a single answer to your question. For IPv4, a router will, by default, only change the TTL and Header Checksum fields, unless a packet needs to be fragmented. Fragmentation will change other fields, e.g. Fragment Offset. IPv6 does away with the Header Checksum and fragmentation, so a router will change the Hop Limit field. Firewalls do not need to NAT, nor does NAT need to happen on a firewall. There are different types of firewalls. If you route on your firewall, then the router part of the firewall will change the same fields as a router. Many firewalls are transparent firewalls. You could have a firewall that proxies TCP, but that is not universal. In such a case, the firewall ends up as the TCP endpoint for both ends of the desired TCP connection. What gets changed in such a situation depends on the vendor and configuration. Something like this could happen on a server load balancer, too. NAT changes the source or destination IP addresses and/or port numbers, depending on how you have NAT configured. There are various ways of using NAT, and what gets changed depends on the NAT method. Changing anything in the packet header requires the Header Checksum field to be recalculated.
