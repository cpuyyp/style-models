if the next run starts before the previous one finishes (e.g. is the script re-entrant?) or if a run fails to complete correctly or if the next run fails to start at all or on time (e.g. what happens if the machine is off when the next run is due to start) and about the logging and reporting of failed or successful runs. 

Unless the sending mail-server (e.g. the one operated by an ISP or webmail service) checks it then an email can be sent with the address set to any valid address. A recipient has to check the routing () information in the email header to see whether this source is likely. Some emails also have and entries that may add to or detract from the credibility of the claimed origin. 

It depends on the defragmentation program. At a minimum it will aim to put the clusters for a single file or directory into a contiguous sequence, providing that there is space available to do this. It may also sequence files and directories according to usage profiles, if it collects these. It may not be able to move some files (certain open and system files typically). The reason for defragmenting is that random reads are considerably slower than reading a continuous sequence of blocks/clusters off the disk. However, not all file systems or operating systems have the same requirements for (separate) defragmentation programs. 

I've not tried it but there is a batch method using OpenOffice.org that you could test. Instructions on doing this on GNU/Linux and Windows platforms described at $URL$ (and also at $URL$ and, at $URL$ The principle of using OpenOffice.org to read in the .doc file and then export it as a PDF seems sound if you find OpenOffice.org makes areasonable job of opening the .doc files you have. 

A simple approach, though not quite what you are looking for... Use a hex editor to create a file with the bytes in that you want to send (you mention gnome so you may already have ghex but any hex editor should be fine). For short hex sequences I usually include the hex as part of the name (e.g. test0x0100af0fe1). Then just redirect the content into , e.g.: 

Work out where you first get 100% packet loss of ICMP pings. Try one or two pings to 127.0.0.1, your local external IP interface, your router (if any) or default gateway, ISP hosts (e.g. DNS server, mail server). Try (stop after 3 pings or 12 seconds) and let it finish by itself rather than ending prematurely as some ping, network stacks or networks can cause long delays on ping transmissions: patience can be helpful. [In particular, for Ubuntu, if you see long delays on sending pings (typically a 5s timeout when pinging by hostname), look at $URL$ on how the avahi daemon can introduce these delays.] Possible causes of ping loss: 

This has the disadvantage of having to prepare a separate file but it makes replication and documentation of tests easier. 

testing web pages for logical structure for search engines testing web pages for accessibility to screenreaders (e.g. for visually impaired users) fast, safe access to text-based web sites. 

USB peripheral switches are available from several suppliers (e.g. Maplin in the UK: $URL$ and manufacturers (e.g. ATEN). Some KVM switches also have USB peripheral switching capability (e.g. some ATEN models) -- this is in addition to supporting USB for the keyboard and mouse switching between PCs. You can also have a couple of small USB hubs (or just single USB extension connections) on the desktop and move the printer connector between these manually. I use this for connecting USB flash drives, for example. However, as with USB peripheral switches, it is your responsibility to make sure that moving from one computer to the other is done in a timely fashion that suits the host, the application and the peripheral, e.g. for a USB flash drive you should unmount the drive before unplugging or switching and you may need to follow a similar process for, for example, a USB-connected printer. Whether these would work well with your specific USB device and requirement is not certain but you may be able to get specific advice from the peripheral supplier or switch supplier or current users of the combination. I don't know of any of these that would automatically allow a peripheral to be shared between multiple hosts: for printing, a print server is a better solution unless you want to manually switch between computers each time the printer is needed elsewhere and the manual switching works reliably. 

has a simpler interface for this type of purpose if is installed, the machine is running and the user is allowed to use the command. For example (check the exact syntax using or ), file or file will run the commands in the specified file in 53 minutes or 2 hours, respectively. can then be re-run at the start of the scheduled job with suitable (random or otherwise) start, count, and time-units. Edit As Arjan points out helpfully below, if you are using this for other than a toy application you need to think about issues such as what happens 

In the past year, all of my computers have started having a behavior where heavy disk/cpu usage will block or cause input lag. The mouse will hitch, keyboard input will be super slow as if it's throttled. I have never seen this behavior before outside of very old PC issues where hard drives were running in PIO mode. It happens on all four of the machines I have access to. Two of them have SSDs as primary hard disks. One of them, a laptop, is running a completely new and fresh install. None of them have any viruses. This seems to be a new thing, as none of these machines behaved this way until fairly recently (the oldest machine is 5 years old, the newest is only 2.5 years old). There's no commonality in any of the hardware. (Macbook pro, core i7 920 system, core i5-2500 system, and a dell laptop with an older i5). My best guess at this point is some kind of change in windows itself with regards to input event handling, but that seems crazy to me. 

I am running Ubuntu 13.04 on a Macbook Pro (8.2). I have a faulty bluetooth antenna that I am not interested in paying to fix. In windows I have a usb bluetooth dongle and I just keep the built in bluetooth disabled. However, I am new to Ubuntu/Linux and I can't quite figure out how to disable the internal bluetooth adapter in Ubuntu, and setup the USB adapter in its place. The USB Adapter is an Asus BT-400, which apparently runs the BCM20702A0 Broadcom chipset. Which my limited googling suggests is compatible with linux. That being said, the primary goal here is to completely disable the internal bluetooth so that it's never active. Getting the dongle working is a bonus, and I can simply buy a different linux compatible one if necessary. 

I am having a problem getting a specific device to work, and I am trying to start from square one by making sure there are absolutely no leftover files from driver installs on my system. Specifically I'm trying to get rid of the UC-Logic drivers for a Monoprice 10x6 tablet. However, I have found copies of the driver files in the windows DriverStore\FileRepository. But windows will not let me delete any folders from that location. The best info I have found so far is to use pnputil.exe, however, since the drivers are not currently installed, it is not listed as an inf file that I can remove. I could, as a scorched earth policy, jump into OS X and just delete them from there, but I'm worried that this may cause me issues. I would much rather find the 'proper' way of doing it. 

The United States (Apple) keyboard is the culprit. Setting the keyboard to standard US keyboard as default fixes the issue, with no apparent downside. 

Not sure what's up with this. But my default bind for ctrl-` in Sublime Text 2 doesn't work. I can rebind it to something else, that works, but the app doesn't recognize any bind involving the ` key. I'm on a late 2011 15" MacBook Pro and running Windows 7 via Bootcamp. One of the problems appears to be, after logging input, that when I hold the control button, Sublime Text believes that the input that was pressed was \. If I hold the Fn key, I can actually convince it that yes, it is a backquote. But once I started looking at this, I found all kinds of other weird little issues. Language is set to United States English, and the keyboard is set to United States (Apple). Any ideas? 

I purchased an upgraded wireless card (Intel Centrino 6300) for my Dell Studio XPS 16, and need to know the correct antenna configuration. There were no install instructions for the wireless card, nor does the laptop itself explain the antenna configurations. The laptop has three antenna cables, black, white, and grey. One of them was not used on the old wireless module. The wireless seems to work with the assignment I've chosen, but I've been having some connectivity issues which are perhaps related to an improper configuration. 

Didn't see this exact question on here, so figured I'd ask anyway. It's simple, I do a lot of dev on a macbook pro, and now I'm using a bootcamp a lot as well. My muscle memory has me doing command-x/c/v for control and paste options. So I'd like to find a way to swap those keys in Windows 7. It's not part of a VM, just booting directly in to Windows. In bootcamp, the command key acts as a windows key, if that's any ehlp. 

I have a laptop with a harddrive that spins down so aggressively (after ~10s of inactivity) that it causes performance problems in games and various other apps that have frequent but spread out drive accesses. The spin-up causes a two second pause in whatever app is initiating the disk access. I've found a half-solution which is to use hdparm for windows to change the drive's spin down timeout. But the problem is if the system reboots or sleeps, that value gets lost, and I have to run hdparm again. What would be a good solution to make this kind of fix permanent? I run hdparm via batch files right now, but that requires a security prompt click, so it can't really be properly automated. Is there a way to make the equivalent changes to the drive settings with some method other than hdparm? Specifics: Windows 8.1 MSI GS60 Ghost Pro 2PE-053 Hard drive in question is an HGST HTS721010A9E630 (Hitachi Travelstar 7k1000) 

This behaviour is seen when the first gateway (in this case the wireless network side of the router is set to not issue/retransmit/forward ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED messages. ( depends on these for the increasing IP protocol time to live (TTL) fields set in its outgoing requests to know the IP address and round-trip-time for each gateway on the path to the host). This is done for a mix of performance and security reasons. It may be possible to adjust the handling of these (and other) ICMP packets in the router set-up. The times and IP addresses for the first and last entries are known from the IP address of the host and the IP address of the furst gateway. 

All these approaches really only work where the digital media, software and hardware are DRM-free. Option 4 combined with option 2 and all DRM-free media probably gives the most versatility. Option 2 would be my second choice, but that probably requires DRM-free and a licence that allows backup copies (e.g. in the long term there is little point having backup copies of the downloaded media if they can only be played on one particular hardware player). Currently I keep audio recordings on a PC, with a backup on an external HDD. I keep a subset of these on a couple of USB audio player and some more in a mirrored directory between all the PCs I use. Video material is either on a PVR or on DVDs. I do use Magnatune, but just for downloads, no subscription. 

One method is (assuming you have a working LaTeX installation) to compile the LaTeX diagram to produce a pdf output file (usually using ). This can then be opened using the vector graphics editor Inkscape. Inkscape can import a range of files, including pdf (using the poppler libraries) and can save them as SVG files. (Inkscape also provides command-line conversion capabilities but I don't know whether this is available on a Microsoft Windows system). 

Check that you have the latest BIOS for the laptop, this is an area where manufacturers make improvements over time as there is more user experience with the machine. Worth checking anyway for any other improvements that you might benefit from. Doesn't this machine have a 'whisper mode' when the fan switches to a low speed and the processor runs slower to reduce heat build up? If this profile suits the laptop and your requirements it may provide some mitigation if the problem is just that the replacement fan is a bit noisier than the original (fans the same size can have quite different performance characteristics in throughput, noise and speed as well as different construction and bearings so a like-for-like replacement is quite difficult, leaving aside that even two fans of the same model from the same maker may not behave in just the same way).

Remember that is just a snapshot of memory usage. The result you are seeing may imply that, at some point in the past, the system was getting short of RAM so swapped-out RAM-resident material. Since then, RAM has become free but the material on swap has not been required so is still held on swap rather than just cluttering up RAM. If that is the case, turning off swap would be a bad idea. Are there any processes that could demand such a large amount of RAM since the last reload? Additionally, you may want to check that you don't have a restriction on maximum resident size set via ulimit (usually in /etc/profile but maybe it varies with distributions and it can be set per-process (e.g. in a launch script)). Finally, on Microsoft Windows there are reports of specific issues with Firefox being swapped out to disk, e.g. when minimised (e.g. $URL$ I've not heard of that on GNU/Linux systems but it may be worth exploring. 

If the ISP provides day-by-day or hour-by-hour usage information perhaps you could try a period of time with no machines running and then several periods with one machine only but doing the normal work for that machine to see if you can identify whether the increase is on one of the machines rather than other(s). 

I'm not sure I've entirely understood the question, mainly use Scribus 1.3.3 but occasionally 1.3.5, both on Ubuntu, so the differences in version and platform may outweigh any similarities but, FWIW, ... After creating the table it needs to be ungrouped. Text can then be added to individual cells by selecting the cell (e.g. click on the cell). Individual cells can also be resized by selecting the cell and using the frame handles as usual. A sequence of cells can be selected (select and shift-select each of the cells) and then manipulated together. This can, for example, resize or reposition a whole row or column. Similarly, a column or row of cells, after they are all selected, can be copied and pasted. The new column can have all its cells selected and then slid into position. Spanning can be achieved manually by deleting a cell then expanding a neighbour. However, this sounds just like what you don't want - a bunch of grouped text areas. Anything more complex I import a table constructed elsewhere, not least as I'm no expert in Scribus.
