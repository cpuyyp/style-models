I couldn't understand the question very clearly but is the command that comes to my mind. It is an internal command being a feature of as external commands exist as separate executable files, usually in folder. command executes other batch files (with extension) within the calling script and may pass arguments to that external executable file assigned as to its parameters. Moreover, call command may for (defined as inside the batch file, and otherwisely intended and working with command as points or sections in a batch file to switch the execution to, which is an old and might also be a wrong feature) within the script itself without referring to any external batch file. The command is well documented in an SS64 page, and it's main difference from just calling the other script or executable file without any using any command, say as or is that it doesn't leave and exit the current script when calling or upon the external script's finishing, keeping it in the current session, and comes back to and continues executing the calling script's following lines, where the call is originated from. 

I want to close the current tab on clicking that is two minuscule w's sequentially So I imagine I need to put in a line similar to the following 

You might consider redirecting the result of the command, that's what it ouputs to the stdout console screen by default, into a file instead using the redirection operator 

It's the most efficient replacement I've ever tried, and am very happy to get rid of Window's default Task Switcher Application use it. Added screenshots to aid with locating: 

then parse the first (date) and/or second (time) field and compare with the current date () and time () with comparison operator: 

An excerpt from the article: Here Document A here document is used to redirect input into an interactive shell script or program. We can run an interactive program within a shell script without user action by supplying the required input for the interactive program, or interactive shell script. The general form for a here document is − command delimiter document delimiter Here the shell interprets the operator as an instruction to read input until it finds a line containing the specified delimiter. All the input lines up to the line containing the delimiter are then fed into the standard input of the command. The delimiter tells the shell that the here document has completed. Without it, the shell continues to read input forever. The delimiter must be a single word that does not contain spaces or tabs. Following is the input to the command to count total number of line − 

ps: here terminates the process tree () by it's image name () forcefully () (without prompting for confirmation) 

indicates the current directory - the folder you're in, and is a directory separator, separates a parent directory name from it's children files or another subdirectories, for instance: - here is the root directory, is it's subdirectory, and is a file (as you see there are no separator in file names, as they can not have children nodes) it's all the same on windows (dos), expect the separator character is backward slash () 

The simplest implementation of that would be to issue: in Windows, and in Unix-derived operating systems such as Linux Where the star, or asterisk (the character's name, what literally means little star in Greek, starlet), is a catch-all character for all preceding characters or the entire string before the dot and four terminal letters otherwise the extension ( that is) With the variants of in Windows, if you want a bare format, that is just list output, instead of time, date, and file type (directory, symlink or so) in colons, and to to do a recursive search meaning search files with the extension in subdirectories, that is other folders inside the folder, and in their children. 

I've tried theme in Preferences of Wikipedia and saw the categories bar appearing on the top of the page. I liked the idea, but I don't want the default theme to be changed. Is there any custom and/or files available to replace the default location of the categories of Wikipedia articles in its default style, that is moving them from bottom to top. 

save it as a .bat file and execute by passing a parameter eg: will set the the sound volume 60% make sure you put the bat file either next to the nircmd or in (or define its folder in ) 

Have you tried to hold Shift and press the right mouse button RMB in a directory? If it's set as the default shell it will pop up instead of the Command Prompt when the option is clicked 

I suggest to use syntax instead on Git Shell with default shell setting, and look up for variable initialization () inside loop. 

it will remove the part and the space between the file name, and number and then write the output to another file ps: i guess it was 's output, huh? 

This would produce following result − This is a simple lookup program for good (and bad) restaurants in Cape Town. The following script runs a session with the text editor and save the input in the file test.txt. 

Well, I think all updates are necessary, as Microsoft and Windows have a conception of "Optional Updates" which is disabled by default, unless you activate them by checking, marking up the square in some windows of Windows Update application. But, here in your list, you have, Security and NET Framework updates, and it can be told that you use 64 edition of Windows. Basically, all of the updates also note their ID, or KB and seven numbers, which stand for Knowledge Base. I suggest to search google for that ID and get information from Microsoft Knowledge Base for specific updates of interest. Or shortly, you can simply put (append) the number ID into the following URL eg KB3122651 PS By the way you inspired me to write the following script 

It will load all the aliases defined inside the file for the current session only, meaning when you out of process (also known as the shell and Command Prompt), they're gone. To have permanent aliases you can type the full command somewhere in a regedit key called either AutoRun or AutoCommand or something similar, what I cannot recall now alongside the macro file's internal syntax :P 

and save it as and are parameters that stand for the first and second arguments, that is the extension and the folder respectively. For instance executing: 

Activating the system's Administrator user Windows has a special user named Administrator who is deactivated by default and who you call when you Run an executable file as Administrator. That user can be activated to login with as follows (in CLI style): 

By default, is called with the switch which carries out the command and then terminates. The switch karries out but remains, and lets you input commands (after executing the commands inside the batch file, ie the script, or directly given parameters after the commands as in ). If you want to deny input to the user but still let the window hang you can append at the end of the batch script. It would just hang (pause) until the user responded, that is until the user presses any key, and after that exit. The second part of the commands, tat is is to avoid the output "Press any key to continue..." More here or 

Save it as a file (my suggestion being as ) and execute It prompts for the number and accepts input when executed opening the related page on Microsoft Knowledge Base PPS It's written for Firefox, but you can replace the word with to open the links with the native Internet Explorer
