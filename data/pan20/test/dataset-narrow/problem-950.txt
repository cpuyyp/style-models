Unless you are running your own DNS server on the same LAN, and you gave that DNS server an address of 10.0.0.2... your problem is definitely due (in part at least) to the fact that you are using 10.0.0.2 as your DNS server address. Why? 10.x.x.x is a private internal IP address and reserved for LAN usage only. It is not an address that would be used by any publicly accessible DNS. As recommended in the comments, if you change your DNS server address to 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS) or 208.67.222.222 (openDNS address) you should have no problem accessing the internet. Your best bet would be to put one (or both) of these addresses in your router on the DNS settings page, rather than setting them manually on any of the computers. 

Modem.... an ADSL connection? Cable Modem? What model modem? Does the modem have a router built into it (some ADSL modems do)? Since your gateway device has apparently changed (and without your knowledge) maybe you should take your network setup completely apart, reduce it all to the defaults, and start again. You know... use that Reset button on the back of the [unknown model] router and set it up all over again. The fact that the router doesn't have a gateway address anymore, but the modem apparently does means that the modem is now acting like a gateway, and it is passing out the IP addresses for each device. Don't forget. As soon as you reset your router, set up wireless security. For all we know, you could have left it unprotected, and a neighbor (or neighbor's kid) could have accessed and changed your router's settings. 

Testing? For Ram, download The ISO of Memtest86. Burn a disc from the ISO, boot to it and let it run for a few hours. If your Ram is bad, you will know from the abundance of red on the otherwise cool blue screen. For your video card, download Furmark and install. Then run a benchmark. I would not recommend stress testing it until AFTER you see if it can handle a simple benchmark. You will be able to observe frame rates and temperatures while you are testing. If there is an issue, it will develop soon enough... most probably during the short benchmark. 

A lot? As in, what percentage? How many games use the onchip Intel HD3000 graphics? What games specifically use the ATI Radeon 7670m? Why is this important? Because if by "a lot" you mean EVERY game you try to play, then your problem is simple. When you replaced the OS that the system came with, by installing a fresh and clean copy of Windows 7 Ultimate, you did not use the video drivers provided by HP. You downloaded the most recent and up to date video drivers from AMD/ATI and installed those instead. You most likely also downloaded the most recent drivers for your Intel HD3000 (although I think the Windows install would have taken care of them). This is a problem, because using the drivers that came straight from AMD/ATI won't allow for the switchable graphics setup in your laptop. Solution? Remove any trace of the AMD/ATI drivers you currently have installed, download the video drivers from HP for your model laptop, and install them. Oh. How was the replacement of Windows 7 home basic important? You didn't mention how the laptop worked fine playing games before you installed Ultimate. 

The laptop is roughly 2 years old, and I determined that from the reviews dating to 8/25/2011. I would download a utility like GPU-Caps Viewer, and more specifically Furmark to get the most accurate picture of what temps your GPU is running at under specific stress tests. However, the temps you list sound a bit high. That said, it is quite possible the heatsink has an accumulation of dust that should be cleaned. Here's an image I used in a previous answer... 

"save" to Gmail? Email them. Open up a different email account, and email them as attachments to your Gmail account. Or... since you have a Gmail account, use your Google Docs account, and just upload the logs to your Google Docs inbox. Or... activate your Google Drive account since you have Google Docs, since you have Gmail, and upload them to the common drive box. If you want all this to happen automatically... install Google Drive on each machine where you use pidgen, and in the pidgen settings, change the directory where the logs get saved to the Google Drive directory on that machine. They won't get tagged with anything custom, but they will be accessible to you from any other machine. EDIT after more extensive searching, it is possible to do, but with a different IM client to register with Jabber. Once the Jabber account has been created Pidgen should work. 

Playstation 3 features As far as the XBox360 is concerned, their Apps don't support a general web browser, and there is no official support for Flash on the XBox. XBox Support Of course, there are people flashing their XBox consoles and porting all kinds of unsupported Apps... but who knows whether that will support what you are looking for. At any rate... there is one key element to your question, and I quote... 

That's pretty much it. Yes, I didn't tell you what the problem was, because I don't believe I can tell you what the problem is. I can guess, but that's just taking pot shots with a shotgun with my eyes closed. All I can do in a case like this is tell you what you can do to be able to identify the problem reliably. 

It can last up to 8 hours on the absolute minimum settings, in the basic default hardware configuration. That means things like... throttling the processor, a minimum amount of Ram, having the screen at it's dimmest settings, setting the hard drive turn off after a short amount of time, etc. You change the hardware to more power intensive components, and you will have less power. Since it takes power to use Ram (unpowered Ram doesn't do anything useful), adding more Ram will consume more power. Once the computer is turned on, there is power to the Ram. You are not only sending power to the amount of Ram you think you are using at that moment. Adding a faster, stronger processor will also consume more power. Now. You want to know... 

Here are Apple's instructions for using Disk Utility to create a RAID set. Of course, knowing more about your hardware (the computer we are talking about, etc) could improve answers and how specific they get. 

With mini-pci wireless cards, this can sometimes happen when an antenna coax cable isn't terminated properly (damaged) or connected to the card properly. Some cards will actually go so far as to disable this antenna when this occurs, but other cards will just heat up as a damaged or improperly connected antenna is essentially creating a short. Double check your re-assembly job. Make sure you did not pinch the antenna leads anywhere (they go from the card, up through a hole to the other side of the motherboard, through one of the hinges and to either side of the screen), make sure that the antenna leads are not touching any motherboard contacts where a short could be occurring (the insulation on the antenna coax is quite thin), and make sure the antenna coax are properly connected to the card. 

If you right click on the image, and you choose "Edit" you will most likely find that MSPaint is still the default editor. If you open the image in Windows Image and Fax Viewer (right click, preview will do it), when you mouseover the Edit button, you see how it says the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+E? It's right there on your example image. The issue is that you have software currently installed on your system that has overridden this default behavior of Ctrl+E. For example... if you are in Windows Explorer, Ctrl+E opens a search assistant. Ctrl+E in Chrome also wants to perform a search. Ctrl+e now fails to edit an active Remote Desktop session now. So, when you press that button in Windows Image and Fax viewer, it attempts to perform that Ctrl+E.. instead of the command that is sent when you right click on an image and choose Edit. And somewhere along the line, CTRL+E has been altered. You are not the only person with this issue out there, and for all the registry fixes that are suggested, nothing seems to work to restore this function for those who have lost it. EDIT it doesn't even matter if you change the default editor in Windows (through a manual registry edit). The Right Click-Edit function will work with the new program (or MSPaint, or whatever you choose), but the Edit button of the picture viewer still won't open ANY editor. 

We don't know the make and/or model of the laptop, and thus we don't know how old it is. We don't know the environmental conditions you use the laptop in. Warm and/or humid conditions make a large difference as opposed to an air conditioned room. 

seem to be in conflict to a degree. The first implies you want to do this. The second implies you want software to do this for you. My solution satisfies the conditions of the first statement, but not the second. EDIT - I removed the reference to Adobe Photoshop, which costs money, and replaced with GIMP (as well as a link to it) which is free. 

Do you have a program like GIMP, which allows you to create layers, and adjust their transparency? Do you have the time to manually assemble this picture yourself, or is this some kind of academic exercise where you want to find the software that will automatically assemble for you? Because the first thing that came to my mind, was importing each picture fragment into a Photoshop image. The first fragment you import you leave solid. Each subsequent image you import, you put on a new layer and make transparent... and move around until it lines up. Unfortunately... 

You connected the Hard Drive, data only, tested, and the system still worked. So, essentially no change from the previous setup that worked... as far as devices drawing from or connected to the PSU. Then... 

Purchase a cheap USB/SATA 2.5" drive enclosure when you get your SSD. You can get one for around $10 US at most online retailers. Put your new drive in the enclosure. Download the ISO of Parted Magic, since it has both GParted and Clonezilla included. Burn a disc from the ISO Connect the drive enclosure to the computer. Boot to this disc. Use Clonezilla to clone the old drive onto the new one. Use GParted to expand the partition on the new drive to encompass the additional space left untouched by the cloning process. Apply any changes. NOTE some people have had issues with resizing Vista and Windows 7 boot partitions with GParted, so feel free to skip this step until you have booted to the new drive. Expand the partition from Drive management within Windows if you want to take the safe route. Shut down, and replace the old drive with the new drive. Boot to new drive, right where you left off with old system intact. 

What will this prove? Well, for one, if you use Ram and a power supply that you know is working (aka, from a working system), then you can safely assume the issue is either the processor or the motherboard. If the system boots and you can enter the UEFI system browser, then you can power down, and swap out the Ram for one of the sticks you purchased. Power up again. If it works, you can swap out the power supply for the one you purchased. Power up again. You see where this is going? You need to start from the bare minimum you can test, and slowly, piece by piece work your way up to the whole build if you want to find the component that is causing the issue. Any number of bad components (including keyboards) can cause a system to not even get to the BIOS/UEFI. And if you already did all this... you need to detail that fact in your question. 

I can see why that manual isn't very helpful... nothing about port forwarding, nothing about turning off Remote Management. Remote Management is what you are running up against right now, since most home routers by default use port 80 to allow remote management access. One solution is to use another port for your home server, like 8080 for example. Then, simply forward port 8080 to that internal IP address, and make sure that when you want to view the web server externally, you append :8080 to the end of the Dynamic DNS account address. IE if you had as an address, use . Of course, depending on what software you are using to host the server, you would have a few configuration files to alter, to switch from using port 80 to using port 8080.
