And then change the root partition in your to You can do this on your Windows machine, just like you did to add the IP. 

The relay was designed to be operated with a +5V signal, according to its specification. The Raspberry Pi GPIO outputs 3.3V signals. So, this relay is not usable as is with the Raspberry Pi. You will need to either create an external transistor circuit that will control a 5V signal, or use a different relay board. 

Perl is a programming language and associated interpreter. happens to be written in . The probably has to do with your file permissions when you setup It's probably a good idea to stick with which is far simpler to setup and use. is probably not the application for your use case. If you are planning on accessing your files via the Internet and a home based web server, I highly recommend securing the connection via TLS... self-signed certs are fine as long as no one else is connecting to the home server, and you know they were generated by you. Superuser: Self-signed certs for home server question If you have no idea what any of this means... I highly recommend that you don't open your network and home file server up to the Internet. 

I have no experience with this device but it is good to see that you can connect it to your network. It has its own WebUI and also what you are interested in is the "Firmware" API. What makes it slighltly easier to use is the the API is epxosed as GET URL's. What that means is you request data like, based on an arbitary IP. and the result is some nice JSON (but not completely structured). 

Windows IoT Core is simple Windows based ARM kernel that allows you to run single Universal Apps with limited background threads. It is not, as stated before a Windows Desktop environment, it is more like a sandbox. (although more and more features are added constantly) 

The Raspberry Pi has a built in hardware watchdog timer. For Raspbian To load the watchdog kernel module right now, issue the following command: 

Alex Chamberlains security concern should be taken seriously if you wanted to protect the Private Key. Possibly thinking about creating some kind of isolation in your code which requires escalation to access to the SRAM. 

Because vendors try and squeeze everything in to the smallest area this usually means that they will generate a lot of area heat. Solution? There is no solution but try and research another WiFi adapter that runs cool. You can try and run your network in open mode and see if that helps cool it down. This is not a long term solution obviously. Disclaimer Because all Wireless chip vendors keep their designs secret.. there is no actual way to prove or disprove my answer with factual references. Each chip vender have their own design and some USB adapter get hotter than others. 

If so, then you'll need to find the datasheet for the board. The transistor can be setup to activate the coil on a low input... i.e. Ground the input terminal. Or it can be setup to activate the coil on a high input... i.e. 5V applied to the input. If you can't find more information online about that particular board, try asking your local shop for more information. Most electronics shop people will talk your ears off if you ask a question or two... I know, because I was one once. 

Have Xwindows running on the local host. Enable X11Forwarding in sshd_config Use the option with ssh 

Once upon a time, I wrote a few programs in Pascal. It used to be the Computer Science AP language as well... Fortunately, Pascal is supported on GNU/Linux distos through the Free Pascal Compiler. You can install it on the Raspberry Pi via: 

So, it seems that is has two locations for with the user Remove the second one, and see what happens. 

If you are connecting to a remote host via and would like the graphical interface to show on your local display, you need to: 

So, on a system where has not been installed, installing will also install . However, is not the same program as , and seemingly does not rely entirely on the cache. So, in order to properly setup the command is required. There is a clue in output when install and pulling in as a dependency. 

But, one guy by the screen name of sarfata created Pi blaster based on servo blaster. He tweaked the code to better offload to the PWM pin using servoblaster DMA methods. It is not idea but its a great software only solution. 

That process will burn the ISO the USB Mass Storage. Once complete you can then reboot your machine and boot from USB 

When you get the you just stop transmitting and when you get you start transmitting again. Obviosly from the Pi's side you will never need to send because the Pi has enough processor power to handle 115kbs of text without backing up its "buffer" reference: Implemenation abstract 

So I just went and searched for Wii Nunchuck pinout and it seems like your PINS are not connected as in your diagram. It is possible that you numbered your pins in another order but you should cross check. Source 

I was wondering if would need extra parameters to make use of the 4 core A7 on the Raspberry Pi 2? I have read that you can specify at a rate of to run parallel jobs within make. Will this decrease compile time for custom libraries or does make already detect the number of cores on the Pi and get on with it as fast as possible? 

It runs as service when the unit boots which restores the last known timestamp. This ensures the system time is not reset to the default beginning of UNIX EPOCH of 1970. The above program combined with the package, should keep a RPi reasonably close to the actual time depending on network access and reboot cycles. However, as pointed out in the comments, adding a RTC module will ensure accurate time keeping. So, it depends on your particular use case. 

Updates per comments The hostname for GNU/Linux systems, such as Raspbian, is set through the utility. You can change the host name for the Raspberry Pi via: 

It's important to remember that the alias needs to be created in the proper user's environment. So, if you run as , you will need to create the alias in a shell. 

The result of the working procedure is a logical link in to the certificate in and the new certificate being added to the trust store. Hopefully, this tested procedure works for you. 

CA certificates are located in as well as and in some cases . In general CA certs should not be manually added to the local trust store. There are reasons why certain CAs are not included. Without further research, it's unclear why this particular CA root cert was not included in Raspbian. It seems to be included in my Debian 'Buster' installation running Brave Browser. All trusted CA certificates are added to a main trust store at . The main trust store is updated through either through: 

The simple answer is no. You need to rely on what format your USB webcam can provide you with. If it only does mjpeg.. then the only way to re-encode it is as you doing. Some HD Ready/HD camera supply h264 encapsulated streams. (not RAW like the Pi cam) Then the only thing you have to do is transmit the buffer using gstreamer or ffmpeg (compiled) without any transcoding commands. This works well with cameras like that. 

Connect 5v and GND to your power supply. Red for +5volt and Black for GND or -5volts 3.3volts does not need to be connected. 

The Raspberry Pi foundation did admit though that they never intended on using PoE and maybe these were a cheap, fully isolated jack. I studies the PCb closer and it seems like the pins 9 and 10 responsible for POE are not even on the PCB but instead connected to the shield. I took my Model B and tested with a multimeter and the pins marked in red are completely unconnected. But either way if you tired to run power using these pins it would not work. Best would be to crimp both sides of the cable and not have them connected to the RJ45 at all, just in case as some switches might be damaged if you do funny things on those "spare" wires. because of the magnetics this will not (old non magnetic ones would) affect the bandwidth slightly due to noise, but its not like the Pi can use full 100mbit any way ... Remember though, on cables longer than 1 metre, voltage will start to drop because of resistance. Also, do not untwist the Data cables, just try and extract the spare ones around the twist. So it would be best to run 12volts 1A (12 Watts) and then use some kind of efficient regulator to go to 5Volt and run a micro USB cable in to the power connector. On the Model B+ this is the best because there are some nice new power stabilisers but on the Model A/B you can just use the GPIO 5V pin (but put a 1A fuse on) 

In order to get recording to work from my USB headset, which may be approximately the same... as long as the default sound card drivers work... I needed to select device 1 as follows: 

If using the new hostname will be accessible at myhostname.local If is disabled, the new hostname will be accessible at myhostname.domain.tld as long as there is an entered in the DNS zone file. 

If the 74139 decoder is a 3.3V version, the left LED will be lit when power is applied to the Pi. Once the systemd service file is executed, the GPIO pin will select the right LED, and the left LED will turn off. 

Procedure to add CA Certificates Manually It's been awhile since I manually updated CA certs on a client machine. The following procedure worked on my Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Stretch: Create a local cert directory: 

There are some shortcuts for path names. However, using the full path should be more error free for a beginner on UNIX like operating systems. I recommend reading through the Free Pascal Documentation, since there be some changes from what you are used to in other compilers. 

You can easily experiment with adding a parallel capacitance. Simply solder a small value capacitor in across the C1 capacitor listed in the schematics. To lower the overall capacitance value, you'll need to replace the surface mount cap on the board since the board doesn't seem to have any pads to attach series capacitors. 

Remember that it needs to be a "switching" power supply and should show the efficiency somewhere but on small power supplies the efficiency almost doesn't matter. These are also regulated, so they protect your Pi from power surges, short circuits and brownouts. Wikipeadia 

What I would suggest is to use an IP Phone instead. It may save you the whole sound problem headache but I hope you will see the benefits. This would mean installing Asterisk on your Raspberry Pi and resigning from using the Pi as a VoiP "IP" Phone. Also, having an IP Phone means you can directly connect the IP Phone to your VoiP provider defeating the purpose you have in mind. You can get fairly cheap IP Phones that run off LAN or WiFi. 

Basically you are trying to break (a loop) from a non looped code. Causing a syntax error. Or break is not allowed in that context. I suggest the following psuedo code changes. 

You can clearly see they use a CRYSTAL OR CERAMIC RESONATOR as a clock input. Connection a crystal directly is permitted for testing only. In production you really need to balance the crystal with matching capacitors so that the freqauicnies do not stray- which chould lead to data corruption or communication problems when the environment changes (temperatue, humidity and pressure) Because testing is short term you will not if hardly see any variation in frequencies from a crystal. So which crystal should you use? Well- Only the data sheet can provide that answer. It all depends what you want to do. Faster does not mean better. 

You can also check if the default password is what is expected or change the default password by modifying the file on the SD card. The instructions for adding a new user included in the link @Ghanima posted in his comment should work as well. Update From your comment, it seems you are trying to install Noobs without a display, perhaps these instructions will work for you. They are a little on the old side, but perhaps they will still work. My advice would be to download the official Raspbian image which is a lot easier to work with on initial install without a keyboard and monitor. 

Simple Debugging of X11 SSH Connection There is no need to start X11 manually on the Mac side. If you use the option when trying to connect via ssh, you'll get useful debugging messages. Towards the end of messages, you'll notice that X11 is started automatically: 

When prompted for what do to with new certificates, choose . And then select the with space. Test that it works: 

Plug your modified miniSD card into your Pi. Plug in your power cable. Wait 60 seconds. Plug in your USB cable into your Raspberry Pi and your PC. Run on your GNU/Linux machine and wait until you see the serial device register as something like Open a serial terminal program such as . Change your serial device in the program to match your OTG registered Pi. Press Enter 2 or 3 times and wait a few seconds. 

If you have followed all those steps then the only possible thing to try is use another SD Card carefully selected from the compatible list. Also make sure to buy original card from a trusted place. Not like ebay china or something. 

You can try and use the bash invocation read and execute and quoted command line (This is supposed to solve character escaping) 

Its not possible I am afraid. The model A is missing the LAN/USB chip marked in the image. The BCM has 1 USB port, which on the Model B is connected to the LAN/USB Chip. This chip gives extra 2 USB ports that are connected via the PCB routes to the extra pins you wish to use. The other one is connected to the built in LAN interface (inside the IC), so in total 4. In Model A, the red box is missing, so the USB trace goes to NC (No connect) but the alternative route is bridged(highlighted in yellow box) which goes directly the the single USB plug. If you look at the second USB trace it just goes to the LAN/USB IC, which is NC. In Model B, the yellow highlight box is not connected and the USB is connected to the HUB. And from there one trace joins back to the original USB trace and another isolated trace connected to the USB(Highlighted rectangle)
