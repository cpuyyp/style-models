All, we are working creating a shared secret library in Sharepoint. basically the idea being, a user fills out a "Shared Secret" infopath form (AKA "What is your highschool mascot") and then that form is sent to a secure library that only the helpdesk can read. Currently it looks like our sharepoint admin doesn't know how to create a secured library. Has anyone done anything similar in sharepoint? Or does anyone know of some good tutorials for creating something like this? 

I am trying to create a template in ESX that I can automate with PowerCLI. Everything works great so far, but because I have some specific settings, I had to create my own sysprep.inf. Now, the computername and the VM guest name are out of synch. I need to automate this for a sandbox enviornment, so I will constantly be deleting and rebuilding boxes. Thus, I need the VMhost name and the computername to be the same. Am I missing something? 

Not sure what your budget is, but globalscape works pretty well. It also allows for upload/download via a web interface OR using a client. 

Splunk!!!! Splunk!!! Splunk!!!! I use it for a mix of Networking devices, Linux, Solaris, Windows. The only issue is to keep under the free level, you need to be very specific what logs you want to keep, but I found as long as I was diligent in cutting down on chatter, and really only logging the info I needed, I had no problem. $URL$ 

Using this as the first block matches all request not matched by any following block. No Idea why doesn't work, using a regex seems hackish. 

This returns no content when is not as expected, but still returns the content when is completely missing. I thought the first block should handle exactly that case!? Is it because it's the first block? 

I want nginx/0.7.6 (on debian, i.e. with config files in ) to serve a site on exactly one subdomain (indicated by the Host header) and nothing on all others. But it staunchly ignores my settings?! In : 

What's the best way to emulate this? (or should I just allow the local users external access, too, but without password auth, hoping they keep their private keys private?) 

Since order seems to be important: renaming to , which, if sorted, places it last, doesn't change anything. But debian's main config just includes , so I guess they could be included in some arbitrary file-system defined order? 

What should I do? I want to keep the system up-to-date, so I want to pin as few packets as possible, but I also don't want to have to compile anything manually. 

I have a home server with some SSH accounts that have weak passwords. Since we only used it locally, that's not that big a problem. Now I want to allow external access from only one account, but still local access from the others. But this doesn't work (because only a subset of options is allowed in matches): 

We have had our Nagios installation up for a year, and we are now required to give some statistics on how much it has worked and what it has done in the environment. As such, I was wondering if anyone knows if Nagios also holds data records on how many alerts and notifications it sends out? I am not necessarily looking for reports on what it alerted on, but just some raw statistics for a powerpoint. TL:DR Can I extract how many notifications and alerts Nagios has produced in it's existence or between certain dates? 

I will preface this, with the truth that I know little about Macs :-) I am trying to workout a way to block application installations (or executions) on Macs. We have a subset of executive users (meaning they "need" root on the box) who have Macs. However, the are installing applications like Skpe, that break our Corporate Policies. Does anyone know of a software to manage this? Preferably Open Source. 

My assumption is that you were looking at something like Cricket or Cacti. Both of those (like MRTG) can look at the SNMP counters and record graphs of usage. Very awesome and powerful stuff. I have added links to a couple VMApps that have Cacti bundled in. NOTE I have not used either of these VMapps but one is recommended by www.petri.co.il, always a good site. 

but for all possible ? I.e. if the user created a folder I want mail addressed to to land there automatically. The spec doesn't seem to support this. 

Does prevent requests from giving results for , but still treats as . The, to my eyes, obvious solution isn't accepted: 

Currently I'm using Exim to deliver mails via into Dovecot mailboxes. I'd like to add spam filtering, but I don't want to reject false-positives in Exim, and I want to train the bayesian filter from the client. So: How do I configure a spamd such that spam lands in a folder, and when the user finds spam in their , or ham in their , they move it to the correct box which trains the spamd. I have found dovecot-antispam but I'm not sure about its quality, it only seems to support dspam (and crm114, which is dead, last release August 2009). 

I use Debian Stable (squeeze) on a virtual host where I can't touch the kernel, it's stuck (and will be for some time as support told me) at 

Trying to pin the status quo and figured out where the error came from: segfaults. doesn't print anything more so I can't tell what's the actual problem. 

This could be a multitude of failed things. Memory, CPU bank, PSU, Hard Driveor FAN. My guess is on the PSU or fan. The options are these: 

Get the Serial number for the server, find the manual online and see what the beeping could indicate. Look to see if there is a LED panel. Usually beepings are with LED alerts. Or any Hard Drives have Lights. 

I have never done it, but I have seen people setup a "gateway" windows box that has the checkpoint client installed, and then have that windows "Gateway" setup to do port forwarding of all their specifically desired ports (22, 21, 3389) to that remote network. Looks like this site has a nice tutorial on it 

If you can use a startup script in a GPO this is easy If not, then if you are not too skillful with scripting, I would do a laymans approach. First use a tool like angryIP to get a listing of all of the windows desktops you want to modify the tool with 

Also, if you need more flexibility, think of putting a bash script in between nagios and you. This can let you send out messages with greater flexibility, for example you don't want recovery emails sent to your automated ticket creator.
