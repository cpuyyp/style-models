Making backups is really a game of probability. Assuming the data is successfully written to any media (as confirmed by the backup program's "verify backup" function), the weak link becomes the shelf life/survivability of the media. Backup tapes can break and be demagnetized. Hard disks can crash. Optical media (like DVDs and Bluray disks) degrade over time. I view the question of "Is it safe to back up to media X?" less of a yes or no question and more one of your goals and retention requirements. If you're looking at a one-time/one-off/adhoc backup that you plan to use in the short term for recovery, then it's less an issue of reliability and more a question of convenience. Assuming that you're looking at a corporate server backup solution (e.g. ongoing backups, some media rotation schedule and some retention period requirement for each backup), it's still less of an issue of reliability (since you'll assumingly have at least a daily backup) and more one of convenience. So assuming your backup process is rigorous (done according to a schedule and verified for errors) and frequent, I see no issue taking advantage of the larger capacity of Blu-ray disks. Under no circumstances though would I rely on any optical media for long term storage. For long term, tape will be most reliable. To really reduce risk of long term backup storage and avoid restore failures I think it's important to have multiple backups stored in different locations. 

You can create a text file containing the computer names you want to scan (1 name per line) and then run the MBSA command line program as follows: 

My internal subnet is 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0. I don't understand the warning message since a 10.x.x.1 network can just as easily conflict with a remote network as a 192.168.1.x network can. How shoud I proceed? 

The question about which is better is completely subjective and I wouldn't even recommend bringing it up. In fact I assume one of the forum moderators will either edit down or close the question in about 4 milliseconds because of this. The "which is better" discussion is HIGHLY specific to your needs, your politics, development and operations skills, preferences, biases and many many more options. It can't be determined by an outsider whether the change makes sense or is a management game -it could be a combination of all or none. This question should be asked to people in your company. Costs are also nearly impossible to compare without significant analysis. Microsoft and Lotus generally sell each corporate deal at a different price, not to mention possible resellers and their discounts, and features you want, number of servers, etc. It's impossible to answer any of this so I recommend directing the questions inward towards your organization. 

I have an HP LaserJet 4 Plus that I'd like to be able to map (TCP/IP) to my users. I have to give a location for the printer so that the client computer knows where to find the driver. This would be no problem if I add the x86 printer drivers to the Print server properties section of my server and pointed the GPO to the printer installed on my (x64) server. The problem arises when I go to HP's site to find the .inf file required to install this additional x86 driver. The site tells me to just use the in-built drivers that come with Windows. I've done that in order to install the printer to my server, but it gives me x64 drivers. I need to install the x86 drivers. When I attempt to do this using the in-built drivers (right-click printer > printer properties > sharing > Additional Drivers...) it always asks me for a location of the driver that I wish to install. Where are the built-in Windows drivers that are used so I can point this dialog box to that or Where can I get the x86 .inf for this printer? 

I have three forward lookup zones in my DNS server. When I try pinging a server that's part of lookup zone A from a computer that's part of that same zone, I get a response. If I try pinging a server that's not in the same zone as the computer I'm pinging from, I get nothing. When I try an nslookup of the servers that are not part of the same lookup zone, the names resolve correctly. If I append the domain onto the name, I can ping it just fine. Is there a way I can fix this? or do I need to keep appending the domain onto the name if the computer I'm trying to ping is not of the same domain as me? 

I'm trying to use the in-built Remote Assistance (RA) software in Windows 7 to support my users. I initiate a RA session with the user and ask to remotely control their desktop. They tick a little check box that says something to the effect of 'allow helper to respond to UAC prompts' and it pops up with a UAC prompt. The user cannot respond to the UAC prompt because they're not a local administrator - I am. Isn't that what that little check box is for??? I've found this on TechNet from back in '07 on Vista. From what I've found, I could disable UAC (terrible idea) or make all my users local administrators on their computers (yet another terrible idea). I'm hoping that MS has fixed this little oversight in Windows 7. Remote Assistance is completely useless to me if I can't respond to UAC prompts with my username and password 

I have a Cisco RV110W small office router (this configuration process is common to many Linksys/Cisco routers) and I am trying to define QuickVPN clients. When add a client of type "QuickVPN" the router gives me the following warning: (You can find a larger version of the screenshot here 

I've got a standalone Windows Server 2003 running SQL Server 2005 and a Windows Server 2003 Active Directory domain controller. Using maintenance plans/SQL Server Agent, I'm trying to write the database dumps from the standalone box to a share on the DC. I know the usual rules about accessing remote shares (e.g. must use a logon account which has proper rights, etc.). In fact, writing the dumps to another non-DC server in the same domain as the DC works fine. I'm trying to set the SQL Server Agent account's logon credentials to "domain\username" (or username@addomainname). If I specify a username in the form of "domain\username, the error I get (regardless of password) is: "The account name is invalid or does not exist, or the password is invalid for the account name specified". If I specify a username in the form of "user@addomainname", the error I get (regardless of password) is: "The specified domain either does not exist or could not be contacted." I've turned on logon failure auditing on the DC and I see no failures in the log, which suggests to me that the machine isn't even trying to authenticate, but rather failing prior to that. I know that users on non-member servers can authenticate to shares on a DC, because doing an interactive logon (e.g. "net use * \dcname\c$ /user:username@addomainname", or using the other form of the username) works fine. The above example is about SQL Server but applies to any Windows service. Why can't the service log on with the domain account, but an interactive logon (drive mapping) using that same account works? 

With Rackspace's (hosting this particular configuration) support, I now understand the situation. The "net use *..." drive mapping example and the service example is an apples to oranges comparison. With the drive mapping case it's just an authentication that's happening. In the service case, I'm actually attempting to run a local process under domain credentials, which by definition isn't possible since the server isn't in the domain. Not in domain = can't execute under domain credentials. The drive mapping works because I'm not attempting to execute a process as the domain account - I'm simply passing the credentials. This restriction applies to any type of process, regardless of it's interactive or service-based. 

While a virtual machine guest theoretically doesn't "know" anything about it's host (it generally doesn't even know it's even a VM), you can get information about the host by simply treating the host as just another machine on the network, from the point of view of the guest. This assumes that the guest can see the host on the network. Once you have network access (and proper credentials) to the host you have a number of options to gather information: 

I have a colocation facility with my main firewall in it. It has a bunch of site-to-site VPN tunnels built from the main firewall to the firewalls that are in the remote facilities. I want to replace that main firewall with a Cisco ASA but I want to reduce downtime. I want to put the ASA in and configure VPN tunnels to the new firewalls in the remote facilities without taking down the VPN tunnels that are already created on the old firewall. I was thinking that I would split a switch into two VLANs and hook the uplink and the outside interfaces of both firewalls to one VLAN and then the inside interfaces of both firewalls to the other VLAN. But then it hit me that I need a public IP address to set up a VPN and both firewalls can't have the same public IP address on their outside interfaces... So what's a guy to do? How can I put a second firewall in the heart of my network and still keep the original up and running? 

I've got a Linux file server set up by the previous IT department with permissions set up to allow Jane to access a certain folder with the username "jane" My new AD domain that I put in has everyone's username set as first initial, last name so her username in the domain is "jdoe" For reasons I don't want to go into here, I can't just add "jdoe" as a user on the file server Can I set her SamAccountName to "jane" and keep her User UPN Logon as "jdoe"? Will that work to let her into the Linux file share? 

My boss sent out an email from my Exchange 2010 org and attached a PDF and a Word doc to it. He came back the next day and told me that some of the 8 or 10 people that received this email could open up the attachments no problem. The other 2 or 3 people, could not. One of these people who could not open the attachment, went so far as to call Comcast (his email service provider) and ask them where his attachments went. Comcast told this person that when they received the email, the attachment was 0 bytes in size. This may sound like more of a rant than a question but I'm genuinely concerned. Is there any possible way that something could have gone wrong on my end that sent out the email to some with the attachment and to some without? 

My boss is pissed that I created dynamic distribution groups and now he can't expand the list of people that're in those groups. I want the dynamic-ness of it because I want it to be easy to manage but I want him to be able to see who's in the list. Is there a way to do this?
