I have a Logitech Touchpad T650 attached to a server running Windows Server 2012 R2. I use this machine as my regular computer, and there is another user who connects to it remotely (and occasionally comes to my desk to use it if I am not there). This has worked without any problems for some time. Recently, I noticed that 2-finger tap (for right-click) did not seem to be working anymore. On further inspection, I found that the right-click context menu would come up for an instant and then disappear, but I still had no idea what was causing the problem. Then, I noticed that anything I pasted in PuTTY (using right-click to paste) was appearing doubled. From there, I realized that the cause of the whole issue was the fact that SetPoint was running twice, once as me and once as a Remote Desktop user. However, ending the other user's SetPoint executable in task manager didn't really solve the problem - now the TouchPad won't right-click at all. I know that I can solve this problem by restarting the computer, or just logging all users out and logging back in myself, but that is a not really a solution - the problem will just happen again. I also cannot just have SetPoint start only for me or only for the other user because there are legitimate use-cases where only one or the other of us will be logged in on the computer and then whichever of us is at the desk will not be able to use any of the Touchpad features that SetPoint controls. If I remember correctly, this was not a problem in the past, though the Logitech software on this computer has not been updated since its original install as far as I know. How can I solve this problem and get my Touchpad back to the way it is supposed to work? 

P. S. It would be really great if anyone here knows someone in the Office or OneDrive product groups at Microsoft and lets them know that this has to be fixed. 

I do not have personal experience with WD Green drives on Linux, exactly because of this issue. (I use WD Reds in my home server.) However, I was able to find significantly more recent sources that indicate that it is still a problem with all WD Green drives, even the new ones: 

As @Bert said, one way to do this is with a Serial Terminal Server or a Console Server. However, if you will only be using one of these devices at a time and you will be in the same physical location, you could use a much simpler physical switch box, like this one: 

Microsoft provides a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version of the ActiveX Data Components. That way, software developers can make 32-bit and 64-bit programs that use them. The reason they are different sizes is because 32-bit and 64-bit memory pointers are different sizes. (Usually, this would mean that the 64-bit versions would be larger, but that is not always the case, because 64-bit processors also have a lot of optimizations to make certain types of code run using simpler binary/assembly code.) Your assumption that these components were installed along with Office is incorrect. ADO is part of the "Microsoft Data Access Components" (MDAC) package, which is actually a part of the Operating System. That is why the version number, 6.1, matches the Windows version number for Windows 7, which is also 6.1. The reason that your version of Microsoft Access is leading you to the folder is because it is the 32-bit version of Access so it can only use the 32-bit components. If you had the 64-bit version of Access (which, contrary to your assertion in the question, does actually exist), you would only be able to view the components in the non- directory. (The fact that you were able to fix your original problem by running a Windows Repair means that you had problems with your Windows installation, or possibly a corruption in a Windows Update while it was being installed. However, that has absolutely nothing to do with the presence of these two folders.) 

Microsoft is rolling out the download over time so they don't "overwhelm the Internet." You can skip the line and do the upgrade manually by downloading the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. However, it will install over your current partition. You cannot get it to activate your other partition. 

There are many ways you could implement this on a Linux server, but the simplest way is to use one of the many software packages designed expressly for this purpose. See, for example, the Linux Terminal Server Project or Open ThinClient. Alternatively, you can roll your own using an RDP server. XRDP is one option, and it is available in the package managers of most major Linux distributions. 

However, I suspect that your second router is not actually in "Access Point Mode" if it really is giving out its own IP range using DHCP. Netgear's documentation that you linked to implies that this should not be the case. You can double-check whether your second router is in AP Mode by following these instructions from Netgear. If you determine that the router is actually still handing out IP addresses despite being configured in AP Mode, the first thing I would do is check for a firmware update. If there is no firmware update, or if the newest firmware does not correct this issue, then I would conclude that the "AP Mode" setting is broken and I would follow the LAN-to-LAN instructions to which you linked. 

This has happened when clicking "Upgrade" inside the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and has also happened when running the installer from a flash drive. However, that flash drive did successfully install Windows 10 on another computer. How can I fix this? This computer is a Lenovo ThinkPad T530 which originally shipped with Windows 8 (basic), was upgraded to Windows 8 Pro, and then to Windows 8.1 Pro. When I run NirSoft's product key retrieval tool, it shows the original Windows 8 key stored by Lenovo in the BIOS as well as the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade key. Could it be that the upgrader has "decided" that these keys are not eligible for upgrade? 

You don't need to wait for the icon to show up in order to do an upgrade. You can do the upgrade manually by downloading the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. However, you shouldn't need to upgrade at all. If you successfully upgraded to Windows 10 from your old Windows 7 install, you should be able to do a clean install because Microsoft now recognizes your computer as one that is allowed to have Windows 10. You can use the same tool linked above to make a DVD of the Windows 10 installer or put the installer on a USB flash drive. When you boot from that DVD/USB, it will give you the option to do a clean install. 

Since the M71e is still under warranty, I called Lenovo support and asked them. They told me that the BIOS has a whitelist of PCIe cards that it will accept, and that the M90p obviously has a less-restrictive list. So, in short, this is by design! 

Any device that is connected to the extender will receive an IP address that is only valid on the extender but not on the main router. If you connect to the wireless while closer to the extender (thus getting an IP from the extender's range) and then move closer to the main router, your device may try to switch to the main router but use its previous IP address, which is not valid on this router. (Without seeing your exact configuration, this is harder to determine -- it may or may not actually be an issue.) If you are trying to do file sharing, or media streaming (AirPlay/ChromeCast) between devices on the two different wireless access points, you may have trouble, and it may not work at all. 

A simple way to script this is with Selenium. You can use their Firefox "Test Recorder" plugin to record a test of yourself logging in to the network, and then play back the test. 

3. Keyboard Shortcuts Get familiar with the keyboard shortcuts. You will usually find them significantly faster than using the mouse. (You will also easily impress people who are watching you who wonder how you are "doing stuff" so fast.) In addition to the ribbon hotkeys I mentioned above, many commands have their own dedicated shortcut keys. You can see what these shortcut keys are in the command button tooltips (when you hover the mouse over a button). If you don't see them, make sure the feature is enabled in "Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Display" -> "Show shortcut keys in ScreenTips". 

In Microsoft Office 2013, saving documents on SkyOneDrive is fully integrated into Word. On a computer using Word 2013, I wrote a document and saved it into a folder in my OneDrive. When I went to a computer with Office 2010, I logged into the OneDrive web interface, intending to go to that document and click "Open in Word" to continue editing it. However, I was unable to find the document. After some thought and investigation, I realized that the "folder" in which I had saved the document wasn't a folder at all - it was actually a OneNote notebook! However, opening that OneNote notebook, both in the OneDrive web interface and in the OneNote desktop application shows no sign of the Word document. The only hint that the document is there is the following message in the Notebook properties: "This notebook also contains sections in other formats" - when, in fact, the notebook actually only has one section. 

Now that Windows 10 has been officially released, you don't need to worry about the Windows 10 icon that was there. You can download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and run it whenever you are ready to do the upgrade. 

UPDATE I have now tested both cards in a ThinkCentre M90p (despite the model number, it's about a year older). The SuperMicro card does not work in that one, but the HP card does work. (So it could be that the SuperMicro card is dead, but that doesn't explain why the HP card works in one machine but not the other.) 

One login feature of Windows 10 is that it allows you to log in with a PIN instead of with your password. This is especially useful for those of us who have complex Microsoft Account passwords but just want to discourage casual laptop use by other people in the home/office. While the PIN defaults to be numbers only, the Windows 10 Preview builds had a checkbox to turn off "Simple PIN" mode and allow the use of letters and symbols in the PIN. In the preview builds, I used this feature. I can't seem to find this checkbox in the Windows 10 release. Did they move it somewhere else, or remove it entirely? My Windows 10 testing Virtual Machine, which already had a complex PIN (with letters) set when the Preview was installed is continuing to use that PIN now that it has upgraded to the full version. However, on my laptop which has been upgraded from Windows 8.1, I can't seem to set it. 

Open 'Settings' and scroll down. If you see a link to 'Show advanced settings...', click it. Click 'Content Settings' Scroll down to the 'Notifications' section and click 'Manage Exceptions'. 

It sounds like you are trying to pin a solution that is on your desktop to the Visual Studio Jump List. As you have found, that does not work because the Jump List loses focus and disappears when you click anything that is outside of it. What you need to do is open the solution once, so it appears in the Jump List under the "Recent" heading. Once it is there, mousing over it will show a "pin" icon (See screenshot below). Click the pin icon to pin the solution. 

There is nothing built into Word to do exactly what you want, but you can set it up yourself pretty easily. First, you need to create a Style that has the formatting you want. The easiest way to do that is to create a new style that is based on "Normal" but has the font set to a monospace font such as Courier New or Consolas. Then, you can assign a shortcut key to that style. To do that, go into the Style settings and choose "Shortcut Key" from the "Format" dropdown menu in the bottom left corner. 

No, you can't do this in Notepad++. Notepad++ is primarily a plaintext file editor, so it is not designed for fancy formatting of text (like Word or other "print media" tools). 

Your router likely doesn't support "NAT Reflection", also called "Hairpin NAT" or "NAT Loopback". This means that the requests to your public IP address from inside your own network are either not sent to the server at all or are sent to the server with the wrong "Respond-to" IP address, causing "Triangular Routing" which your computer can't handle. Your router may have a setting that allows you to turn on NAT Reflection. Otherwise, the only way to solve this is with "Split DNS" - setting up DNS in your network to return your server's private IP instead of its public IP. 

It turns out that the Windows 10 update turns on Hyper-V when it runs (I saw a source for this, which I can't find now). Going into "Programs and Features", choosing "Turn Windows features on or off", unchecking "Hyper-V", and rebooting solves the problem. 

When I log into Gmail for the first time in Chrome on my Windows 8 computer, Chrome asks if I want to use Gmail for links. When I click yes, Windows pops up a dialog to "Choose a program to use for links," with the only option being "Look in the Windows Store." When I go to the "Default Programs" => "Set Associations" window, there is no entry for . How can I set Gmail as the handler for links in Windows 8? 

First, powering your laptop over USB itself is likely to be impossible. Most modern laptops that I've seen take between 50 and 100 watts to charge, but USB itself doesn't typically allow more than 10W per port. Additionally, your laptop's USB circuitry likely won't accept power anyway. If you really want to physically redirect one of your USB ports to replace the power plug, I have a much better idea for you. Just replace the broken power plug with a new one that works! It's going to be much safer than trying to retrofit a USB port, and replacement power sockets are available for most laptops. All you need is a soldering iron, a steady hand, and a bunch of screw drivers (which are all the same things you would need if you wanted to do this to your USB port too). 

If you have an older version of Chrome that does not show this menu, you can find it in the settings: 

Often after I use certain Windows 8 (formerly "Metro") apps, usually about a day later, I notice a marked drop in available RAM over what I was expecting. Since I am running Virtual Machines that need the RAM, I go into Task Manager to reclaim it. I inevitably find multiple Windows 8 apps there, all with Status "Suspended", claiming to be using hundreds of MB each. The problem comes when I try to kill the processes of these applications. Each time I click "End task", my computer freezes completely for up to 3-4 minutes. This happens only when ending Windows 8 apps, not traditional apps. I also can only reproduce it consistently when using Task Manager, but I cannot get it to freeze when I end a process using Sysinternals Process Explorer. Note that this is after I have already "closed" the apps using one of the proper methods of closing a Windows 8 app - dragging to the bottom, right-clicking on the left-side thumbnail and choosing "Close", or using one of Win8 Update 1's new close buttons at the top of the screen or in the taskbar - it is already well-documented that apps do not close when you do those actions, instead going into "Suspended State". Has anyone dealt with this problem before? Have you been able to fix it?
