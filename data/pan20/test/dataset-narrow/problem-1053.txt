You are trying to access a remote site FROM your home network and it fails? Your Linksys shouldn't be blocking any outbound traffic... Assuming this isn't a PC or other internal problem since it works from a different Internet connection, the problem is with your ISP, not your equipment or configuration. 

Intel drivers are loaded, they recognize the chipset as Intel 4000. That is what you have No, it is not possible to "upgrade" the graphics. The graphics subsystem is built into the mainboard. If you want to upgrade it, you need to swap out the main board which would likely be more work and money than replacing the entire machine. No, for Intel 3000/4000 based graphics the system allocates memory automatically and you cannot statically assign memory available to the Intel graphics system like you can on newer chipsets. Most likely not, especially since 8GB should allow for the maximum amount of memory to be allocated to the graphics system. If you had 2GB of RAM then a jump to 8 or 16 would likely help, but going from 8 to 16 likely won't make much difference in graphics performance. 

Port 8443 is not official, but is often used as an alternative to 443 (HTTPS) in a similar fashion, and according to Wikipedia is also for

There are very specific tools to test cabling, they range from simple continuity testers for under $20 to highly advanced testing tools that costs thousands, even tens of thousands. But here are multiple things to check... 1) Take the computer (or any computer) to the router and connect it directly to it, do you get gigabit? 1A) Take a computer/laptop with a known working gigbit connection and connect a patch cord directly between it and your computer and check the connection speed, it should be 1000. 3) Check patch cords are at least CAT-5e (CAT-6 is not necessary for Gigabit), verify they have all 8 conductors since it is (was) common especially for inexpensive switch/router manufacturers to include a 4-conductor patch cord. Patch cords with only pins 1, 2, 3, and 6 will only support 100mbps. 3) Check the jack terminations, this is common fault area, especially when done by people who are not properly trained or informed. Structured Wiring How To has a good page on general information on cable termination. This video from Ideal Tools shows how "professionals" do the job. If you get to this point and everything looks fine, considering the tools you have available, I would do a simple continuity test, make sure each pin has continuity with each conductor having low resistance (14 ohms/100m is typical). TBH, if after all this things look fine, my next step is to assess the difficulty in replacing the cable... If I can do it in less than an hour or two, I just do it. If it is a wiring "mess" and difficult to replace, I may go back to the shop and get the Fluke meter to see if I missed something obvious. That being said, I have an HP Probook 650 laptop with Linux Mint and Windows 7 Pro on it, there are some switches out there that Mint will never establish a link to and Windows works fine, and I can't explain that, we have a couple Intellinet Gigabit switches in our test bench for testing devices and for some reason when I boot into Mint it will not connect to the switch and get an IP, but it works fine in Windows but if I connect to one of our infrastructure HP Procurve switches it works fine. 

So you have two hard drives, both have independent and bootable operating systems when connected individually? The answer here is to use your system BIOS/UEFI utility, which exact details vary quite a bit based on the manufacturer and implementation, but generally one or both of these methods apply: 1) On demand selection - Most computer have a way of selecting the boot device on each startup, often called "Boot menu" or something similar, the exact key combination to bring up this menu varies but it is often ESC, F2, F9, F10 or similar. This should bring up a utility or boot menu allowing you to select a drive to boot from. This is a one-time setting and will revert to default on the next startup. 2) Changing the BIOS boot priority order - This is done inside the BIOS/UEFI settings of the computer, again this varies by manufacturer, but there should a boot order menu entry allowing you to select which devices to boot in what order. You would change this to the be the order you wish such as: 1) Optical Drive 2) USB Removable Drive 3) HDD 0 4) HDD 1 5) Network and you would just change the order according to your need. It will search for a bootable device starting from the top and going down the list, you change this order as needed. This is persistent and survives a reboot. Just a few references... there are literally hundred available on Google by searching "change boot order" or "select boot device" or similar terms. You could narrow it down further by adding your model of PC, such as "Asus m5a97 select boot device". $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Not knowing how technical or detailed of an answer your looking for, I'll give a high level overview and some links. They enumerate the device (give it a number or ID on the USB bus), query it's requirements and identification, load device drivers and bring the device online to use. It's a simple process at its core. $URL$ $URL$ 

The USB 3.0 standard specifies it must be backwards compatible with USB 2.0. It will (should) work but only at 2.0 speeds. I would suggest purchasing a PCI or PCI-E 1x USB 3.0 card, they are relatively cheap and can be had for under $10 with a little due diligence, which will give you full USB 3.0 support. 

If you want your internal network device's to be able to talk to another distinctly separate network's internal devices across the public internet, you most likely need a VPN connection of some sort... either a soft client on your PC to a VPN server on the remote end or a hardware VPN (router to router), this would give you network access to devices on the remote network. Depending on your application, you may be able to use something like TeamViewer to take control of a remote machine to do what you need as well, it is generally less difficult to implement but make sure to check with the administrator for the remote network on their security policies. 

Both ends must be identical, a straight through connection. Pins 1, 2 3, & 6 are all that is used. On jack one connect the W-BL and W-Gr pairs like normal, on jack two place the W-BL where the W-O pair is marked and the W-Br where the W-Gr is marked. It's that simple. Note that all ports must be 10/100 only, if any port is a gig port, either on the switch or device, it will likely fail to function. Your best bet is to terminate the cable using CAT-6 standards and add a small switch to the remote end, eliminating any non-standard cabling issues. 

The DHCP server doesn't maintain a list of hostnames, but will maintain a DHCP Lease list, which would include the MAC address of the device and IP address that was assigned to it. Name resolution is something completely different.

You can't... Xbox 360 controllers do not support Bluetooth, they use a proprietary RF interface which requires a special USB dongle. There are specific, newer Xbox ONE wireless controllers that do support Bluetooth to PC, but you need to make sure to get the one with Bluetooth support as all Xbox One controllers do not support it.

According to the official specification sheet, unless there is an separate video card installed, this PC uses Intel HD 2000 graphics which is built into the processor. In HD 2000 graphics, there is no dedicated GPU memory but rather it uses shared system memory borrowing from normal RAM installed in the system up to the maximum allowed by the GPU (1696k in this case). There is no way to increase the GPU RAM and in many implementations you cannot control it in any way. On a good note, all of these models except the USFF chassis has a PCI-Express 16x slot allowing you to install an aftermarket half-height (sometimes called Low Profile) graphics card. There are multiple options available anywhere from $20 and up you could increase your graphics performance significantly, even a low end discrete card would increase your graphics capabilities tremendously. 

I run Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon and added several fonts through Software Manager, for specific example we will say the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package, but after installing the package successfully theyvli do not show up in Libreoffice Writer's font list. Is there something else I need to do so that I can use the fonts in Libreoffice? 

Windows XP does not have this function natively, you would need a third party utility to map a button to the SPACE function. Some possibilities are KeyTweak or SharpKeys 

If you have cleared your browser cache and does a and and not getting an IP address, the router is likely bricked. If you are getting an IP address, then attempt to access the router at $URL$ If the web page does not open or you are not getting an IP address, then attempt a reset using the instructions from Microcenter's tech support site. If a factory default does not work and return functionality to the unit, then the flash is corrupted and the device is likely "bricked", and as far as I can find the F303 does not have an emergency recovery mode to FTP/TFTP the firmware for disaster recovery. There is some mention in the F311 being recoverable after soldering in a USB Serial uart for communications to the unit as described here, so I would image an even lower end router would be similar, if it is possible at all. This is a sub-$20 router from multiple vendors (here and here are examples, NOT shopping recommendations), unless you have the equipment and expertise handy I would suggest replacing the unit. 

You can also the cli for Network Manager GUI, with the command to list the interfaces available, their type, connection state, and general connection "name" 

Your setup is not a wireless bridge, just a way of using the wireless medium to carry a network connection to another router, the second "router" should be setup as a bridge to pass-thru all network traffic, making this all one subnet with one router handling all DHCP and routing functions for the entire LAN. This is called a Client-Bridge configuration and is a common DD-WRT application. $URL$ 

I tried to make a network diagram, but failed miserably... Sorry Basically what you want to do is either get a commercial grade, VLAN capable router, or get a router capable of running DD-WRT or OpenWRT firmware, which neither of your routers are capable of according to either website's hardware database. From this point there are multiple ways to configure this, but here is a a few general rules I use... Leave the router's default IP address as the "admin VLAN", you won't be accessing it from anywhere but when physically connected to port 1-3 of the router (I will explain port 4 later), leaving this as by default 192.168.1.0/24 and the router being 192.168.1.1 so it can be accessed for maintenance purposes. Then build the subnets/VLANs, the router will hold an IP address in EACH subnet, so it will have multiple IP address and DHCP scopes. In this example we will use VLAN 10 for your "DMZ" zone (not a real DMZ if you will have regular hosts, but it will work for this purpose) and VLAN 20 for your Private LAN. In the router you will build VLAN 10 and assign IP address of 192.168.10.1/24 to the router and build the DHCP scope accordingly, then do the same with VLAN 20 using 192.168.20.1/24 and another DHCP scope for that network. In the VLAN assignments, go to Ethernet port 4 and add VLAN 10 and 20 as tagged VLANs... this will be the "downlink" to the switch. In your managed switch, setup port 1 as untagged into VLAN 1 (you can skip this portion if security is a real concern, it would become an issue if there was a switch misconfiguration or it lost it's configuration), and allow tagged traffic on VLAN 10 and 20. Now map the ports as necessary as untagged into the necessary VLAN, so the port your MS Server is connected to will be untagged into VLAN 10, most of users will be connected to a switch port that is set as untagged into VLAN 20. In this scenario the router controls everything VLAN/subnet configuration related including inter-VLAN routing and port forwarding ("DMZ" assignments), and the switch basically handles the subnet assignments to individual hosts. So in a "text" picture this would look like: WAN side: ISP -> Cable Modem -> Router Transport side: Router port 4 (trunked with VLAN 1, 10, and 20) -> Switch Port 1 Switch side: Port X is assigned untagged VLAN based on network needed Then later, if you need to expand, you either setup another port on the router like port 4 and feed another another switch, or build another trunk port on the switch with the VLANs tagged and downlink to a similar port on the new switch. In no case is there a need for 2 routers in this scenario. You can adjust the IP addresses and subnet masks as needed, the ones I used are just for reference. 

The Elitebook 8470p/8570p came with either AMD Radeon or Intel graphics, not both, you have one or the other unlike some notebooks who contain both and use a switchable graphics technology. 

What does this all mean? PADx messages are PPPoE Discovery messages, normal as the connection is built up or torn down, you should not see them normally, it is an indication of a connectivity or configuration issue. PADI - PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation PADO - PPPoE Active Discovery Offer PADR - PPPoE Active Discovery Request PADS - PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation PADT - PPPoE Active Discovery Termination 

Looking up the MAC address in a database like $URL$ to see the vendor, this could narrow down the device. Or blacklist the MAC address so it can't get an IP address, or give it a static DHCP IP assignment that isn't valid and see who complains their device doesn't work. 

Coca Cola contains sugar, acid, water, and other ingredients that could damage the drives. I would thoroughly clean them with a 90%+ isopropyl alcohol solution available from most drug stores and allow then to dry out for several hours. As long as the cola did not sit on the drives for too long, they should be fine, but if the acid is allowed to sit in/near tiny connections on the PC board of the drives, they could be damaged. Just drying them with a paper towel is not sufficient because the acid could get under the chips on the board. 

No, it's not the same thing or good enough... a surge protector and a UPS (which has a built in surge protector) each require a grounded outlet. In most commercial environments it is not recommended (possibly even against fire code) to have a UPS connected to a power strip/surge protector or to "stack" surge protectors. These grounded 3-prong outlets have been code in the US for over 50 years, long before electronics like this were common. Check with a local electrician, in some cases you can loop the neutral to ground in a 3-prong outlet, giving a path to ground (although it isn't a clean path) but it may not meet electrical code in your area. If not, consider getting a single outlet added for your computer. In today's modern age, equipment with a ground plug need a ground and adding ONE outlet should not run thousands of dollars in most homes, a couple hundred maybe, but this is something most homeowners can do themselves with a $7 outlet and $20 box of wire. 

In this case, It's used to pass a parameter from the script command... For example, if you command was then in the script the % would be replaced with when the script was executed. 

Your ISP is using a Siligense SAS SGA441SW ONT, or Optical Network Terminal, to convert optical xDSL to Ethernet. It is performing both a media conversion (optical to copper) AND a protocol conversion of xDSL (which the standards can vary) to Ethernet (IEEE 802.3). A media converter as you linked in your original question will either not function at all, or will just produce an error as it is only doing half of the necessary requirement for connectivity, attempting to convert Optical Ethernet (which this is not) to Copper Ethernet, and making no provisions for the xDSL connectivity. These types of ONT devices are often only available from you ISP, or if you purchase them outside of your ISP they many need to be approved by them. Regardless, the optical or interface MAC address likely would need to be provisioned by your ISP prior to it being a functional replacement unit.
