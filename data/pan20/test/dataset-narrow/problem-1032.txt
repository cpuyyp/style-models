in your file and see if it helps. From my understanding the, problem occurs because when first launches it reads the environment variable and displays the interface in a "safe" manner to insure that everything it sends to the terminal (all of the escape codes) is supported and all the text will be readable. When the user causes a screen update (by pressing a key, switching modes, ect), it asks the terminal what features it actually supports and then re-displays everything with all of the extra features enabled. Setting to forces to assume that some of the more advanced escape codes (colored backgrounds, bold/italics, ect) are supported before querying the terminal. 

It moves only files in subfolders into their corresponding parent directories. To change the command to move all files in subfolders, adjust the argument to . 

As you know, when a computer needs to resolve a host to an IP address, it needs to contact a DNS server to query the hostname (unless it somehow already knows its IP address, ie: an entry in its file). This process happens very quickly, although there can be many steps depending on how your network or network is configured. By default, when you power on your router, it will ask your ISP for an IP address likely using the DHCP Protocol. When your ISP's DHCP server responds, it not only sends the IP address it has assigned to your router, but a list of DNS servers that are hosted on their network. Now, your router can resolve hostnames to IP addresses by querying those DNS servers, but what about computers on your that sit behind the router? When you fire up your computer, likely using the DHCP Protocol again, it will ask for an IP address. Your router will respond with an IP address, but instead of sending your ISP's DNS servers, it will send itself (the IP address on its interface) as the DNS server it would like your computer to use. Now, when you enter into your browser, your computer needs to resolve the hostname into an IP address so that it can make a request to the remote server(s). To do this, first it checks to see if it has resolved recently and if it is still cached on the local machine somewhere, as recalling the IP from RAM or local storage will more than likely be faster than asking a DNS server. If it isn't cached locally anymore, it asks your router's DNS server. The same procedure is carried out by your router: If it has resolved recently, it responds to your computer with what it has cached. If hasn't resolved recently, it queryies your ISP's DNS servers, which are external servers. To directly answer your question: Yes, when attempting to browse to a website by its hostname, unless your computer already knows its IP address by some other means, some (or many) external DNS servers will be queried in order to resolve that hostname to an IP address. 

Start your Java application in the session and then when you are ready to detach and let it run in the background, type Ctrl+A and then D. You can then safely disconnect from the SSH session. To re-attach to the screen session, execute: 

Do you want to leave the Java application running, even after you disconnect? If so, install . allows you to create persistent sessions allowing you to keep programs/scripts running in their own session even after you log out of SSH. If you're on Ubuntu or any Debian-based distro, installing is easy: 

Unfortunately what you are after is not possible. Unless you are paying for multiple static IP addresses from Comcast (Comcast Business plan), Comcast will only supply you with one WAN IP address. Your only option is to run the servers on separate ports. That said, if the servers you are hosting are HTTP (Web) servers, you can setup a "reverse proxy" that, depending on the hostname of the requested page, will route the incoming connections to the correct server. It is pretty easy to setup an Apache2 reverse proxy; do some research. 

Put together, matches with as many non- characters on either side of with an extension tacked onto the end. Given the string the above regex only matches . If a leaf-folder contains , for example: , it does not match because contains no followed by letters or numbers. 

To change the owner of and all of the subdirectories withen to so that Tranmission can write to the directory, execute the following as with the USB drive mounted: 

If the IP address is statically defined in the AP, it will not show up in the DHCP tables in the router. If your router exposes an ARP table, it will likely be listed. If not, the simple (and tedious) way of hunting it down is to ping every IP address in the subnet until you find it. A tool like can make this easier, and even tell you the MAC address for each device it finds and suggest the device's manufacturer. If you have physical access to the AP (likely, assuming this is your own home network) and are not too concerned with the current settings, you can reset the device to factory (check the manual for instructions; its probably just holding the reset button for 10 seconds or similar) and then connect to it with the default, factory IP address (also in the manual). 

If you do not have a card plugged into your second PCIe x16 slot (the white one) on your motherboard, there is no need to get an expensive card that can run all three displays. Simply purchase another graphics card and plug it in to drive the other two displays. Windows will allow you to extend your desktop to any displays plugged into either card. Unless you want to stretch a game across all three monitors, there is no need for Nvidia Surround or AMD Eyefinity. Since you already have a Nvidia card, I recommend not purchasing an AMD card so you do not have to have both Nvidia and AMD drivers installed. A Nvidia GT 610 will likely be the cheapest card you will be able to find to stick next to your 460. 

On page 7 of your motherboard manual there is a diagram for the ; specifically the group of pins labeled (it is where you plugged in the HDD LED & power/reset switches). The diagram shows a and a next to each pin for each of the LEDs/Switches. The single green wire is the positive () wire, and the black is ground (); both must be connected for the LED to function. Because LEDs are diodes, they only allow current to pass though one way; this is why the wires need to be connected in the "right direction" unlike a switch where polarity does not matter. 

Linux is obviously not going to support mounting a Windows 8 storage pool (at time of writing), and even if it did, it is very unlikely that any live-migration could be performed from an NTFS-formatted Win8 storage pool to a Linux-readable array. The safest (and only?) option is either purchase enough new drives or find enough spare drives to house all of the data while you get Linux installed and an array configured (hardware RAID, software RAID, or ZFS). Then, move all of the data onto the new array. Something to keep in mind though: If you spread all of the data across as few new and/or spare drives as possible, you have a single point of failure. If any drive dies before you copy the data back off of it into your array, you lose whatever data you had on that drive. Optimally, to ensure the most data security throughout the transition, important data should reside on at least two drives while the migration is being performed. 

By the looks of it, Bitbucket has a wildcard DNS entry in place; any random subdomain () will resolve to the same server(s) as . 

Another option is to maximize the window (again, by right-clicking it on the taskbar) and then drag the window down from the top of the screen. It will snap back to its larger size, although you will have the "top bar" visible so it will be resizeable. 

Hold Shift and right-click the icon in the taskbar. Select . Without using the mouse, use the arrow keys to move the window back on screen. 

You can use a tool like AutoHotKey to rebind it to another unused key, which won't allow capslock to be enabled and thus disable the light. I recommend reading the AutoHotKey Tutorial for more information on how to get started. 

Onboard RAID5 usually performs very poorly. The Intel ICH10R (the onboard SATA controller that is usually paired with the x58 chipset) does not do the parity calculations, they get offloaded to your CPU. If you want to continue using RAID with the onboard controller, I recommend RAID1 or RAID10. Both lack parity (RAID1 is a simple mirror, RAID10 is a striping across mirrors) and will provide much better performance. If you want to continue to use RAID5, ditch your onboard SATA controller and get a proper RAID card. You will see much better performance (even faster than a single-disk in most cases). 

Right-click on the desktop > Confirm that you are in the Control Panel, not the "Wizard" Switch to in the upper-left (instead of ) Click > Un-check Apply/OK 

I had the same problem on my Lenovo X220. I solved it by disabling "Adaptive Contrast Enhancement" in the Intel Graphics Control Panel. To get there: 

The bandwidth specs on your router's spec sheet are in . One contains eight . To calculate the number of , the unit of measure you are reporting, simply divide the spec by . Your router only has ports. is roughly . of throughput (what you are getting) is very normal; cannot be reached due to overhead and other factors. To get around this without purchasing a new router, you simply need a gigabit switch (~ theoretical bandwidth). Plug the switch into one of the router's ports and then connect your devices into the switch instead of the router. Example of a gigabit switch: $URL$ Note that Gigabit switches are also commonly labled as switches and/or switches. 

That seems to work for me. The extension match can be reduced if you know all of your extensions lack numbers or if you know all of the files you want to match have a specific extension. 

ZFS On Linux (ZOL) has come a long way in the past year or so. The developers have claimed it is production-ready with its recent v0.6.1 release. I've been running ZOL at home (still a pretty heavy workload, though) for a while now and I've had no problems. A lot of other people stand by ZOL as well. That said, using ZOL as the root (or ) partition is tricky. It is doable, although probably not worth your time. I believe that the Arch wiki has information about it. The easiest path for you to take (in my option) would be to install Ubuntu on a separate boot drive (or mirror), install ZOL (from source or from the PPA), and simply your existing ZFS pool. Something to keep in mind: ZOL does not implement some of the most recent features of zpool (like encryption, among other things). It will likely warn you (and possibly block you) from mounting a pool that contains features that ZOL does support. Just in case, make a backup of the important data prior to trying to import it. I doubt anything bad will occur if it fails, but playing it safe is always good! 

Note: The above is a very simplified outline, and should be treated as such. The process can be different depending on how the network and the computer attempting to resolve the hostname are setup. For further information on DNS and how the protocol works, you can start with checking out the Wikipedia entry on DNS and/or doing further research. 

The user shouldn't need to mount the USB drive. By adding that line to the file, the USB drive will be automatically mounted when the Pi boots up. The problem you are experiencing is with permissions. The user is likely the owner of , unless you explicitly changed it. This means that, unless the permissions have been altered for the directory, only can create new files/folders within. This can be verified with 

I was very curious after reading this question, so I started to research to see if it was possible. After some digging I arrived at : $URL$ works quite well in my (very) brief testing. Hopefully it is what you're after. 

If you regularly keep your laptop plugged in, your best option is to keep the battery out. When the battery completely charges, just remove it from the laptop (if it is easily acceptable) and keep the AC adapter plugged in. If the laptop seems sluggish when the battery has been removed, it is because some laptops force a low-power state without the battery plugged in. If this is the case, your manufacturer more than likely sells a high-power adapter that will let the laptop run in a full-power state without the battery.
