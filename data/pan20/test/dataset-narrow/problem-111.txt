Showing longer-prefixes on your matching route will show the VRF names. `sh ip route vrf * 192.0.2.0 longer-prefixes'. 

All lines configured in your VLAN take the DHCP broadcast from the client, add the router's (gateway) address into the UDP packet, then unicasts to the DHCP servers. [I'm sure the packet rewrite is only done once, then a copy sent to each DHCP server.] All the listed servers configured receive the DHCPDiscover packet by the router relay. The redundancy of your DHCP servers not only depends on your OS, but the specific version! For Windows that was mentioned, your options range from a true split-scope in Windows 2008 R2 to active-failover redundancy in Windows 2012. For not-so-robust DHCP servers (i.e., Windows 2003), you can manually configure a split-scope. Common recommendation is the 80/20 rule with 80% of the leases configured on what you (and you alone) consider your primary DHCP server and 20% and the secondary. Exclusions get added to each DHCP server as they have overlapping scopes. As I'm not a fan of overlapping scopes in Windows 2003 as the exclusions tend to get hidden from view, I prefer to simply split the subnet in half for each DHCP server. A /24 block for client leases becomes two /25 blocks. They key is the subnet mask in the scope is still a /24. Your start and end IP addresses in the range configured in the scope follows the /25. Now I do recommend some exclusions for network devices like VLAN interface IP addr's and HSRP as well as some for static devices (e.g. printers) in the same subnet. So I exclude the first 16 (0-15) addresses -- zero address wouldn't be used, of course, anyway -- and exclude the top 16 (240-255) -- 255 broadcast, of course. You can actually get away with not configuring the exclusion by simply starting and ending the IP address appropriately. The basic scope information in a manually configured 50/50 split-scope (2x/25=/24) is similar to: 

I have an HP ProCurve 2910al (J9146A) and I am being requested to drop connections or timeout connections with half-open TCP connections. I am having trouble finding commands or even understanding what half-open TCP connections are. My ports on the switch are set with port-security to specific MAC addresses. What commands can I use on my switch to drop or timeout half-open TCP connections? 

After talking with multiple people and Black Box here is what fixed the issue. First on the Dell the native VLAN on the trunk port 32 needed to be set to 1 (default) On the Black Box switch the Trunk Port (port 16) needed to be set as a C-Port and then the switch had to be restarted. PVID on Black Box switch remains at 2. Special thanks to @RonTrunk for his help on this answer. 

The ICMP response is an entirely separate unicast message from a router to the original source used in the traceroute. The formation of the ICMP error packet is independent of the original traceroute packet headers that triggered the error except in determining where to send the error message. If TTL=1 for each of the ICMP messages trying to get back to your traceroute client, only the message from the first hop would make it back. 

The best you can usually do is look for communities with your provider that allow you to indicate prepends per peer of your provider. This assumes your provider has such communities and has the peering relationships for this to work. Prepending your own announcements to your peer would have no variation upstream from your provider. Though this method does not alter localpref one AS removed from your provider, it has similar impact in making that path back to you less desirable. There is an exception to influencing localpref upstream that I'll describe at the bottom, though it's probably an edge case. Some providers such as XO [AS2828] allow you to advertise your prefixes in such a way that your provider announces your routes with with specific prepends for certain peers of theirs. For example, XO accepts: prepends once for AT&T prepends twice for Level3 preprends thrice for Sprint On Savvis, the community is which prepends once for AT&T. These providers usually have communities to indicate the well-known communities of NO_EXPORT or NO_ADVERTISE to specific peers. One Tier 2 provider I know, InterNAP, is able to influence localpref upstream because they buy transit, so they are a customer of the Tier 1's. They have communities that you could use where they attempt to translate those into specific Tier 1 communities for your upstream advertisements which set localpref to peer-, mid-, or high-level values. See $URL$ Example References: XO Communities that Change Customer Announcements to Certain Peers at AS2828 Border Savvis Prepend Community Attributes I have no affiliation with the providers used in the examples other than direct experience as a customer. 

I have a Dell N3132PX running 6 different VLANs. (192.xxx.xxx.10) VLAN 2 is my management VLAN for my switches. VLAN 3 is my DHCP network running production level for users. Port 25 (Untagged) VLAN 2 PVID 2 is where my server with my DHCP is running Active Directory and DNS. Port 32 is my Trunk Port (Tagged) PVID 1. (As far as I understand all VLANs should be running through here). Port 32 Trunk runs to a Black Box LGB2118A 18 port switch (192.xxx.xxx.13). This connection is made at Port 16 Trunked (Tagged) PVID 1. I have 2 computers on ports 11 & 12 VLAN 2 (Untagged) PVID2 plugged in. Problems: 1. Black Box switch cannot ping Dell Switch. 2. Computers cannot ping server or access server. Do I have my trunk port setup incorrectly? I have double checked all the options and definitions of trunking an I feel I might be missing something or have something configured incorrectly. I would post the configs to the question but the websense here is blocking me to adding files to any website to do so. Happy to add more information if needed. EDIT: Adding requested Port Information: 

To get to the heart of your question, a single L3 (layer 3) switch could do what you want and be divided into logical networks via VLANs and the switch will handle the routing between the networks though this is far from an optimal solution. Each VLAN interface will have an IP address configured which becomes the default gateway for all devices it serves. Although not recommended for several reasons with security at the top, your Internet connection could even technically connect on the same switch and work, but that's asking for trouble; I'm sure this is why your consultant recommended at least 1 switch and and 1 router so the two are separated. You really should have a firewall between the two or at least firewalling functionality on your router. Ideally, you would hare pairs routers, firewalls, and switches for redundancy and separation of functions to provide security boundaries. 

EDIT: After setting PVID on Black Board Switch to 2 I can now ping the Dell switch from the Black Box switch on VLAN2. Problem remaining is that I can't ping the server through the switch on VLAN 3 NOR get a valid address through my DHCP on VLAN 3. Here are the Black Box settings. This switch has now CLI. 

Computer trying to access the server on VLAN 3 is plugged into Port 9 on the Black Box switch above. 

Found the answer to this by calling the manufacturer. On the Black Box switches the ports for trunks had to be set to C-PORTs and the PVID has to be set to the management VLAN. All check in now correctly. 

Your ip-helper is the correct way to do this for redundancy and is the recommended method. The DHCPDiscovery (broadcast) gets picked up by the ip-helper and then unicasts to each DHCP server with the relay-agent (the router) in the request. Usually the first DHCP server to respond wins. Both DHCP servers can (and should) make DCHPOffers to the client. It's the client that decides which one to keep and then sends a DHCPRequest (unicast) to the server that offered it for the IP it wants to use. The server needs to DHCPAck that request to complete the process. For redundancy, but to not violate the DHCP rule of not having overlapping scopes defined for your IP pools, you need two ip-helpers. Since the DHCP servers are not aware of one another, the IP pools must be unique. A common method for DHCP redundancy is to take your typical /24 subnet and divide it into two /25s for your scopes (one per server). Example: 192.0.2.0/24 is your actual network, so you divide it into 192.0.2.0/25 and 192.0.2.128/25. So the roughly 256 addresses are cut into two pools of 128 addresses and assigned to each DHCP scope. Now you have no overlapping addresses + redundancy. Since cutting your scope pool in half, make sure the servers can support your entire network if one DHCP server were to fail. Consider the lease-time to be the duration that clients can retain their addresses where you won't exhaust your pool if you have many rotating clients, yet be able to give you enough time to detect and fixed a failed DHCP server. 

SO I am building a network of 6 switches. 1 primary switch would feed a trunk of 4 VLANs to 5 other switches directly (i.e. all coming from the primary switch). To keep the switches secure I want to put them on their own Management VLAN. If I am going from one switch to another to carry my initial 4 VLANs can I TAG the 5th VLAN for network management to travel on the same trunk? And also when the trunk port meets the destination VLAN would you still be able to access the switch directly through the trunk port or would would you need a second ACCESS line connection the two switches?
