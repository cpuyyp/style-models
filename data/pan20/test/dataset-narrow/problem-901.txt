If the sender of the auto-forwarded email is Alice while the recipient is Bob, then it IS from Alice's mailbox to Bob's mailbox. In this situation, use the MFCMAPI to check or clear the mailbox rules. Also, ensure the affected user's Outlook is not running, then send a test email to her, see if the message will be forwarded to Bob. If not, maybe the Outlook add-in causes the issue. Running Outlook in safe mode(Running Outlook.exe /safe), or manually disable add-ins to find the one causing this issue. If the sender of the auto-forwarded email is not Alice but the original sender, it would be another story. Search the message tracking log and pipeline trace would be helpful. 

Bu default, Outlook on domain clients can connect to Exchange Autodiscover service with AutodisscoverInternalURI setting on CAS servers(by running Get-ClientAccessServ er | fl), regardless of the mailboxes' SMTP Address suffix. So easy. No other additional configuration is needed, and it avoids any other problems caused by additional configurations. If you have any concern that GPO for autodiscover must be used, you may share it with us, we can try to help or workaround. 

I followed this KB to disable SMBv1 server and client with Group Policy. After that, my DC seems down as I got many error that no AC server is founded in my domain. I then found the workstation service cannot be started, it said "Windows could not start the Worksation service on Local Computer. Error 2: The system cannot find the file specified". The registry I changed are here: $URL$ However, even I deleted these new created registry keys, I still cannot get my DC back. This is the only DC in my environment. Help!! 

I tried your steps and got same error message in PowerShell as you shared. The different thing is, I also got error when grant this shared mailbox permission to other mailboxes' Calendar via Outlook client. The error message is "Non-local users cannot be given rights on this server". I tried local mailbox and O365 mailbox. In both scenarios, this shared mailbox (and other local mailboxes) appears as not available: 

If you got the error when modifying the permission via EAC, please try to use EMS to add/delete the user permission on Public Folders. Or please schedule a downtime to reboot all Exchange 2013 servers(CAS & Mailbox) to fix the issue. PS: This error would occur if there are some bad requests in the background. 

Secondly when I removed the sendy-newsletter configuration from and folders, as expected I could restart the nginx server successfully but strangely when I ran I get the same error message as before but the server works!? 

I'm not really sure what this block was doing or what means, I'm sure I just took it off someones blog who recommended it. Any idea what it is doing? Below is my full NGINX configuration file, thanks in advance for any help and advice you may have :) server { # Listen on port 80 as well as post 443 for SSL connections. listen 8080; #listen 443 default ssl; 

Ok was the error log was totally throwing me off, and had nothing to do with the underlying issue. The issue was caused by Magento & HHVM not working well together. In the end I solved it simply by adding the following to my /etc/hhvm/server.ini file. 

How do I ensure we are using the correct protocol & SHA? Is this something I change in the new nginx configuration file? 

Which CRT file should I reference for NGINX, what about the other one? 3. SSL 3.0 & SHA1 When I check our site on DigiCert's SSL checker it says: 

I'm trying to allow another developer to connect to a our ubuntu server and they are getting the below error in FileZilla. 

I had NGINX running fine on my local machine and tried to install the Google Page Speed module by first uninstalling nginx and following the re-installing from source as Google suggests. Now NGINX won't start, and I can't access any of the sites I have set up locally for development. There is nothing in my error logs, yet I can see I have the /etc/nginx/ directory with all the configuration files I had before. Any idea how I can get things working again? I tried re-installing but still no joy :( 

I stopped and started our Dev EC2 instance, I just wanted to test something. Now when I try to access our web app via the new AWS Public DNS I get an error. 

I'm such a dope, forgot I had varnish running on the other application so port 80 was in use. That was the issue, the error logs pointed me in the right direction while the nginx -c just confused me. 

It might not be Software Protection Service related. It's just doing what it should do when an application starts. Try to start Outlook in safe mode first, see if the issue is caused by any add-ins. If issue persists, try to setup the mailbox on another Outlook client or mailbox application, check the result. Also, compare these affected items with other normal mail items, maybe all of these affected items include some specific objects\links\attachments\etc.. 

Move the file to another location, such as D:\, then try again. I ever encountered similar issues when loading file from root system drive C:\, moving it to another drive fixed the issue. 

Enable mailbox audit log against the affected mailbox. Then, if the issue happens again, check the audit log for details. Enable Audit log for a mailbox: Set-Mailbox -Identity user1 -AuditDelegate Create, HardDelete, Move, MoveToDeletedItems, SoftDelete,SendAs,SendOnBehalf -AuditEnabled $true Search the audit log: Search-MailboxAuditLog -Identity user1 -ShowDetails -LogonTypes Admin,Delegate,Owner -StartDate 7/1/2017 -EndDate 8/1/2017 | fl >C:\mbaudit.txt   Note: You can modify the StartDate and EndDate with the actual data. $URL$ 

Exchange back end site in IIS uses 81 for http and 444 for https. The default website use 80 and 443. If you install CAS role and Mailbox role on seperated servers, telnet 80 and 443 on CAS server while telnet 81 and 444 on mailbox server. If users are able to access OWA and ECP, it means there is no problem about network connection or binding issues. If OWA or ECP doesn't work, analysis IIS logs and application logs for clues. 

Exchange 2010 does not support Windows Server 2016 Active Directory servers. Re-setup an Windows server 2012 R2 or previous Windows server, then check the result. Also, if it is a new organization, it's best to re-setup the domain environment, then install Exchange 2010 server. See: Exchange Server Supportability Matrix 

Stop and disable the search services and rename the Data Folder "C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Bin\Search\Ceres\HostController\Data" Rename all index folders (Mailbox\_Catalog\12.1.Single) Open power shell and navigate to C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Bin\Search\Ceres\Installer Run the command: .\installconfig.ps1 -action I -dataFolder "c:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Bin\Search\Ceres\HostController\Data" Start the “Microsoft Exchange Search” Service 

Click Other option which is listed as the last one in Option page, then click Go to the earlier version in the right pane. You will see groups in the list. Select groups, then you will be able to check and edit the groups you own. Make sure you select the MyDistributionGroups and MyDistributionGroupMembership for the new role assignment policy, like below: 

And then updating /etc/sudoers so that the ubuntu user must give their password when running a command. To edit this file you must run and add: 

I had one nginx configuration set up and working fine in . Today I've tried to add another for the sendy email marketing app based on this configuration. After running the command failed I checked online and found that should highlight any sytax errors, it gave the following result. 

Which is odd as I'm not used to comments in public keys or line breaks? We've tried using her public key with & witout the comment & line breaks. I've added it to like this: 

I'm moving a site to a new server running on NGINX. The old site's Apache2 VirtualHost has configured that I want to replicate in the NGINX configuration. From what I've read on the NGINX Docs this seems to be simply achieved with . I just want to make sure what I have is correct. From APACHE2 

Our staging server is on an Amazon EC2 instnace. When you ssh into it you can execute a command or without having to enter a password. Is there anyway I can require a password from a user when they try a command with ? I have a 3rd party dev who needs access and I want to restrict root privileges for them. I tried setting a password with but I still don't require a password. 

Can I just copy these to a location on the new server and reference them in the NGINX configuration file? Or do I need to generate a new ssl key, re-key the crt file(which one)? 2. NGINX CONFIGURATION The NGINX configuration only seems to need reference to two files Apache does? 

I'm a but of a newbie to systems admin & redis configuration and am trying to figure our how to optimize redis. We are running a Magento eCommerce app on an AWS m3.large EC2 instance with redis and the backend caching seems quote slow. Up to 15 seconds for TTFB on some pages. The Root device type of our ec2 instance is ebs. When I look at the info command output from the redis CLI I see: 

I resolved it myself. Not sure why, but i ran the command sc.exe config lanmanworkstation depend=bowser/mrxsmb10/mrxsmb20/nsi and sc.exe config mrxsmb10 start=disabled Reboot the server; then run sc.exe config lanmanworkstation depend=bowser/mrxsmb20/nsi After reboot the server again, now I can start the workstation service and other services now. my DC is back! 

1# General mobile devices use ActiveSync to connect to Exchange server. 2# No such bridge between different services. 3# Different protocols are for different services. For example, EWS service is mainly responsible for free/busy, OOF, mailtips and Outlook for Mac connection. ActiveSync is for mobile devices to access. RPC/HTTP and MAPI/HTTP are for Outlook connection. But it doesn't mean that only one protocol is needed for a specific client. For example, even when the Outlook connects to Exchange via RPC/HTTP, it will connect to EWS service when querying free/busy data. Actually, all of the protocols you mentioned above are based on HTTPS, they use the same port TCP 443 and same certificate(binding with IIS service on Exchange server). And we always use the same namespace for Outlook Anywhere, ActiveSync, EWS service, OAB virtual directory and MAPI/HTTP, such as mail.domain.com. For the internal clients, there would be no need to limit these services. For the external clients, make sure to publish the namespace autodiscover.domain.com, mail.domain.com, and the MX records. If you have firewall or proxy server, you may need to set the rule to publish these services. You can google the document related to the firewall/proxy setting you plan to use. Here is a blog about client access in Exchange 2013, for your reference: $URL$ Hope the above information helps.:) 

Enabled -> specifies whether the Sender ID agent is enabled on the computer on which you're running the command. ExternalMailEnabled -> specifies whether all messages from unauthenticated connections external to your organization are passed through the Sender ID agent for processing. InternalMailEnabled -> specifies whether all messages from authenticated sender domains that belong to authoritative domains in your enterprise are passed through the Sender ID agent for processing. So if the Enabled is set to false, none of the ExternalMailEnabled setting or InternalMailEnabled setting works. 

Besides, Exchange 2016 only supports MAPI\HTTP and RPC\HTTP, and MAPI\HTTP is the default connection method. After you disabled MAPI\HTTP, Outlook will connect to Exchange via RPC\HTTP, so you will still see HTTP in the Outlook connection status. 

We're swicthing from an OSCommerce website to Magento and are also swicthing servers. The old server is on Apache and our new one is on NGINX. The SSL certificate we have seems to have been purchased from GODADDY. I've almost figured out how to switch our SSL certifcate from our old server to our new server. But have a few questions? 1. REKEY CERTIFICATE I've discovered three types of SSL files from the old OSCommerce site apache virtual host: 

The issue with this now is that my file is now accessible. How can I rewrite this block better? What does mean? ISSUE 2 I was getting a 404 error on URLs such as: 

Now I'm asked for a password but the one which I set does not work! Luckily I created an AMI before I started any of this. Could the issue be that I don't have a password set for the user, I should I have run rather than . 

Got it working I had to replace the /etc/nginx directory with a backup I took of it before I tried anything with ngx-pagespeed. Now it works as before but pity ngx-pagespeed did not work. 

Also I notice that in the browser address bar the public DNS I entered changes back to the old Public DNS we had before, even on machines I never accessed the our app from before. I can access the site if I add a host entry to my local PC with the public IP address. Any idea what could be causing this? UPDATE I tried rebooting and got a 502 bad gateway error but once I restarted the NGINX server it went away but I still get the connection time out. 

We have a magento store which appends a query to our URL when you change Magento store views on the frontend. i.e. $URL$ Is there a way to remove the ?___store=uken with NGINX configuration? Say remove any query beginning with ?___store=. I'm very new to server config & nginx in particular. 

Two things confused me about this, first off I don't understand why the server block would not be allowed, after checking online it seems that this can be caused if config files are not included in the block of my , but they are:
