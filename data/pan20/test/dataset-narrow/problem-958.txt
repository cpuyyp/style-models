You have arranged that some process is using those user-ids. You should arrange for that process to set it's umask to 022. How you do this depends on what process you have arranged to do this. Perhaps you use , perhaps it is a web-server, perhaps it is something else. Unless you explain, it isn't really possible to provide detailed specific advice. 

Dynamic IP-address allocation (central management) If your Banana-Pi gets its IP-address from a DHCP service (e.g. on your router) then it has the opportunity to inform the DHCP server of its hostname. The DHCP service often has the facility to inform the DNS service (e.g. also on the router) of this. Otherwise your Banana-Pi may be assigned some default hostname. Static IP-address allocation If your Banana-Pi has a static IP-address locally configured, it won't ask the DNS server (via DHCP) to add its name to its data. Fixed IP using DHCP reservation If you want your Banana-Pi to have a fixed IP-address, you can configure a DHCP reservation on the router and reconfigure the Banana-pi to use DHCP. how you configure a DHCP reservation depends on the router make and model. Administratively, this is the simplest solution. The router will then always allocate the same IP-address to the Banana-Pi and will update the DNS service with the Banana-Pi's current hostname. 

Download the manual from Yuraku support. You'll need to know the model number (which will be on it somewhere, perhaps at the back). It would have been better to include the model number in your question. 

In some circumstances, paste-special can help. One of the choices (In Win7 at least) is "Unformatted text". 

Only a lawyer can answer that. First you need to work out which jurisdiction applies. I see nothing obvious in GitHub's terms of service that say you can only use GitHub for collaborative software development. I am not a Lawyer. 

I run gVim by clicking an icon on my desktop or by using "edit with vim" from the context menu in Windows explorer. If you want to invoke vim from a Windows command prompt you either need to have the path to vim.exe added to %PATH% or type the full path (e.g. 

That screen is displayed by the motherboard BIOS, it is probably not something you can change. I would press Del and see what options (if any) are available. 

This makes me wonder if the author has perhaps not tested it on Windows 7 - perhaps there is some quirk of Windows-7 that the author has not accommodated? Perhaps softy has some quirk that needs to be dealt with by the developer? TTF file format Perhaps there is an issue in the TTF cmap table for your font. See $URL$ 

Yes and no Microsoft provide Virtual PC which allows you to run Windows XP (I don't know about Vista) inside Windows 7 

Normally NAT applies to all IP-addresses in the LAN. So I don't understand the problem. The router which is doing the NAT remembers which of it's port numbers are associated with which internal IP-addresses + port numbers. 

That is probably not possible because the starring and other data is stored by Picasa separately from the photos using a mechanism that, so far as I know, isn't designed for multiple concurrent users. You can share photos using Picasa Web Albums (the online service) but, so far as I know, Google haven't released the server code for that. Someone has worked out a way to share Picasa data between multiple PCs but it ends with this warning: 

UNIX is a trademark of the Open Group (formerly X/Open). You may only use the name Unix for a system that has been certified by the Open Group as meeting their "Single Unix Specification (SUS). They say: 

Your "default gateway" is the "ADSL Router Modem" in the disgram above. If you only have a ADSL modem, the default gateway would be a router at the point of entry into the ISP network. In this part of the world, ISPs give away ADSL-routers (ie switch+wap+router+firewall+modem in one small box) for free, I haven't seen a plain USB-ADSL-modem for years. Your Mileage May Vary. Basically, The IP pathway over ADSL provided via your phone line (or cable) arrives at a router in the ISP premises before it gets anywhere near the rest of the intertubes. 

If you have administrative access to the server an HTTP relay will do what you want. You can use Socat 

I suspect there's not any PC-DOS code in Windows 8, maybe not even for compatibility purposes. There is a clear progression from DOS to Windows 8 though. This is not really the case with Unix and Linux. 

The best method is to restore the file from one of your daily or weekly backups. The second best way is probably to use something like Recuva. Tools like this probably can't recover the overwritten sectors but might find an older version of the text file if you are very lucky and edited the file a lot. 

You can certainly simulate an Ethernet switch. Just as you can simulate a network. Simulations tend to run slower than the real thing. Whatever the bottleneck is that affects your downloads, adding a simulation burden to the computer seems unlikely to help. 

Socat is netcat on steroids. If you can use socat, see Securing Traffic Between two Socat Instances Using SSL 

Promiscuous mode was more useful in the days of thin-net and Ethernet hubs. You are right that an Ethernet switch learns which MAC addresses are connected to which ports and segregates traffic accordingly. Some switches allow one port to be used as a monitoring port, all traffic passing throughthe switch is also transmitted to that port. 

Surge protectors are designed to protect the equipment from voltage surges in the supply, typically they block or divert the supply at voltages over 3xnominal (e.g. at 330V on a normally 110V supply). The typical threat is a lightning strike on the power line nearby. "An average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of about 30,000 to 100,000 amperes (30-100 kA) at a voltage of over a billion volts." (Wikipedia) Of course this is much reduced by the time any voltage surge reaches your surge protector but this is the type of event for which surge protectors were intended. A Laser printer, or other device, drawing a very high current (20-40 A) for 10-20 mS will not cause a voltage RISE in the supply, it is more likely to cause a short-duration voltage DROP in the supply (e.g. from 110 V AC to 90 V AC) 

It probably can't. Some of your photos are probably permanently lost. This is why, for the last 65 years, sensible people make multiple independent offline backup copies of important photos and other data. Don't rely on a single cloud provider or other single media, test recovery from backup. Unfortunately, each new generation of people have to learn this lesson themselves the hard way. We have no effective means of teaching children the usefulness of this. 

Note: As far as I know, the Kindle Fire is an Android (forked) Tablet. So presumably it can do things that the "normal" e-ink Kindle's can't. 

You should be able to use the same command to track down what program has grabbed port 80 on your Windows 7 PC. 

It could be an ﬀ ligature such as Unicode Character 'LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF' (U+FB00) It is conceivable that a typed ff is replaced with ﬀ by an autocorrect feature or smart-typography feature. 

When you try to execute a file and bash says it doesn't exist it sometimes means that bash believes the file is a script and that the interpreter specified in the first line (#!) does not exist. If the files is named I would post the output of 

No. One way I can think of is to have one NAT router for each device. Then your computer talks to different IP-addresses, the NAT routers allow the traffic to reach devices with a common IP-address. 

First the shell executes the command on the first line, when that command is finished, it executes the command on the second line. You may want to do something like this (untested) 

I expect the drive will have RAID metadata at the start which prevents it being recognized as a normally formatted non-RAID disk. You may be able to use to gain access to the filesystems. I'd practice with a spare drive. 

The reason for the confusion is 1) sed matches as early as possible (hence 1st example) 2) sed * is as greedy as possible (hence second example) In single-match mode, once it has found a match, sed doesn't look for later matches where it could be greedier. 

No amount of data-transfer is too much. The hardware obviously has a max i/o throughput but there's no need to try to avoid approaching this limit. The disc has a finite lifetime but writing once to a part of it's capacity isn't going to wear it out. Loading any amount of data onto a new freshly formatted hard disk won't cause fragmentation. Fragmentation is caused by intermingled deletes and writes. Some filesystems are less susceptible to fragmentation than others anyway. If you are worried about OSX spotlight trying to index files (for faster searching) whilst loading, you should be able to disable it until loading is finished. 

Yes, they are probably deliberately ignoring Internet standards (RFCs) in order to conserve bandwidth, reduce their costs and increase shareholder profits at the expense of their customers. 

IDE only allows for two controllers (primary and secondary) each with two devices (master and slave). A total of four IDE devices. You may already have a CD-ROM defined that is using one of those possibilities. It may be that libvirt (used by KVM) likes to keep hard disks on the primary controller and thus is limited to two IDE disks. You could play around with the <address> tag or try scsi emulation. 

Configure the program to export to a non-shared folder. Use something like robocopy to watch that folder, copy files to a shared folder with restricted permissions. Give robocopy elevated permissions (e.g. run as administrator). 

Drivers seem to be based on the major chipset not on the board manufacturer. I would expect an "Intel Pro/1000" driver to work on the both Dell-branded and third-party NICs using the Intel Pro/1000 chipset. 

Footnote: I guess you are aware that it isn't safe to install Windows XP on a computer with any kind of network interface that might become connected, even indirectly, to the Internet. 

Yes. You'll need to arrange in DNS that the subdomain's address records point to the appropriate web-server. 

Whenever I've seen a similar problem I have been able to track it down using RegMon or FileMon because the errant process was the only thing active when I was careful not to start any applications. If it is using CPU resources it is likely to be using other resources too. This can help track things down. In my case the culprits were badly written drivers - e.g. a monitor "driver" that checked several times a second to see if the monitor had been rotated into portrait orientation, a HTC synchronisation driver checking twice a second for the presence of a USB link to a phone. The vendor's name showed up in file paths or registry keys, this helped identify the cause. Disabling associated items in the system notification area confirmed the culprit (e.g. right click & choose Exit - activity dies away.) 

"Canonical" means "unique distinguished exemplar". A computer may have many aliases but should only have one canonical name. 

This might be a good candidate for pipelining. Use an FTP client that writes to standard output have the splitting program read from standard input. 

If the platform is Windows, and the printer is not a Postscript or PCL printer, it is likely that any rendering is being done on the PC anyway. You can check the fonts present in a PDF file using Adobe's reader (and probably other readers too) - inspect the document properties. There are products that can replace Fonts in PDF files. Google found "PDFOne" - I have not tried it. 

See "Auditing System Activity" in the Mac OS X Security Configuration" guide You can also do things like 

I don't think there is "a secure way for multiple people to access a selection of servers without them needing to know [a] password." The nearest you can get is to use SSH with public-key authentication and use an SSH authentication agent so that users don't have to enter a password to start a new session at any server. For example: Putty + Pageant. So far as I know, Agent-forwarding is only useful if you have to use SSH-forwarding in the first place.
