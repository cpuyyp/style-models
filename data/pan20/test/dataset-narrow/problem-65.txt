You could attempt to keep the APs and the controller's management interface in the same L2 domain but it would not gain you anything but a headache. The architectural is designed to allow you to plug-and-play APs throughout your network even across L3 boundaries. The APs will discover the controllers through a handful of different ways. We use the DNS discovery. (Add an A record for "CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.yourdomain.com". I believe there is another A record to add, but it escapes me at the moment) I'm not sure that I 100% understand this portion of the question. It sounds like a secretary will set the PSK for the guests. In this case I would for sure recommend you have a different interface that does not allow access to RFC 1918 address space. Use an external DNS server. Then all that is left is to give the secretary access into the WLC to change the SSID's PSK. 

The best way to measure these metrics accurately is with a device dedicated for testing. Exfo, JDSU, and Fluke are several large companies that manufacture devices like this. A PC /can/ test these metrics but you have to make sure there is nothing on the computer skewing the numbers and that the application you're using is accurate. iperf will measure bandwidth throughput but won't measure much else. Ping will measure moment in time latency, but not jitter. Also ICMP echo is only really accurate to 1ms. If you are trying to get an actual latency measurement then you'll need to decide if 1ms of granularity is enough for you/your applications. 

Increase the baud rate for your serial connection. This will allow higher throughput on your serial link. Temporarily set up a /30 link between your laptop and the Cat7600 and use a local tftp server to move the file into the startup config. If the RSP has a MGMT interface on the front you can use this. 

A VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a way of creating multiple virtual switches inside one physical switch. So for instance ports configured to use VLAN 10 act as if they're connected to the exact same switch. Ports in VLAN 20 can not directly talk to ports in VLAN 10. They must be routed between the two (or have a link that bridges the two VLANs). There are a lot of reasons to implement VLANs. Typically the least of these reasons is the size of the network. I'll bullet list a few reasons and then break each one open. 

More than likely you'd have to go with one of the newer overlay networks or using Plexxi's switches. I'm sure you could find some way of doing this through traditional means, but I'm not sure how stable it would be. L3 at TOR is for sure not uncommon. Most larger DCs (Google's, Facebook's) run L3 to the TOR, but they also have phenomenally written applications that don't require VMotion/L2 to recover from failure. It sounds though that your requirements are more SMB and similar pain points for most virtualized DCs. If it's a greenfield deployment I would strongly suggest looking at Plexxi's offering. If not then an overlay might be the right thing for you. 

I originally wan't going to post on here because this question is answered, but after seeing your other post about moving the static routes into your OSPF session I thought this might circumvent that problem. In the ASA you can create a static route for your public address space (Let's say 134.0.15.0/30) and redistribute that route into OSPF. Assuming you have the proper config to establish an OSPF session on the "Outside" interface then it will advertise the static route north. Note: This will also advertise the route to any peers on the "Inside" interface as well. This shouldn't be an issue other than you'll see it in the device's routing tables. 

Depending on which platform your using you can use NetFlow data to see this. Most Cisco routing platforms support this and even newer switching platforms support this as well. Also simply logging the ACL (Adding log to the end of the ACL statement) will generate a log message that states the source of the packets that were denied. 

Because this is a match-any class map you can just add more URLs to match in the class. Note: Matching based on URL will need to be done in the 1921, not the L2/3 switch. 

I've run similar devices to the Soekris with PFSense and M0n0wall. I can push quite a bit of traffic through them with fairly low specs. (On the order of 100Mbps) Wireless controllers gain you two big things. The first is centralized management. You can manage all your APs from one single interface. Need to add an SSID? Easy. Add it to the controller and it gets pushed to the APs. The second thing is centralized ACL enforcement. Typically (though not always) Wireless controllers tunnel the traffic back to itself and have a single egress point into the corporate network. This allows you to apply things like security zones at a single location instead of every place your AP is plugged in. It also allows you to have a single subnet for wireless clients across a larger network. Because of the size of your network I would recommend you look into Ubquiti Networks. They offer you the same gains of having a controller based network but without a controller and at a much lower price point. I've used them successfully in various single building deployments. If you're dead set on using one of your two options here you've selected the correct ones for your size. As far as specs these look almost identical from a brief scan of the tech specs. Perhaps one is to be ceiling mounted the other is a desktop version? The main thing you gain is being able to create different egress points from different VLANs. You can use the router to set up different sub interfaces per VLAN. So for your guest wireless network you could put them on VLAN 50 while the rest of your internal clients are on VLAN 10. You could then apply security policies about what traffic is allowed between the two VLANs. Nope.

A leased line typically refers to a point-to-point style link. A T1 /can/ be a leased line but isn't always. Dedicated lines are a bit harder because that could mean anything. A point-to-point can be dedicated...an Internet connection can be advertised as being dedicated, but that's kind of a farse.Typically a dedicated line just means less oversubscription than a shared or non-dedicated line. Something like 10 or 20 to 1 instead of 100 or 200 to 1. In all honesty these terms do not have a "standard" meaning. So they can be used in a lot of different contexts. 

A poor man's filter can be implemented by using NBAR to match the URL you want to block and then drop the traffic that matches. For instance if you wanted to block google you could use the following 

A tunnel is your only way out here, unfortunately. Without using a tunnel a packet would enter the service providers network and if that destination isn't already known it will get thrown down the black hole. I would hope and assume that the provider isn't doing any special policing on tunneled traffic, but you'll have to test that out for yourself. If you're worried about moving DSCP values between the original packet and the tunnel packet that is easy enough to accomplish. So voice traffic can still pass through the SP network with EF. In all honestly some sort of common peering here would be the best. Even if you peer with RIP, redistribution is easy enough and would accomplish your goals. I'm not sure why you can't apply filtering to incoming routes except perhaps company policy?
