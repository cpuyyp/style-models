You don't have a high enough version of glibc, so you need to update it... In a terminal window, enter: 

Have you checked the system manual? On page 11 it notes how memory must be installed, with 2 DIMMs they must go in slots 1 & 3 from the front of the board. Are both 8GB DIMMs the exact same, meaning same capacity, brand, speed, timings, and chips used? This Gigabyte motherboard does not support configurations of differing pairs of RAM if Dual Channel is enabled in BIOS. Gigabyte only certifies a handful of RAM to their motherboards, but it is hardly all encompassing, but they will rarely give direct support to modules not on their tested list (not that they won't work, but it does explain Gigabytes lack of an answer). Odd though, I usually find appeasing the digital gods by waving an olive branch under the full moon fixes most computer problems... I'm surprised it didn't work for you. 

Although anything is possible, if you don't have any ports mapped via port forwarding, sometimes called virtual server, especially 80, 443, and 8080, or whatever ports your webserver uses... The chances of an attack from outside the LAN getting through your router to that device are near zero. But again, without a more thorough security review, don't take this as the final answer. If there is a will, there is a way no matter what precautions you take. 

I do not know how to do this by directly editing the file, but you can through the GUI... Open TeraTerm, setup all values as you would like them. Font settings are in . Note that even if the size value is not listed, you can enter the value you require manually in the Size field. Once you have all the parameters set, go to and navigate to the installation/startup directory (should be shown by default) and select and then click Any subsequent starting of TeraTerm will use these settings. 

In an HP laptop, the Caps Lock and Scroll Lock keys are used to diagnose hardware failures and startup issues. The number of flashes and on what key is used to diagnose the issue. 

Use a text based browser like links, w3m, or Elinks, or another test based browser... The ones mentioned above are part of the standard Ubuntu repository plus more if you search. 

(Substitute your device from above for /dev/sdaX in the above command) And wait for it to finish. This will eliminate the average person from being able to recover your data. Linux has a much more secure option for deleting information, but it also takes exponentially longer, it is called and it would be executed as this: 

That is entirely dependent on your network setup, if you use DHCP then it is entirely possible, if you statically assign the whole network then no they will not change. I would suggest doing some basic research into IP networking and subnetting, there are tons of resources online, including the one @Hennes mentioned in his comment, or Microsoft's Knowledge Base, Cisco's article on IP Addressing and Subnetting for New Users, or any number of articles that Google can lead you to. 

Assuming this is the same as HP's with similar configurations, and if the proper drivers are loaded, you should have three Switchable Graphics property options in CCC. Navigate to Power - Switchable Graphics Global Settings... Remember that these settings are over-ridden by application specific settings, except in the case of "Force Power Saving Graphics" is set. Here you can set the graphics options to use based on battery or A/C power connection. 

The HP Elitebook 8760w/8770w has 4 physical memory slots, 2 are under the keyboard (Primary Memory Modules), and 2 are accessible from the bottom (Expansion Memory Modules). The system supports up to 32GB of RAM with a maximum 8GB per slot. Disassembly video: Note at 6:09 the memory slots under the keyboard are clearly visible. HP EliteBook 8760w Mobile Workstation Maintenance and Service Guide See document pages 62-64 (PDF pages 70-72). 

In my work laptop I want to run Linux Mint without changing anything in the computer, so I was thinking of just getting a 128GB flash drive to install it on. I know it will work, but what should I consider to lengthen the life of the drive? I have already considered cache, the laptop has 16GB RAM so I should be able to just disable it and if I find a real need for it I could mount a file on the HDD, and probably use ext3 as a filesystem with noatime option. Anything else to consider or is this just a bad idea? Is there a guide for doing this anywhere? 

In Device Manager is the card reader shown? This device uses standard drivers from Microsoft, in Windows 8 and newer manufacturers tend to only publish drivers if they are not available from Windows Update. Check Device Manager to see that the card reader has proper drivers installed, if not or a yellow or red indicator is next to the device, right click the device and select Update Driver and then allow it to search Windows Update for the appropriate driver which should then install itself. Note that an active Internet connection is required when doing this. 

Yes, make your dhcp pool have 0 addresses but leave the static list. Most enterprise equipment and servers allow for this. Standard SOHO routers generally do not let you have no dhcp range when dhcp is enabled, although you can often set the range to 1 IP address and have everything else assigned by static DHCP. The exact process varies by manufacturer and system. 

Assuming your modem is assigned an IP address via DHCP, then you have to either call your ISP and ask them to clear your DHCP lease and reboot, or go to the Basic Settings and look for WAN IP Address and then the Expires field (example) and when you get very close to this time and date, disconnect your modem from the cable or pull the power, then wait until past the DHCP lease expiration time, and reconnect it... the amount of time you have to wait depends entirely on your ISP and how their DHCP is configured. If you reconnect the modem too soon, and the DHCP server hasn't handed out your current address yet, you will likely get the same one back, if it has handed it out (or is configured not to reuse it after the lease is now renewed) then you should be issued a new IP address. How long do you wait? Well, that is the unknown... it could be a few minutes or hours, or it could take days or even weeks depending on multiple factors like how busy your ISP's servers are, DHCP lease time, how many customers they have, how busy the DHCP scope is you are a part of is, and other things that are all outside of your control. 

DHCP is not enabled and you have no Default Gateway defined, thus your PC cannot connect outside of your own subnet and it cannot access the Internet. If you are using a static IP address, you must have IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers defined. In your Win7 machine, according to your ipconfig output, you have no default gateway defined, setting that to 192.168.1.1 should correct the issue and allow connectivity. The alternative if a static IP address is not needed is to change the IPv4 settings to Obtain Automatically for both IP information and DNS information. Once this is complete, open a command window as Administrator and enter and reboot, then try to access the internet again. 

The Windows Phone 7 Connector works with the Zune player. You can sync music and other non-DRM media to and from your Mac. 

Yes. The second connector is for power only, it does not need to be a real USB port. A "standard" USB power supply works in this application, I don't see why using a Samsung Quick Charge unit would be any different. This cable will work find for a 2.5" drive, but is not compatible a 3.5" drive or any SATA device utilizing the 12v power rail. Quick Charge does have multiple voltage levels, although handshaking and agreeing on higher voltages is required between the device and charger, some caution is required when connecting an unsupported device. Fir safety sake, I would recommend picking up an inexpensive generic 1A USB block power source (like the kind you find at convenience store checkouts) instead of the Samsung one, even though from a technical standpoint it should work fine. This should work for a 2.5" SATA drive, which only use the 5v power rail. Most 3.5" SATA drives use both the 5v and 12v power rails. It sounds like you probably need a more universal kit, like this as an example. 

It is a cross-over toggle switch. In the ll position, the connection is straight through, as in a connection to a switch or router. In the X position, the transmit and receive pairs are "crossed" or transposed for connection directly to another PC or uplink port. Without knowing the exact make and model of card I can't be sure, but this likely only effects one port and not all of them, typically the one closest to the switch. (Speculation without knowing more information) In modern network cards/chipsets, the transceiver handles this automatically, in older network cards or chipsets, it had to be done manually, via a toggle switch, special port on the device, or a cross-over patch cord. 

The options are still there, just much more hidden... When I played with it it seemed to give less information though (could have just been me though). I think this is what your are looking for, ignore the first part and scroll down to Enable Verbose Service Startup/Shutdown Messages, the same method works: $URL$ You can also use a program called Ultimate Windows Tweaker $URL$ There is an option under User Accounts called Enable Verbose Logon Messages. 

Your measurements are too vague, they need to be more precise to determine if there is really an issue. You can't adjust the voltages, if there is a problem with the voltages it is a chipset issue and the motherboard in the laptop probably needs to be replaced. USB has very specific voltage ranges: USB 2.0 - 5.0vDC +0.25/-0.60 @ 500ma load USB 3.0 - 5.0vDC +0.25/-0.55 @ 900ma load It is specified that devices configuration and low-power functions must operate down to 4.40 V at the hub port by USB 2.0 and that devices' configuration, low-power, and high-power functions must operate down to 4.00 V at the device port by USB 3.0. More details on USB specifications are available here 

Although your switch is compatible with VLANs, your router is not, and your switch is not capable of doing inter-VLAN routing, so this will not work with your hardware setup. You need a much higher end router, like a mid to high end DD-WRT capable router or an enterprise grade router to handle the 3 unique networks your discussing. The best you can do is have your servers and regular network devices together with the normal wifi network, and use the guest WiFi just for guests (it has no access to any internal devices). Unfortunately, VLANing is not a simple thing to be done with home devices. 

If your module is B&M SATA (most likely), connecting it to a B or M socket should work fine since both types support SATA. Of course, being a bootable device is another story, this depends on your hardware and UEFI. 

Actually, this is quite normal... Although most quality monitors that are "identical" often have a very similar display, that isn't always the case. Manufacturing differences, variance in components, settings, user configuration, default calibration, connection type, etc... there are a host of possibilities. Just because 2 monitors are the same, doesn't mean they display the same, the most common issue is calibration, you may need to set them to look like each other in their menus, not set to the same empirical values. 

As was stated in the comments, this behavior is caused by your DNS server(s) redirecting on a failed resolution, quite common for ISPs to do this actually. Since the recommended action is to change to a DNS server that does not do this, such as Google DNS or OpenDNS, you might want to look into a tool called , which will test the speed and "bad behavior" of hundreds of free DNS servers and recommend the fastest ones for your specific application. Namebench is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and since it's an open source project, ports are available for FreeBSD, Android, iOS, and other operating systems. $URL$ $URL$ 

Most likely you need to replace the webcam module, HP P/N 583219-001, since when you press near the camera it works that is indicative of a bad connection, either in the cable or most likely on the camera module itself. Look at document page 28 (PDF page 35), Display Components, of the Service Manual for this laptop. This document also clearly shows the process for disassembly and replacement of the module. There is a chance that you could disassemble the display and find the camera module is out of position somehow and you can readjust it, but I personally think that is unlikely. This is clearly not a driver/software issue. 

I don't know if there is any documentation to support this, but I would say for the 5-10 minutes breaks, just lock the screen and leave it on especially if on A/C power. If you are on battery, it could be beneficial to close the lid and let it go to sleep although the savings would be minimal, and I don't think it would make a significant difference to the long-term health of your laptop. For the overnights, or any long term duration, I would recommending turning it off completely and not using hibernation, especially if your laptop contains an SSD in which hibernation will very significant effect on the longevity of your solid state drive. Be aware that many Linux distributions have completely done away with "Hibernation" and it is generally recommended to disable it, if it is still enabled. Returning to active use from Hibernation is often the same amount of time as a full boot-up, so there is no real benefit to hibernation. Hibernation also tends to make us lazy, because your computer will supposedly start up and be in the exact same state as when it was shut off, with the same open programs, documents, etc. which tends to make people forget to properly close files. If the hibernation file does not load correctly or becomes corrupt, the boot basically becomes a standard boot and all of those files (and potential changes or saves) are lost. There are many good articles online regarding this, and just as many opinions. Best to research it make your own opinion on the subject. Here is a good place to start. 

It is a standard USB 3.0 Micro-B connector. $URL$ Also, in some devices these ports on devices are also backwards compatible with USB 2.0 Micro-USB cable if they have low enough power requirements or external power. 

A SIP trunk is only required to connect to the PSTN, it is not required for the SIP clients to communicate with each other. Your real issue would most likely be routing SIP through your firewall, most SIP servers require a Session Border Controller of some kind if the server sits behind a firewall or router, especially if NAT is involved. Assuming you can get over that hurdle, communication between the SIP clients should be simple. 

The highest version Windows Mobile 2003 (Dell ROM version A05), and that is about it... This device was never big with developers like the x50/51 series, so there are no aftermarket ROMs I am aware of. 

Assuming this is not a corporate network environment (that would off topic), the most likely case since your ISP is handing you an address in private IP space (172.31.x.x) is it has multiple public IPs that are both 200.x.x.x and 181.x.x.x and it using some kind of load balancing algorithm/device, causing some connections to the outside world to take path (200.x.x.x IP address) and other times or destinations it takes a different path (181.x.x.x IP address) and it seen as those corresponding addresses on the far end. This is not uncommon and often cannot be replicated since even connections to the same host may cause a different public IP address to be seen due to the variable nature load balancing can do since it could be based on traffic, time of day, destination, distribution of traffic and other details. If you are concerned, I would contact your ISP and ask them if this is normal.
