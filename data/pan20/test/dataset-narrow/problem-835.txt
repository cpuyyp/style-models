If you have admin access to the ASDM it's dead easy. Your best bet is to read the Cisco docs here first as you will want to understand what you are doing before you touch it - messing this up could break all comms through that firewall! Also, going one level further up - check you really want to allow file and printer sharing between these two network segments - from a security perspective, the firewall is doing what it is supposed to at the moment, blocking risks - so you will be raising the level of risk (probably only incrementally, but check) More generally - if there is an IT team or IT Security team, make the request to open 445 on that firewall between the 4 servers, giving reasons, and let them deal with it - as I mentioned: you could cause major problems if you have not configured a firewall before! 

I have never seen any company use public IPs for their desktops or internal servers, and these days it is also very rare for externally facing servers (eg webservers) to have a public IP address - usually these are NATed behind load balancers, or ever more commonly, are virtual servers in a dynamic server pool, so don't even really exist. The NAT'ing may not be down to the level of all internal IP's to one external, usually there are ranges, however it is the overwhelming norm for NAT'ing to be used in one form or another. 

I've read everything I can find online, but I cannot find a simple answer to this question. I have Windows Server 2012 Standard installed using a volume license product key. The official product name is Windows Srv 2012 Standard MAK B in the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center. Can I use Hyper-V on that server to create a new virtual server running Windows Server 2012 Standard and use the same exact volume license product key to activate it? Simply put, can the physical server and the virtual server use the exact same product key? My intuition says that it won't work for some reason, but I haven't found anything written in plain English that proves it won't. I hope I'm wrong, and it would work! 

I have an existing SMTP server on our network that is used to send emails from a variety of printers, applications, etc... I have installed the IIS SMTP Server on a new Windows Server 2012 R2 server to replace the current SMTP server in use. To set it up, I copied the settings from the existing SMTP server almost exactly, except for the change in internal IP address. We have an SPF record so that we can send emails without the use of a smarthost or routing through our mail provider. We have had no problems with it. To avoid updating our SPF record, we set up our Sonicwall rules to route both SMTP servers' outgoing email to appear to be from the same external address, smtp.domain.com. This what our NAT rules look like: Internal (smtp.domain.com) 192.168.1.2 -> 68.68.68.68 (smtp.domain.com) Internal (primarysmtp.domain.com) 192.168.1.3 -> 68.68.68.68 (smtp.domain.com) We changed a printer to use the new SMTP server (primarysmtp.domain.com) for testing. The emails are received by the SMTP server and put in the Queue folder, which is good. Now, we cannot get these emails to send. I downloaded the SMTPDIAG tool for testing. At first I thought it was a DNS issue, but that checks out on the test. It will not connect to the target email provider. 

Exchange servers were designed to be constrained endpoints. The session configuration is a bare bones configuration schema with limited exposed methods. As Exchange servers are exposed to the outside world the designers are obsessed with security. The command you're trying to use is trivial in your existing context as you specified the environment you wanted with your instantiation. It is strongly recommended that you work within the existing session configuration (for remote) or run code locally for access to all methods. However, if your risk tolerance affords it you can create a custom session configuration schema using information you find here. 

The creators of Powershell at Microsoft wanted to create a single new product that would replace the cmd shell and vbscript. One of the primary goals of Powershell was to standardize cmdlet naming, call site proceedure, switch naming, and output (as an object). Anecdotally, another primary focus was eliminating the security flaws of vbscript. By default Powershell cmdlets are Overloaded so that the same example function can be called like so: 

Starting after 2008 R2 Microsoft changed "Services and Applications" to "Roles". Also in the referenced example, "Under Actions (on the right), click Move this service or application to another node" is now "Under Actions, click move, then either best possible node or select node". 

We have all of the DNS records set up for our e-mail servers and smtp outbound relay. Our MX record actually points back to our Barracuda Spam/Virus Filter in front of our Exchange server. The IP address that the message is referring to is the IP address assigned to our WAN on our Firewall/Nat device. Our default gateway address in this example would then be 1.1.1.1 What do I have to set up so that these messages are delivered? Do I set up a fake MX record pointing to the default gateway? Add another A & PTR record pointing to the WAN IP address? Is there something in our internal configuration that could be incorrect? No records are set up for the gateway address now, just the assigned IP addresses for each of the outbound services. All servers are Windows based. Primary e-mail server is Exchange 2007. 

It ended up being a DNS issue. The new server had a total of 5 IP addresses assigned to it. Even though we specified the IP address for the SMTP server to use, when the connection was being made it would resolve back using the computer name and a different IP address than the one we specified. We added outbound SMTP rules on the firewall for all of the IP addresses on the server and it is working now. 

It is a control that could have been added by the admins on that server - concurrent logins (except where this expected) are a simple flag to alert of possible malicious behaviour. However, it is not something we see that often, and very rarely at system level - this is usually an application based control - so I would be more inclined to think that somewhere along the line something has just got broken, whether this is a password expiry, account disabling for some other reason, incorrect keypairs being used, or even configuration settings being set up incorrectly when your friend did that. There are a lot of good reasons to avoid sharing accounts, and not just for the sysadmins - you might need to go through the history file on your friend's machine to see exactly what happened at his end. 

From carrying out a fair amount of penetration testing on virtual environments I would add these two items to watch: Plan your virtual environment exactly as you would a real environment - as any structural or architectural vulnerabilities you introduce in the real world will translate well into the virtual world. Get your virtual configuration right - 99% of all successful penetration I have managed into VM's or LPAR's has been through misconfiguration or reuse of credentials. And on a less technical note, also think about segregation of duties. What may have been handled by network teams, server teams etc. may now be one team. Your auditor may find this important! 

Thinking about installing it on our Windows Server 2003 Terminal Server, but I cannot find any documentation if it work correctly in that environment. I'd want it to be the default renderer for all of our users within IE8. Thanks! 

We thought it was the windows advanced firewall, but it is turned completely off on the server. Then we thought it was our Sonicwall rules, but they are almost exactly the same as the existing one we use. We cannot find any place that is blocking port 25. The new NAT rule also has ZERO traffic statistics, so it doesn't look like anything is even getting off of the new server to use the NAT rule. We have tried IISRESET and stopping and starting the SMTP server multiple times. The test always fails with the error 10061. My Google fu has gotten me nowhere. Is it possible that Windows Server 2012 R2 could still be blocking outgoing traffic on port 25, even though the firewall is turned off? What are we missing? 

If you are trying to deny access to your website to anyone but your VPN users, you could lock down your entire network from the outside world and only allow the VPN connection. Once your users connect to the VPN, they could access any internal websites you have running by either accessing them by IP address or url and validate their referring IP address either in code or by way of IIS to allow or disallow further access. 

If you select any given ticket and run a on it you can view the list of properties. None of which are mapping back to the Affected User. Thinking perhaps the ticket data is saved with the user object, I ran the following code: 

So what happened? Powershell interpreted our input as a single array containing two strings which were passed to the first (positionally) variable. To get the desired result using parenthesis you'd have to do this: 

DHCP Server Not Offering to PXE Client BACKGROUND: I'm in the process of adding PXE services to an existing SCCM 2007 server. The SCCM server is separate from the DHCP server (Server 2008 x86) and did not have PXE services or WDS installed. I added PXE services in the Config Manager before adding WDS as a role. Because DHCP is on a separate server, I did not make any changes to DHCP Options (there is not a current 60, 66, or 67 configured). The WDS is configured with both a boot image (ripped from the Win7 install dvd and an install image which was created by someone else). SCCM has a TS configured and advertised to the Unknown Computers collection. The DHCP server is configured for both DHCP and BOOTP requests (I added BOOTP as part of my troubleshooting, the default lease time is set to 5 minutes). It also has NAP enabled for the IPV4 addresses but disabled for this SCOPE. My host, the VM, the DHCP server, and the SCCM/WDS server are all on the same subnet. Juniper routers move the packets. I'm testing PXE using a VirtualBox machine configured to network boot and it has an empty dynamically allocated disk attached. Wireshark is installed on both my host computer (running VirtualBox) and the DHCP server. PROBLEM: When the VM starts it performs a network PXE boot. I can see the discover request by the VM in Wireshark on both my host and the DHCP server. However, the DHCP server is not responding with an IP offer. If I could get some guidance as to where else to look for an error, or possibilities as to why it's not working, I'd appreciate it. EDIT: The dhcpsrvlog does not record an event regarding the request for an IP from the pxe client.

As the question states, what are the drawbacks of making every capable Windows 2003 or 2008 Server in my organization a domain controller for the domain? Is it just overkill? Will many 3rd party applications explode? Something else I'm not thinking of? Are there any advantages? 

Can anyone suggest an alternative to the Windows Remote Desktop Client for Windows 2000 Professional that will allow for a screen resolution larger than the fixed 1600 x 1200? I am trying to get to 1920x1080. The target server is Windows Server 2003. Thanks! 

Does anyone know of any corporate anti-virus solutions available for a Windows environment that is not license based? Everything I have ever seen is either client or user license based, plus the management software. I'm thinking along the lines of Barracuda Networks business model for their products, where you buy the product based on needed resources and not user or client count. Just wondering if this business model in the antivirus world even exists. If so, are they good products? Thanks. 

I was able to successfully load Windows Server 2008 on an HP DL380 G2, which is not officially supported by HP. It seems to be working perfectly fine, except for the fact I cannot locate any network drivers that will work so I really cannot do anything with the server yet. The server includes 2 HP NC3163 Fast Ethernet NIC's. I've searched high and low for anything that could potentially make these NIC's work with Windows Server 2008, but haven't had any luck yet. Should I quit my search and get a cheap gigabit card to put in one of the open PCI slots or is there some mysterious network driver resource I cannot locate? 

I can see one major flaw with this - all an attacker has to do is hijack one communication and the app will then only talk to their computer. Realistically, it wouldn't be too hard to watch the traffic to see what would be required. Of course you could use encryption using a public/private key pair to avoid this issue, then you are authenticating - which seems like a much better idea. 

Publishing configurations can help an attacker a little - in that it reduces the time they would usually spend in scanning/information gathering, but if you are a target then they would be carrying out these tasks anyway. Having directory or server names that indicate their function also speeds up an attack (eg FinanceServer01) so you are better off having a naming convention which doesn't give away free info like this. Realistically, if it makes your life easier to publish the config, then do so, but remove unnecessary info (passwords, certs, keys, hostnames) - focus your security efforts instead on making sure your patches are current, your config secures you against attack, and you monitor your most sensitive data (if appropriate) for intrusion. 

Under most VM platforms you can do something very close to what you describe. Have Win XP, Linux and Win7 as VMs. Treat the Win7 VM as a normal PC. Log in and out of it as you like and have it maximised on your screen. Not exactly what you have asked for, but it will look exactly like what you want. I have used VMWare and VirtualBox like this and the docs imply the others will work similarly. Same as all platforms you want to run multiple VMs on, go for large memory and fast CPU, more is better here. 

uses PoSh's job system behind the scenes to perform its function. All of your script's code is completing before the job completes. This is why you're seeing your completion message in an unexpected location. To fix this you need to assign a variable to your call and remove your pipe to . This will give you a handle to the job that's running in the background. You then need to monitor the progress of your job with a loop. Something to the effect of: 

I feel like I should be able to cast as an in the param block and preset it with data, and return as the same datatype, but I couldn't figure it out. If anyone does, or finds documentation why it won't work, please answer. 

Which of course returns the cluster object. So, what's going on here? What's different with ? Edit Version info from Powershell: 

Double check and ensure you're running powershell as an administrator. This problem can occur if your instance isn't elevated as some password policies (GPO) are likely hidden. 

You asked for the entire class to be instantiated. Looking at the class enumerator on msdn I'm not surprised it failed needing administrator access. You could try querying the specific properties you need and see if you trigger an exception, but most will require admin access. Here's the msdn page for the class you're using: $URL$ 

The Net Use command will only show me what drives that only I have mapped when I am logged into the server. What is the easiest way to see all mapped drives for all users and the status of the drives? Thanks. EDIT I'm specifically looking for all disconnected drives for all users that are not longer valid so I can disconnect them. I believe the old disconnected mapped drives are causing problems regarding Outlook and inserting attachments to emails. EDIT AGAIN (WHY NOT?) My original thought was that someone, somewhere created a tool that displayed this information, and that I was just unable to find it. 

Right now, I have Adobe Reader 9.0.0 installed on my Win 2003 Terminal Server. Before I just go ahead and update it to version 9.4, does anyone have an experience with a better PDF Reader for a terminal server environment? It does not perform poorly now, but I am worried that the update might cause some unwanted slowdown in performance. Can anyone recommend a better alternative for a terminal server environment than Adobe PDF Reader? Any gotchas when installing in a TS environment? My googling hasn't really answered my questions completely and Adobe didn't seem to have any information pertaining to this situation available (unless I just missed it). Thanks.
