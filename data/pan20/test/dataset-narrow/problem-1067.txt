They have different instructions that get done at different times. maybe because one instruction involves more logic gates than another. Different processors may perform different types of operations faster than others. But there are benchmarks which I suppose test how the processor is at a bunch of things calculate a figure that represents how it does, a kind of average. PassMark seems to be one such measure. $URL$ It's not absolute in that there could be different ways of testing it. But it's absolute in the sense that it measures the speed in a way that isn't relative to the processor. So, not like Hz. 

which computer or interface is 192.168.2.1? I guess an interface on your MAC? Does your win xp machine gave internet access? I wonder if there's some issue from your xp machine being on a different subnet to the other two. I think that router-modem device won't support different subnets. What you could do is change every device's subnet mask to 255.255.0.0 or put the XP machine on 192.168.1 with 255.255.255.0 so, all are on the same subnet. Once they are all on the same subnet, then make sure the OS software firewall is letting VNC in e.g. port 5900, and that it is allowing ping(ICMP requests and responses) and you could allow all ICMP. Here are two pics for enabling ICMP on the XP Firewall $URL$ $URL$ 

Well, you haven't captured anything to store to be referenced by the \1 and \2 and \3 that's why you appear to lose things when you try to refer to them in the replace. Use round brackets(parentheses) in the find section around what you want to keep for \1 and \2 and \3 like this It's not quite clear what you want to do, but here's an example And you wouldn't want just \r in the replace.. i've included that error of yours in the example and it somehow made a new line. But you should be doing either \n(a unix line ending) or \r\n(a windows line ending) to make that new line/line separator/line terminator. 

You can repair it on your computer then move it to another computer. You obviously know how to do a repair installation. $URL$ Here are some links about moving it(after it fixed on your computer), to his computer. $URL$ And many links on replacing the HAL $URL$ Acronis also lets you make an image of XP that can be put on another computer. 

Well, since you asked about other suggestions. (presumably besides his one of changing the hdd to ssd), and I can include pictures of the other suggestions here. You can get things like this. laptop fan coolers. laptop cooling pads. 

Well, you have to start an ssh server on 192.168.122.1 And you have to SSH to that machine `ssh 192.168.122.1' And then, once you have that sorted out. You go to the ssh client machine and do And then you start VNC client on the machine with the SSH client, and you connect VNC to 127.0.0.1:5901 (that 5901 is determined by the first 5901 in the command) The connection will then go through / tunnel through, the SSH connection When it reaches the SSH server, It will then get forwawrded to 127.0.0.1:5901 So it will remain on the server, and get sent to port 5901 on the server. 

I'm posting this as an answer as it's a bit long for a comment. There are two different issues. Two different questions. 1)compiling it 2)running it in eclipse. For compiling it, state the error. Compile it from the command prompt. If you can't do that then you should not be using a GUI. For running it in Eclipse, state the method you are using, and the error. Try giving JD-GUI a class file rather than a jar file. The site for JD-GUI says $URL$ JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source codes of “.class” files. I'd think you'd want to unjar the jar file, i.e. decompress it Then when you have class files, if you want source code, try JD-GUI. It's very bad that you haven't stated the method you used and the errors you got. And that you haven't broken down the problem into its constituent parts 

Note, below shows how you can type it in word or wordpad, but it turned out the questioner wanted it in notepad and was getting an apostrophe. Nevertheless, here's how to get it in word or notepad.. good question.. you're talking about logical OR $URL$ you can see logical OR and logical AND in charmap if you choose the font that has them , so arial ms unicode. You can copy/paste it into ms word.. you can put your cursor after it and do alt-x and see its code. e.g. 2227. That's hex though. You can convert that into decimal with calc. It shows the code is 8743 you can type that with alt, that's AND. Logical AND. (looks like a pointy n) ∧ is 8743 Logical OR, The ∨ (which is technically not a V or v, it's a ∨), is 8744. 

I notice that Character Map goes up to FFFF nothing beyond. It doesn't go as far as 1F381 $URL$ Unicode Character 'WRAPPED PRESENT' (U+1F381) But if I look up 1F381 in babelmap, it shows that Segoe UI Symbol has it 

As fixer suggested, wrapping was what was happening.. One may be aware that when you draw or insert something in ms word, you can get text to go alongside it, and you can also prevent it.. There's an option if you right click a table to get text to go around it. That doesn't just affect text, that affects e.g. another table. The key is the text wrapping option in table properties In the table on the left the wrapping /so-called "text wrapping", was set to being around. 

And we see there we have a lot of chunks of 1 row so nothing to sort. We have one chunk of two rows and they are not ordered by col c yet, so they'll get reordered. So 

Funnily enough I looked into this question when I had the problem, and discovered that Windows's internal client is hard to beat for that feature. e.g. open "My Computer" and FTP to the URL. This was the solution somebody mentioned to a guy that asked it, and it worked for them and for me. Despite what you might ridiculously think, despite what you say, you're always going to need to download the files or you're not going to be able to view them. Windows's internal FTP facility uses notepad. I doubt you even found it to be slow at saving. 

You can't do it natively. Maybe FF has an extension.. But i'd guess Privoxy can do it. It's a web proxy, you typically run it locally, and it can rewrite webpages, and apparently also requests too. $URL$ $URL$ Typical use: Redirect requests to other sites. Effect: Convinces the browser that the requested document has been moved to another location and the browser should get it from there. (privoxy can be a bit fiddly though, and slow browsing down sometimes, and I can't test it at the moment) 

I can open "My Computer"..tools..map network drive. Check "Reconnect at logon". And it is permanent. But I may want to clear the shares, and create them quickly. So I want to automatically do a few, so I want a fast way of doing it. I suppose I could write a batch and have it load with the command prompt. Lines like 

I usually use mouses with wires, but a friend has a wireless mouse, happens to be a Microsoft mobile mouse 2000 but no doubt many are like this. I'm not sure what it connects to though. I am not looking at it at the moment. I imagine it connects to some base, and then the base connects via USB, though the only base I saw was made by Belkin and was a 4 port hub, with a red light so it may have communicated with the mouse but I doubt it. There's the mouse and there's the computer, there's a usb base. I can't see exactly what the mouse is transmitting to. 

And I have restarted. But it doesn't work I still get that message that I "do not have sufficient privilege" 

ah, like a path command for data files / like having other directories treated as current directory. don't know.. I often use pushd. then I can change back to the previous directory with popd. Or you could use doskey macros then do to go from one directory to another. Or a batch file to change dir. Funnily enough, there is the append command , an ancient DOS command, but I don't think it works in NT, at least not in XP.
