First, I am going to assume that you are on a home network and that your router hands out DHCP (automatic) IP addresses. If not, you MUST contact your network administrator, or you will cause problems if you introduce a duplicate IP address on the network. Second, this seems like an easy question, but there are a few things you need to do in order to really make sure you are doing it right. In practice, even if you don't, in a home network, you probably won't experience problems since the odds of a duplicate IP are low, but it is still very possible, so it is easier to do it right. I realize the following seems a bit long, but it is fairly easy to follow, however, if you have questions, please post back and I will answer them. Next, you should try to figure out what IP addresses your DHCP server is handing out so you pick an IP that it will not give to another computer later. The best way is to go into your router as this is probably where you are getting your DHCP IP address from. Usually it is somewhere in its LAN settings, or near them (check your manual, or ask a separate question here with your router model listed), you can find the range it is handing out. Often it is x.x.x.100-x.x.x.254. If that is not easy for you, or you don't know the router's password, we can make an educated guess: You can open a command box, and do an . That will give you your IP address and default gateway (usually your router). Also take note of your DNS servers, as you will also need to enter them below. Pick an IP address that is not your router's address, and add 20. So if your router is 192.168.1.1, then pick 192.168.1.20. The subnet mask for a home network is almost always 255.255.255.0 (it is the same as your IPCONFIG/ALL), and the gateway you enter when you set the static will be the same as in the IPCONFIG/ALL. The only caveat is that if your IP address when you did the IPCONFIG/ALL is very low, like 192.168.1.2 or near that (we are only really looking at the last number), then the DHCP range being given out is low, so pick something like 192.168.1.250. Whatever IP you pick, open a command box, and do PING 192.168.1.20 (or whatever IP you pick to be your static). So now that you have how to figure out what IP to use, here is how to implement it. Go to and right-click your Wireless Network connection. Double-click , and enter your settings as in the sample screenshot based on what you came up with in the first part of the question. I added 8.8.8.8 as another DNS server, which you can use if your IPCONFIG showed only the router, otherwise, if you had two DNS servers listed, use them. 

The junction link didn't work either. My heart tells me it must be a permissions issue. Can anybody help? EDIT: I tried changing the permissions on the folder to make the owner of the folder in Google Drive to "SYSTEM", but it didn't fix it. 

Turns out it is 64 - found this out by deleting the value, restarting the dock, clicking on the resizing area but not dragging it, letting go, and then checking the value. 

I've been playing around with docking, and have noticed I can grab the desktop and drag it to the left or right of the screen. Doing so does not just make the desktop smaller, it turns it into a list of icons of what is open on the desktop. When you click one of these icons, it undoes the docking and take you to full screen desktop. What's the purpose of this? Can anyone provide a real life use case for this behavior? 

Is there a link I can put in my dock that will minimize every window and just show the desktop? Or, can this be accomplished with a keyboard shortcut? 

No, the latter: If you had version 5, you had to download version 6 separately. At least in the past, it only updated maintenance releases. It is hard to say if version 6 will actually update to version 7 though since it has not happened yet. 

I would try making a new shortcut, and seeing if that fixes it. The location of the current default shortcut in the Start Menu is here: 

In other words, the reason it failed is that "PPP adapter" is not part of the name, and the GUID is just a name Windows gave that adapter in the registry. 

If you are running it while you are working, it probably is not worth it. Everyone has their own opinion on this, but you can probably do this only every three months (or even longer) and be more than fine. Just do it when you are going to be away from the computer. 

I would not do it that way at all. I don't know if you will be able to play your games, but there is the possibility you won't be able to. It is also likely that some drivers will not exist. I would install either Virtual Box, or get VMWare workstation. Virtual Box is free, but VMWare workstation is a paid product. I would run Server 2008 as a virtual machine within your workstation. This will also give you much more flexibility as you study other products as you will not have to change your OS, you will just create a new VM. You can also run more than one VM at a time, so you can create more complex scenarios, like a domain with multiple servers and workstations (if you have enough CPU power and RAM on your laptop). $URL$ 

Just built a new machine with an ASUS Maximus VI Hero motherboard which happens to have a newer Intel ethernet controller, model Intel I217-V. I'd like to use the Debian netinstall (debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso) and somehow get the new driver ($URL$ loaded during the installation process. I'm not really sure how to do this... do I need to bust out the shell during the install and make and install the driver? 

Is it possible for me to just copy a codec file into a directory without having to install some janky codec pack filled with all kinds of nonsense? I just want to be able to play MKV files without running some type of installation executable. 

Just installed Windows 8, pinned Notepad to the start screen. When I press the Windows key and use the Notepad tile to run Notepad, it will focus on the currently open Notepad window. I'd like it to start a new instance of Notepad. Is this possible? 

This customization would be nice. Is this possible out of the box, and if not, could a developer modify the start screen to make it possible? 

ping 127.0.0.1 (the localhost) ping 192.168.1.100 (the first two tell if it can talk to itself) ping 192.168.1.200 (can talk to other hosts internally) ping 192.168.1.1 (can it talk to other hosts internally, especially the one that will forward to the Internet) Ping 8.8.8.8 or any other external IP address (proves you can get to the Internet) ping www.google.com (tests DNS resolution. If it fails, you can test www.cisco.com to be sure it is not the host. If you get this far, and you still cannot use your browser or other application, you know it is application-related, not your TCP/IP, and there is no reason to tamper with the TCP/IP settings) 

I had never though about this before, but as far as I can tell, Task Manager only reports on physical memory. I suggest that you just look at the root of the drive you put the virtual memory files (pagefile.sys) on, and make sure they total the 8000MB you set. If they are there, you are fine. 

Check to make sure that you are using a 32-bit OS, and if so, download it again. It sounds like it may be corrupt or the wrong version. Lastly, it could be a corrupt file in this directory: Windows\Installer folder. Delete any files with an .msi extension (You may need to enable viewing the extensions). 

I keep accidentally hitting the "Pin to Start" option when I go to empty the Recycle Bin. Is there some registry key I can use to just remove that specific option from the context menu? 

I have hosted Exchange right now, with one mailbox containing around 3GB. I'm looking at switching over to Office 365. Can I just change where my Exchange server lives, and all of my stuff will start syncing to the new server? Or do I need to export my stuff, delete the current Exchange server out of Outlook, add the new one, and then import? 

By default, a fresh install of Google Chrome will place an entry on the Start Screen that when clicked will open the Modern UI/Metro version of Chrome. This is frustrating, as I want to have it open in my desktop. Is there any way to fix this? 

After you close regedit, when you go to open Chrome from the start screen it will open in your desktop. 

You can now run your modified BootCamp64.msi on Windows 8 and everything will install as expected. After rebooting, you can use the Boot Camp Control Panel in the task bar to modify your keyboard and trackpad settings. Windows 8 runs like a dream on my MacBook Air! Here's a pic: 

If there is a limit, it is over 26, and you are not even close to it. You have another issue. See if you can get more info, and post back exactly what you mean by "the option to map the folder just disapeared", and where is did that. A screenshot would be helpful. For more on going over 26 lettered drives: $URL$ 

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a method of automatically handing out, and recovering unused, IP addresses (and other settings as techie007 said) rather than having to set them statically. Setting them statically becomes a nightmare to keep track of them on a large network, so this was developed to ease that management burden. DHCP gets you an IP address (subnet mask, and default gateway at least), which is VERY specific to your local network, and therefore has to be exactly correct, and UNIQUE to your network. This IP address allows you to connect to other systems, both locally, and to the Internet. DNS is for name resolution, meaning, the conversion of www.microsoft.com (for example) into an IP address that your system can connect to. There are hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of DNS servers out there that can give you that information. Most people use the one their ISP's have given them, but you could technically get converted IP address information from just about ANY DNS server out there, so you can pick it at will, unlike the very specific IP address given to you by DHCP. In fact, many people use Google's public DNS servers: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 since they are very robust. Unlike your IP address, which is only for your ONE computer, any number of people can access the same DNS server. One last caveat: For anyone reading this, if you are on a Microsoft domain, or other corporate environment, you do not want to override these settings. Your computer needs the internal DNS server to resolve hosts on your internal network.
