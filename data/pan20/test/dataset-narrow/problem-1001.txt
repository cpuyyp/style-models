For years, I've had the exact same issues with app thumbnails. Particularly for Metro-style apps (RT/UWP), I often see a blank or default icon, primarily in search results and settings. I've been troubleshooting it for years, with no success until now. I'm documenting this here because I know I'm going to encounter it again. When I search for a solution, I'll hopefully find this page. Background In Windows 10, UWP apps are shipped as AppX packages. This includes many of the new built-in apps (stored in ) as well as apps downloaded via Windows Store (stored in ). PowerShell offers several cmdlets that are useful for managing AppX packages. Throughout my troubleshooting, I found Get-AppxPackage, Add-AppxPackage, and Remove-AppxPackage particularly useful, especially since is inaccessible to normal users, even administrators. Before attempting these fixes, you should be comfortable editing the registry, working with the command prompt and PowerShell, and making backups. You should be prepared to wipe everything and reinstall Windows should something go wrong. Issue 1: Third-party thumbnail handlers for .png Some third-party apps like to install custom thumbnail generators. Some of these apps do so in a way that breaks things. In my case, Google's Drive File Stream was the culprit. Keep in mind that this is different from having a default program for a file; Windows Photos remained the default for me. To solve the issue: 

Close all open File Explorer windows and re-open one. Navigate to "This PC" and you should see everything in order again. 

The only tool I've ever been able to get a Windows USB stick working with is Microsoft's own USB stick tool, downloadable here: $URL$ This is Windows-only, though, so you might have to use VirtualBox or something to get it working. 

These odious actions can be blocked on Chrome with the "Kill Evil" extension: $URL$ (EDIT) This extension appears to cause weird issues on facebook, be sure to whitelist it. 

You might want to download Samsung Kies to ensure the right drivers are installed. www.samsung.com/kies -- I think Kies3 is only for more recent phones, but it'll tell you what to do. Alternatively, consider AirDroid - www.airdroid.com - it's an Android app that lets you transfer files (and LOTS besides) through your web browser, no wires/drivers required. 

Edit the details for the key "ProviderOrder" to place the string "CbFs3," at the beginning of it. BROKEN AFTER WINDOWS 10 1511 UPDATE: 

This raises a new problem, though. If the user does this, how do they ensure Windows 10 will not constantly nag them with an advisory to "Restore Internet Explorer Security settings"? Even when dismissed it will flash up regularly, not just on boot but during regular intervals. (I don't have a screenshot for the advisory.) 

Run: Navigate to: Look for a key with at least one subkey. If you see any subkeys, you've probably found the culprit. Delete the subkeys. Restart File Explorer. 

Issue 5: Windows Setings Sync I've heard that Windows Settings Sync has caused issues with icons for some people. I haven't been able to reproduce this, but you can check whether it's the issue by disabling it temporarily. It's likely that there's either some underlying setting that's the true culprit; it may be resulting in bad icons being uploaded. Reportedly, this primarily affects search results in Cortana and the Start menu. 

Right-click on the Start Menu icon or press Windows + X. A menu will appear. Click . Under the pane on the right, click the link. Click the link in the pane on the left. The tab should already be selected in the resulting dialog. Click in the group. Ensure is checked. 

Run Disk Cleanup. (You can search for it in the Start menu.) Check . Uncheck everything else. If this works, you can stop. Click . Open the command prompt. Attempt an automated icon cache clear: (prior to Windows 10: ). If this works, you can stop. Kill : Delete a cache: Delete more caches: If thumbnails were also problematic, delete those caches, too:: Start File Explorer back up: 

For people like me coming from Google: Yes, it is possible to do this with Windows, without any third-party tools. Tested with Windows 10 Pro x64. I used this procedure to move both the EFI System Partition and the System Reserved partition. It should work on Windows 8 as well. If your primary drive lacks space, first you'll need to shrink your C: partition (or equivalent). I'm using 260 MB in this example as that's what newer drives require, but older drives with smaller sectors only require 100 MB. If you don't need to make space, take note of the comments that indicate which steps you should skip. While you're at it, you probably want to move your System Reserved partition. These are typically 1000 MB and store useful Windows metadata. You may find that some Windows features don't work without a System Reserved partition. I've included the steps for creating such a partition on your primary drive and marked those steps with comments. It should be easy to exclude those steps if you'd rather skip them, but you'll need to alter the numbers when shrinking (e.g., 260 MB instead of 1260 MB). Comments are prefixed with (for "remark"), as these are supported both by cmd.exe and diskpart.exe. From cmd.exe running as an administrator: 

If I mount a time capsule disk (or another AFP, SMB network resource) and look on it with it appears as , so rsync can't access it (even with sudo). How to mount a network resource different than (e.g. )? I'm on OSX (but I would like to know how to reach it generally on unix systems) 

I'm trying to ping a VM from KVM Host over the bridge (maybe this informations is redundant). And there is no response to the ping, not even or What does it mean? Update: 

I did , , mount of , but when I try to run or it simply doesn't find any command. I see many tutorials, but they assume I have passwd and chroot. But I have not? Where are they? I have the $PATH normally configured. 

The GW is a.b.c.133 (which is in the /27 network with its gateway a.b.c.129) I statically added an arp route: 

But as I saw the didn't expanded if looking with . I thought the reboot will solve the problem. Then I tried to mount the home partition back: 

it doesn't tell an error, but growlnotify's message is empty, so didn't work. but if I execute from bash manually it works a s planned. 

If you give somebody your USB drive to put files on it, it is so annoying to clean up afterwards, all these useless for other than OSX platforms artifacts, which pollute the disk. Is it any solution to prevent this behavior. Maybe to write those files on your own and set them as read only something like "6/700" permissions? P.S. I'm not asking what to do on OSX by others, since I don't know who will put me a new file next time (I can't explain this problem and any configurations to all other people), but rather what to do from the USB drive point of view.
