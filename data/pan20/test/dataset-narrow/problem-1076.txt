If you are speaking about folders and , then do not try to delete them. Those are special folders meaning "current folder" and "parent folder" and should not be counted as members of a folder itself. You can try those commands to understand it better: 

Only one program uses the USB link. It can arbitrate communications with a device even when several clients want to use it (concurrent shell and push for example). Accessing USB link might require specific privileges. You can start server as root for the server to successfully connect the USB link still running the client without elevated privileges. You can even think about accessing a device remotely by connecting the server from another computer on your local network. 

The fact that shell children dies when the shell itself dies is something specific. I see two reasons for that: 

ClamAV daemon auto-start Auto-start of daemon is fired by script from package . This gives you two options to disable automatic startup of this daemon: 

The parent process (already living) s itself, leading in two execution flows from that point. One living in the parent process and one living in a fresh new process. The new (child) process mutes itself to execute the program of the executable to run. This is done using a syscall of the family. 

The key difference could be the search time over a much larger . May this folder on the server contains a very large amount of any kind of files which increase the duration required to find all files into this tree. Server-side might be slow too. Next command can give you an idea of this (counts the number of files and folders in ): 

Did you analyze time-stamps of those files? My first guess is that files are auto-regenerated immediately after their deletion, from their source. You can see if they get really deleted using a verbose deletion as follow: 

Detail Looks like your hard drive is actually 500 000 000 000 bytes. This is very common with hard drives capacity. This does not equal 500 GiB since in computing one KiB is 1024 bytes (not 1000 as in real life). Hence this equals to . Even when you see GB, MB or KB in computer software, those are actually GiB, MiB and KiB most of the time because this is the way a computer counts. Windows should have printed to be accurate. Hard drives capacity is often announced in 1000-based units which makes it appears greater, because 500 GB looks great even if it is smaller than 500 GiB. Sump up Your hard drive is both 500 GB (pure human counting) and 465 GiB (computer counting). Few more fingers 

ClamAV packages ClamAV antivirus is splitted in several debian packages named , and as stated in debian (jessie) package webpage: 

You will see there is a bunch of services. Only a very few of them is started in recovery mode which lower the risk of issue. You can then start some more services manually if you want, backup your files and try to fix any boot issue before rebooting in standard run level (usually or ). 

uses a client-server architecture to access your device. Let's say you want to into a device. You need to instances of . 

A fast look at man page suggests that , , , , are maybe the only commands supported inside an . Hence, you may need to move you command before starting a session. Try this: 

Those two special folders exists in every folders on your system, hence they exists in both the source () and backup copy () of your music folder. Maybe the source music folder contains some hidden items. If so you can show them with the command (hidden items are not listed by default). If you are using Windows 10, then showing them on the graphical file Explorer is also easy (there is a direct button in the menu). 

You need to add quotes to your multi-word argument. Otherwise only the first word is seen as an argument of . The same for using different quotes to avoid ambiguity. Example: 

VLC MRLs are based on URIs which syntax allows for the insertion of optional scheme-specific userinfo: 

First of all, a bit of terminology. An executable is a simple file in your system. A process is the nutshell which executes the program embedded in an executable file. 

I guess your Windows Server 2008 has ping replies disabled in its firewall. You should either enable ping replies or let ping replies blocked and continue to setup services you want and allow them in the firewall. 

Note: Commands starting with are for machines. As an interactive human you need to use commands starting with . Do not type but hit key instead. 

In fact, I think hope such option will remains in the future for anyone being able to re-install a crashed win10-upgraded computer using their win7 activation key. 

You need to enable the kvm support on your host system. This support takes the form of a kernel module, either statically or dynamically built. Obviously it is not statically built in your case (it would have been auto-enabled). Try to search an available dynamic kernel modules this way: 

Last tip I encourage you to only select result from the host argument, or the URL protocol. Especially, routing several URLs of a single website through different external IPs is not always supported because some website expects a user to have a stable IP address during its entire navigation. A bunch of load-balancing example have this downside. 

Do the same with port 443/tcp (https traffic) if you serve it as well (ex: 443 -> 8443). Once done, you don't even need to bother with you virtual machine IP address to access its website. Just browse and you are done. Notes: 

ClamAV daemon notes Note that reading your needs, I guess you might never want to start (clamav-daemon) which goal is mostly dedicated to mail-server connectivity and on-access file scanning. Anyway, both options above should address your issue. The first option will also save ~1MiB of disk space which is not significant. 

Programs which create new files defines their permissions. Permissions given to a newly created file from a shell is often restricted to which is the default on most Linux distributions. You can edit your private login scripts such as , or system-wide scripts to edit this default and give it a more restrictive value. But most of the time it is okay to keep it as is since you are likely to have all your private files in your home directory. You only need to check your home directory permissions to block unwanted users from listing () and traversing () it. 

( command defaults to edit password of current user, but also accepts a user name as optional parameter to select which password to change) 

You are looking for the exact same system this recent question required. The answer given (python concurrent-based script) will perfectly fit your needs once adapted a small bit for your simpler case.
