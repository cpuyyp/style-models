If you type C: you get some error.. maybe invalid drive specification. So type FDISK and create a new partition and then click Machine..Reset Then if you do C: you get a different error like General failure reading drive C, that means it's there it just needs to be formatted. So do then click machine..reset you can even remove the flopy drive so device..floppy.. then uncheck the image. Now that's stage 1 done. You have MSDOS booting to a C prompt. You just need DOS SHELL now. So Stage 2 - that's the stage for getting DOS SHELL I found this website $URL$ $URL$ I figured there was a high "risk" of getting an "Incorrect MS-DOS version error" which is an error i've never really got to the bottom of in 20 years of computing so i'm glad not to have gotten that error. You won't either. Then I looked to make a floppy image I downloaded a program that'd do it WinImage.. it'a a trial program but it is OK for this $URL$ I tried adding the DOS SHELL files to the original image but it said the image was full. So within Win Image, I did file..new, then dragged the files into it and it put them in. Then File..Save As. And I named the image. Win Image lets you save as imz which is compressed, or as IMA. Go for IMA not IMZ. Virtualbox or DOS rather, doesn't recognize IMZ And remember your DOS system in virtualbox is booting from C now. And you're not making a bootable image this time. Just an image with DOS SHELL on it. So now do DIR from A: so and you see dos shell files there. do 

I have classic menu for ms office, it gives me a tools menu, then rather than options it has "word options", 

I hope you can get a more specific answer than mine, but this is the general idea. What you could look for is a Command or small program that can go to the next slide in powerpoint. This could be a program that just sends SPACE to the screen Then you need to look how to execute that command remotely As you say, a socket based script, but then you'll have to concern yourself with port forwarding. You could just set up port forwarding at your end, and they connect. And the program when started, listens for a space and when it hears it it sends a space to be executed on the connected machines. You could ask some individual questions on stackoverflow that lead you to making it, but I don't think they'll be keen on writing your program for you. 

You could make text color white for any text you want to hide. Or, you could just use 2 different templates, and use one with the extra text, and one without. To follow on from that, uou could make 2 ms word icons. One starts word with one template, one starts word with the other template. Here is a webpage on word startup switches $URL$ Ideal may be a macro to toggle whether letterhead or not, and set the correct printer and possibly print too. But I don't know how you'd go about that. 

I went to Yahoo Messenger, then clicked Messenger and "My Account Info" I then got this page You want to click Manage yahoo aliases. It's not the same as the yahoo aliases in email options. Once you add them there, you can log in as any, or in a chat window just above where you type a message, you cah choose "send as" and choose any of them. 

I installed Total Copy on a machine a while back $URL$ I want to get rid of it. When I right click dragging a folder into another folder, I get a context menu apppear offering me to copy with total copy. I don't want that option to appear. I don't see Total Copy in add/remove programs, and I can't see its EXE, i'm not sure if it uses one. 

Added I don't yet know how it went into that mode. It has been pointed out in comment that I can click that "tab" where it says header and footer tools, and then I can click "close". Then though what happens is the image I have in my document gets greyed out and I see no cursor. Then when I double click in the document, I get the cursor and the image is no longer greyed out but I am in that header footer mode again. Here is an example, see header and footer mode is closed but the image is greyed out and the cursor if it's even there, isn't going within or before the text above the circle picture, even when I click in that text. 

That's a good question. And at home when you just have one router then technically you could just use MAC addresses for communication between computers on the LAN. If there was a protocol that didn't touch IP.. though i'm not sure there is one in practice. Even ARP which is considered Layer 2.5 still includes an IP address. And the way protocols are written e.g. HTTP, it relies on IP and MAC. It's additional complexity in order to deal with situations where the computers aren't just communicating with each other all behind one router. 

Edited for clarification Moving through the taskbar manually with arrow keys is very inefficient and only useful when one has no mouse. I want to move the mouse manually to point to which icon's windows I want to close, then one Click/some combo, and close all of them. I guess the best i have so far is right click, up, enter. 

In very technical terms, No, formatting doesn't delete everything. But practically, unless he'd doing some advanced data recovery, if he looks on the drive for any files, and the drive is formatted, he won't see any files there. And if it's a 150GB drive, the drive comes up as having 150GB free. If you want to really wipe the drive so data is unrecoverable even by advanced data recovery techniques, then I suppose writing zeros on the drive will do it. But it's most probably not necessary to do that. When you format it, then all the programs and files are gone (data recovery aside). If you want to remove your personal files, and have everything as default, then one option is contact your laptop manufacturer. Sometimes they provide a CD/DVD that has a process that puts the laptop back to how it was when you bought it. If it didn't have Office originally, it won't have it when you do that. And if it had junk software on it originally (like McAffee - a bloated anti virus program), then it will have that on there again. Sometimes they have an option at startup to do it. You could remove personal files manually. You know what your personal files are. And note that -technically- deleting files doesn't delete them, it just deletes references to them.. So somebody that knows data recovery techniques could 'undelete' them. But I don't think you or your friend are likely to be doing data recovery but there are programs to delete files securely. This program $URL$ but that's really if you want to be paranoid. Many people just delete files and consider them deleted. If you had sensitive info and your friend was very technical and a thief and cunning then you might want to use that program.. or better, not give him your laptop.
