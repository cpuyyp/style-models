Wildcard certificates only works with a single level of domain name. So if you have a cert for *.domain.ac.in it will work for 111.domain.ac.in, 222.domain.ac.in but not for 111.111.domain.ac.in. More details are available on wikipedia 

Under "Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection" you should have an IPv4 address listed (and not an auto-discovered one like 169.254.xxx.xxx) If that works, the start nslookup (still from the command line and type 

PHP run with the same permissions as the user that you assigned to your web site. Which user exactly is taken into account depends on many things. Here is a short list that should allow you to identify the account in question: 

(or sometimes straight ) Which tells the mail client that there is multiple parts in the message. At this stage, each part must indicate what type it is supposed to be in (in addition to several other parameters). All that to say that, if you mail application sends the message as plain text and you want to convert that as HTML, you will have to, at the very least, change the message's content-type header in addition to change the message body itself. 

Frankly, use the host file. The reason it exists is to fix problems like the one you describe and so there is no reason not to use it. Disabling IPv6 is unsupported and will break functionalities (although nothing critical). It is a far more disruptive change than touching the host file. 

When looking at the WSUS 3.0 API, there is no way I can find if a given update is needed or not. The UpdateInstallationState enum has a value with the following description: "The update is not applicable to the client computer". Meeaning, that update may be already installed and therefore is not applicable anymore to the target computer. The Powershell code will count for each update the number of computer target on which the update is applicable. 

You might have to load the module. To find out if it is supplied with your kernel, run the following: 

We can divide mail management in two parts, mail transfer and mail delivering. Postfix is a Mail Transfer Agent meaning that it will move emails from one server to another using the SMTP protocol. Dovecot is a Mail Delivery Agent which will deliver the received emails to your mail client using the IMAP or POP3 protocols. When sending an email from your email client, you will directly talk to your MTA while to get new emails, you speak with your MDA. So, yes you need Postfix if you want to send emails for this email account. 

I think you should use the physical interface only as a physical layer. You don't assign any IP address to this interface but instead, you create virtual interfaces bounded to which will take care of the IP transport. 

In the administration page of alwaysdata, go to Sites then edit your site properties. You can here add addresses that match your site. Just add as a new address and save. 

I have seen such a behavior already (and apparently, you and me are not the only ones). In my case, the problem was caused by having machines with duplicate SID in the domain due to a HDD clone followed by a sysprep without having checked the "generalized" checkbox. You can get the same issue if you're running cloned/P2Ved VMs. 

No, that makes no sense. While it's true that some handles can be shared (inherited, actually) between processes, it doesn't make any sense outside the scope of programming. 

For more information, I suggest you start with the wikipedia article about the DNS system and, if you're really interested, go on with reading the first few of the numerous RFCs related to DNS (listed in the the wikipedia article but the most interesting ones are probably 1034, 1035 and 1591. 

I'm writing a tool to generate self-signed X509 certificates and X509 certificate requests and I'm wondering how the "critical" property of the SubjectAlternativeName (OID 2.5.29.17) should be handeled. The documentation isn't too clear for me. Should I: 

Ok, you should first read about Active Directory before doing anything more. AD is a directory service: it contains users, computers and all sorts of references that are used inside a "security domain", usually a company or department. It's a central location to manage these accounts. When you install the AD role on a server, all "local" users become domain users. That's one of the reason you typically do NOT install anything on the same machine as AD. In your case, it doesn't makes any sense to install AD on your server: AD only makes sense if you want to centralize account management between several machines. Now, if you want to perform your test properly, you will need to remove AD from your server (or, preferably, reinstall it completely), install a separate 2008R2 server on which you will install AD and then join your application server to that domain. Only then can you attempt to use AD accounts for your application. Be warned, though, that AD isn't just a network service: you need to install all the infrastructure that comes with it (mostly, that's DNS but it also means you'll need a static IP address). Again, I urge you to start reading about AD: it will not be time lost for anyone who has to work with Windows networks. At the very least, have a look at the Wikipedia article about Active Directory and try reading on of the (numerous) AD beginner's guide available on the net. 

This happens only with some files and newly created one. When I look at the file defined and effective permissions, everything is all right. And to conclude this seems to be related to my user's computer. I logged him on another computer with the same configuration and it worked fine until the first caching. The only enabled policies are redirected folders and offline files cache encryption. Thinking of a problem with the user's profile, I removed both local and remote folders with no effects. Now I have no idea how to solve this issue. For your information, a Windows Server 2003 is running the Active Directory service while the files are stored on a Windows Server 2008. 

This question has already been answered here. On most POSIX systems, multiple slashes are simply ignored. 

A better solution would be to have multiple backend servers and balance the load over the members and detect offline servers using the parameter. So, when you reboot a backend server, another one could take the relay. 

Setting in the file should be enough. You can also disable it from the kernel. Edit the file and add to the variable and update your GRUB configuration: 

Some registrar asks for the hostname instead of IP address. Your name server should therefore have an record like . 

The record will not impact your emails as long as you setup the correct record. If you want to receive emails for @example.com, you can setup your zone this way:
