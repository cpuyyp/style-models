You specify PBR on the incoming interface. Packets that are generated by the router (such as ) are not normally policy-routed. Logical concepts including subnet masking and wildcard masking are applicable. 

The topology is independent of the framing type. Frame type is defined at the data link layer of the OSI model. Cable type is defined at the physical layer of the OSI model. 

You will need an Ethernet switch to terminate the links to the Access Points and any other wired IP endpoints. You will also need a security gateway that provides URL/Content Filtering (no browsing gambling, profane sites, etc.) as well as firewall features. The public network needs to be child appropriate. A key factor is the required number of AP's. There are 2 approaches - coverage based or capacity based. If you are going to have 300 people show up in a church or conference hall with many of them using your WiFi, you need to plan for this. A capacity based predictive model can guide you. See Meraki's High Density Wi-Fi Deployment Guide The AP's will likely be powered by the network cable but copper only works for 300 feet. Beyond that you use fiber cable. They make fiber to copper media converters with PoE+ which might be what you need. Contact a "Structured Cabling provider" to get all this cable run and AP's installed. Hope that helps. 

(Total) Nodal Delay The (total) nodal delay on the other hand is the sum of all latency delays. There are exactly four delays: 

I assume in my question that we all agree that TCP/IP consists of four layers. Yes, I've seen different views on this as well. Mainly people adding a fifth layer at the bottom for the physical stuff or they added a fifth layer beneath the application layer, just to place TLS there. As far as I understand the whole thing, TLS (and the old dying SSL), are situated in the application layer of TCP/IP and acting as a wrapper around other application layer protocols (e.g. HTTP). Further they act on behalf of e.g. TCP, but the protocol is merely sitting in front of the actual application protocol rather than in the transport layer and sharing the space with TCP. Well, I'd love to hear a clarification of this maybe not so important problem. 

#1 BGP is required only if the provider offers no other dynamic routing protocol. In this case, your BGP peering is confined to your VRF within the providers cloud and can accept/pass private subnets to your remote sites. #2 No. 

The link aggregation group (LAG) type must be supported and match on both the endpoint and the networking device. NIC teaming is a term that you might google along with the make/model of your respective endpoint NIC cards and or OS version. Microsoft indicates: 

If you are using BFD with uRPF on a particular interface, then you need to use the command to disable echo mode on that interface; otherwise, echo packets are rejected. You can disable echo mode for the entire router, or for an individual interface. Only the static, OSPF, and IS-IS applications are supported on BFD over bundle VLANs. 

(Nodal) Processing Delay The (nodal) processing delay is every device along the communication path that actually processes/examines the packets; these include routers, switches, and statistical multiplexers. The receiver doesn’t count towards this delay because the receiver is the receiver and has received the packet at that point, it doesn’t matter what will be done on its side with the signal.[1][2] Regarding proxies and VPNs: yes, every device that does anything with the packets counts towards the delays. Especially NATs (rewriting) or devices that perform deep packet inspection add a lot of processing time. 

The queue delay may reach infinity and the whole network suffers from congestion collapse; which actually happened during the 1980s and was the reason why Congestion Avoidance and Control was invented. 

Do the inter-VLAN routing on the switch because the performance is much better vs a router on a stick topology (where the inter-VLAN routing is done on the router via Ethernet subinterfaces on a trunk). 

show interface history To display histograms of interface utilization, use the showinterfacehistory command in privileged EXEC mode. 

The out-of-band management / direct connect type links to the physical box should be used because it removes administrator connectivity to the infrastructure from the list of potential problems and tasks. SSH accessible VPN and terminal server with public IP addresses from either the wired or LTE interfaces. iLOM/Embedded Server Management interfaces could be covered along with the networking boxes. It's long been the tradition that when the power goes out, the phones (and data centers) still work; most 4GLTE cell towers have some timeframe of backup power. 

I have an endless amount of books and websites at my disposal, but this question stays totally unanswered, or rather every author invests his own solution for this problem. It's even placed within different layers depending on which Wikipedia article you're just reading. 

It was already clarified by Steffen Ullrich what happens to the TCP connection. I'd like to answer your side question as well. Because of the IPv4 address exhaustion many ISPs around the world still rely on IP leases. A change every minute isn't realistic, but a change every 24 h is what usually happens. The reason is simply because they don't have enough addresses to give each client its dedicated IP. This situation will change with IPv6 which has enough addresses in the foreseeable future. 

Ideally, only have one IP subnet per VLAN. So, undo the overlapping VLANs or re-IP address the overlapping subnets. Either way would work. 

Your server is not behind a router if it is getting a public IP address from ISP1 via DHCP. A DNS A record can take a secondary IP address. Use that for the failover/backup access. 

You can, and you should. If the switches are stacking switches then you can even have the ports on 2 separate switches. It's a rather simple port-channel configuration on the router and switch. Cisco has a document explaining this, Configuring EtherChannel and 802.1Q Trunking Between Catalyst L2 Fixed Configuration Switches and a Router (InterVLAN Routing). 

Respectfully, I think you're going about it wrong. Web servers are targeted with web addresses, namely, DNS records. So, your server might be mysever.mydomain.com. All you gotta do is set your DNS up appropriately and resolve inside users to the inside address. So, it's a DNS configuration issue.
