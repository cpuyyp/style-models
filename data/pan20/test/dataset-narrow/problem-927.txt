You can see that I loaded the correct monitor driver. Changing the frequency does not work/has no effect, it will always jump back to 59Hz when reopening the dialog. 

My UEFI/GPT installation of Windows 10, 64-bit doesn't boot anymore. It's stuck somewhere in the bootloading process with a blank screen and no error message, I cannot tell at which point exactly. I suspect that something has been written into the UEFI firmware's NVRAM that prevents Windows from starting up. Opening the drive on another machine reveals that the partitions, file systems and data are all there and fine. It just doesn't boot anymore. For possibly unrelated reasons not relevant to this question, I'm unable to boot into the Windows RE environment, but I can boot from Linux USB drives, for example. Is there a way to repair the BCD and the other bootloader files of Windows 10 without booting into WinRE? If I understand correctly, commands like bcdedit affect the NVRAM of the UEFI firmware, so I cannot run those on another machine "against an external drive" that I've mounted, can I? Any other way to do the same thing, possibly from a live Linux system? 

You can connect your MacBook Air to your HP computer as long as the computer can capture an input (via a expansion card, etc.). You can then display your screen with any software that is able to display inputs. OR the simplest way to go on about doing this is to connect your desktop monitor directly into the MacBoook Air. This is by far the easiest and the fastest way. 

So, If you did not format your hard drive and it has not been 28 days since you have installed Windows 8.1, you're in luck. You can simply go ahead and use the automatic diagnostic tool (provided in the link) which will retrieve your personal data and put it back in place. If you don't want that, you can go ahead and recover the bookmarks manually. Every browser works differently in terms of bookmark saving location and importing options so I'll list the three most popular Windows browsers and how to recover each of their bookmarks.

I've got two HP ZR24w external monitors. Used for years. A few weeks ago, I turned the system off in the evening while it was still working fine, and when I turned it back on the next morning, one of the monitors started behaving oddly. Here's the current situation: I just got a new laptop. When I connect the 'broken' monitor via an HDMI-to-DVI cable. The monitor shows an active DVI signal, but no image. Windows does not detect a monitor at all. I unplug the monitor and connect the DVI end of the same cable to the other monitor. It works perfectly, uses the native resolution and Windows detects the display. I also ran a subset of the tests with Ubuntu 14.10. Bottom line: 'broken' monitor connected via HDMI-to-DVI cable doesn't work, other monitor is detected automatically. So it's not a pure OS problem either. I think at this point, we can conclude that there's something broken with the hardware of the first monitor, possibly the EDID? However, here's the oddity: I also have a DL-195, a USB-to-DVI converter. With that, I can connect the 'broken' monitor to my old laptop and it's working at the correct resolution, even though Windows lists it as "No Monitor". Here's what it looks like when it works (even though it says "No Monitor", but the resolution is correct and it works perfectly well): 

Open Device Manager Expand the Battery category and Right Click > Uninstall the Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery listing. Click the Scan for Hardware (last one to the right) button in the taskbar. 

Start Chrome and Open the Chrome Menu Go to Settings > Extensions (On the left hand side) Delete all of the extensions that you haven't installed by pressing the trash button on the right. 

The network admins for your organization should know what group they need to add you in. By the sound of it, would most likely be the group that you need to be added into but you can be added to any of those groups to get access (I doubt they would add you to the Administrators group though). Once added to the group, you should be able to easily view the . 

you should be able to technically see the uninstall button. If you don't find the string than the program's registry was edited and the uninstall string doesn't exists. This could be caused by malicious content or as a result of program not being installed properly. IT could also be that you're not logged into to the admin account or the account that installed those applications. Most of the icons for the programs are not shown so my best guess would be that they have been uninstalled improperly. Solution You can either find each program's msi, exe and uninstall it using the proper switch but this option will take lots of time and research for each program that you would like to uninstall. For example to uninstall uTorrent, you would either create a batch file or open up a command prompt screen and paste this line: 

Here's some info on a related use case: You want to redirect the output inside the container, which is running on Docker Cloud. In my case, I'm executing a long-running data analysis script (Java) on Docker Cloud. Each container is supposed to write its own results file. I'm using the image and overwrite the 'Run command' with the following line: 

In closing, there's obviously a hardware problem. But in one specific configuration, the monitor still fully works on the old laptop. Do I nevertheless have to throw it away and buy a new one? Or can I force its detection (in Windows) somehow to make it work on the new laptop? 

When connecting the same setup to my new laptop, Windows will display "No Monitor" and give me a selection of resolutions. No matter what I choose here, the monitor will display 1280x1024. Here's one more data point that I can't figure out what it means: when I connect the 'broken' monitor via the HDMI port to my old laptop, it gives me a couple of weird resolutions (e.g. 1920x1080, 1680x1050, 1400x1050), but not 1920x1200. The refresh rate is shown as 59Hz instead of the usual 60Hz. I can change it and apply the change, the screen flickers and the new refresh rate is displayed, but opening the same dialog will show it as 59Hz again. Here's what it looks like when connected to the old laptop via HDMI, stuck at the wrong resolutions at 59Hz: 

Can I see your excel sheet data that you're trying to use auto fill on? You basically just have to create a formula once and you can use the autofill feature to use the formula with the other data sets. So if you have multiple columns of data, you first create a new row that contains average, another that contains minimum, and another that contains the maximum. To get these values simple click on the arrow next to the AutoSum feature in the top right corner of the HOME tab and choose the respective calculation. After that is done for one column, you can use the autofill feature by selecting the three column cells and use the fill handle in the bottom right corner of the selected cells. This should use the same formulas on the other columns of data. Example: 

Glancing at the documentation, it seems like the battery is internal. I'll assume you laptop model is Q502LA. There are a few options you can try. Battery Status Indicator First please check the battery status indicator on the front side of your laptop. It is the indicator in the middle. It can be one of the following light status: Solid Green, Solid Orange, Blinking Orange, or Lights Off. Based on the battery status indicator we can gain extra information about the status of the battery. Drive Reinstall If that does not work out, we can try to reinstall the Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery driver. To do this, do the following:
