This should be a simple process,but coming from a Mac background I find doing anything involving formatting and or installation of system software incredibly arcane in the PC world. My issue is I was getting the dreaded BSOD on boot. After tons of googling, system level and anti malware scans etc, I came to the conclusion it was probably some typeof System kernel level compatability issue with 3rd party drivers. The issue seemed to resolve itself on its own but I couldn't sure it wasn't a virus or malware of some sort. So I opted to completely reformat my hard drive and reinstall Windows. 1st problem > I don't have a recovery disc. More googling and discovered I needed to recover my Product Key, download official Windows 8 ISO, and create a proper recovery disc. I chose the USB option. 2nd problem>when trying to reinstall Windows from my recovery USB, I get an error message saying that the product key doesn't match.... More googling and the suggested solution is to create a custom PID.txt file containing your officialWindows 8 Product key. Tried this but didn't work, same message. I give up! So far an entire weekend wasted on what should a simple 2-3hour process!! Can any windows-hardware gurus help? 

After a bit of googling I rebooted in safe mode and repeated the above with same results. A bit of googling later I tried installing a 3rd party utility 'lockhunter' but am unable to install, getting the message 

Trying to make sapce on my C drive. I see that my Appdata/Local/Packages folder is almost 20GB! Is it safe to delete this? If not, can it be 'pruned' without affecting installed applications? 

On boot I need to run the 3 following processes sequentially, and optionally define a delay between each 1- launch a node js server 2- launch a browser (shortcut) 3- launch an application In Windows 7, what is the best way to accomplish this? 

Done a lot of googling but all the info seems dated and refers to older versions of Windows $URL$ Can any Windows experts tell me how to set up an outgoing SMTP mail server in Windows 10? 

also tried lutyuv=y=val*4 to increase brightness but then my black background appears grey. I guess I need the equivalent of a custom curve that holds the blacks and only lightens the midtones-highlights. 

Trying to increase available space in way too small (250GB) internal iMac drive. I noticed my Library folder is over 60GB! cache folder alone inside Library over 18GB! What can 'safely' be deleted from my Library folder? 

Using 2 external drives for backup and archiving. The 2nd drive needs to be a mirror copy of the first. Can anyone give their recommendation for the best synchronizing tool? A quick google search gave me these free options $URL$ but am willing to pay if there is a better solution. 

OP I checked MOBO manual for ASUS X99A2- solution was to short 2 pins for 10-15 seconds after first shutting down and removing power cord. If someone knows of a software only solution... 

Using the following instructions to install Nvidia drivers on a new Centos 7 + MATE install $URL$ Attempting to blacklist nouveau by issuing the following command 

Have successfully mounted an MTP device on the desktop in Ubuntu and have figured out where the mount point is. If I cd to /run/user/999/gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C006%5D$ I see 'SD card' But this is also what I see on the desktop. How can I cd INSIDE the SD card to copy photos or videos? 

Ok so everything was working, external HD monitor connected to my Dell XPS15 9550. But when booting this morning can't see the 2nd display in Display Options.(Windows 10) Tried switching cables to eliminate that issue I was making changes to my System Configuration so my best guess is that some driver has been disabled..but I tried switching back my Startup selection to Normal startup, no difference!. Can anyone suggest some next troubleshooting steps? 

whenever I try to connect to a socket server on a PC with a fresh Windows install. I've turned all firewalls off. Is there something else in windows I can check? Error 12029 seems like a generic error, is there any way to debug these types of websocket errors? 

I've tried several times now. I format a 120GB USB3.0 drive as FAT32 using gParted in Ubuntu(from a live USB) then when I try and mount in Windows 10 it doesn't mount. I then open Disk Management and have no option but to reformat the RAW partition as ExFat. What could cause the gParted FAT32 parition to not be recognized in Win10? 

ok I know this is backwards but after spending half a day doing a clean install of Windows and updating drivers I'd prefer to not have to repeat the process. I'd like to simply partition my SSD in half. Can I do this properly AFTER having already installed windows? is there a recommended(no malware) 3rd party app that can accomplish this? 

I'm following these instructions $URL$ but so far have had no luck. I'm getting an error when installing the Sensor KinectMod saying I need OpenNI 1.2.0.4 or greater(even though I have the latest OpenNI2 installed) and also in my device manager I don't see any PrimeSense devices listed after plugging in my Kinect. I'm also confused by what the ' OpenNI Compliant HARDWARE Binaries' are and where I should download them. Can anyone point me to an up to date tutorial for installing OpenNI with a Xbox Kinect device on Windows8? 

So what gives. Why is this so difficult? I used both a 3rd party tool and a command line option to retrieve my product key so fairly sure its accurate. 

I have the following FFMPEG command which simply wipes text from left to right. What I am trying to do is determine the total width of the text string so I can subtract this amount from the x position value, starting it off stage left. Since this is determined by both the font size and the actual font used I am guessing this is impossible to determine accurately...but is there a way to fudge this ? 

Can anyone tell me if there exists an app that simplifies setting up port forwarding on OSX without using the terminal? 

I've downloaded and installed the Quartz package from here $URL$ I've also downloaded, installed and setup the vnc2flv Python package here $URL$ Now to run flvrec.py I believe I first need to start the X11 server, but haven't a clue how to do so from the OSX terminal. 

I have a Unity project that loads external movie files as movie textures. The .mov files are loaded using relative pathing. On the mac, I get it to work after compiling by simply copying my videos folder (.ogvs) into the compiled application by first selecting it and 'showing package Contents'. Simple stuff. But on the PC with an .exe I'm not sure how to accomplish the same thing. Is there a way to 'look inside' an .exe on the PC, and copy files there? 

Coming from an Eclipse background where I did lots of Java and AS3 coding its frustrating trying to format my code and classes in Visual Studio. In Eclipse there was-is a plugin, PrettyPrint which allowed powerful 1 click formatting, removing of blank lines, indenting, etc. Is there anything similar for formatting C# code with VisualStudio ? 

Experiencing some strange voodoo with a recent Centos 7 + MATE install. I'm pretty sure the issues(Houdini doesn't launch anymore, strange behavior in installing plugins etc) are driver related and want to 'roll back' to an earlier version. However I didn't create any backup or restore point. Can any linux gurus suggest the best method for creating backups or restore points of just the system + any drivers installed? My plan now is to start from scratch and reformat my SSD, do a complete reinstall. There goes another weekend! Also was wondering, are other flavors of linux equally sensitive to driver related issues? Perhaps switch to Ubuntu, Fedora, or even downgrade to Centos 6 from 7? Any feedback appreciated! 

So I have a Dell XPS 15 with a NVidia 960M GPU. This is just below recommended specs but from my understanding should still be able to work with the HTC Vive. Using the Nvidia control panel you can tell any application to use the high performance discreet GPU, which is what I have done. What is most confusing is that when I run the test, I can confirm that the discreet card is being used, but at completion, the performance test suggests upgrading my gpu and only lists the internal Intel HD530.Funky! 

I've read mixed reports online about the ability to convert basic SWF files to a video format using FFMPEG. Can any FFMPEG experts suggest whether there is a way to get this to work reliably? Using the very simplest of options 

Trying to do some housekeeping, recover disk space. I see My Caches folder is over 10GB. Is it safe to delete? 

Purchased Nero 2016 recently with the intent to burn BluRays for archiving. I have an Asus N56VZ laptop running Windows 10. The combo drive is a MATSHITA-BD-CMB UJ160 which I have been told by Asus tech support as being Blu-ray comatible. However, whenever I try and burn a Blu-ray disc I get the following error in Nero BurningROM 2016 (and I definitely have the correct recorder chosen in the recorder drop down). 

I have an Openframeworks install that I thoroughly tested and relaunch on a daily basis. Every few days I encounter the wonderful OSX 'spinning beach ball' and the entire application is frozen, and I am not even able to log in remotely. There are obviously a ton of possibly causes, but can anyone suggest some troubleshooting steps? Is it possible this is a memory leak issue? 

So Ive searched apple support and googled a bit but any solution Ive come across is either outdated $URL$ or assumes you are using OSX with a Bootcamp partition. I am running Windows 10 and have purchased a Apple extended keyboard but have lost all access to things like single and double quotes etc. What can I do to regain full use of my keyboard (cant type a question mark since I get Ã‰ instead :) 

Having a Windows 10 activation issue which I think is specific to Dell laptops. Did a clean windows 10 install on my Dell XPS 15. Under settings-Activation there is an error which says 

On Mac when I set up a wifi hotspot, the ip is easy to determine. But I set up my Windows 8 laptop as a wifi hotspot and am unable to figure out its IP. I need the Ip in order to set up socketServers. I tried IPCONFIG /ALL in cmd but I get a list of Physical Addresses for all adapters.
