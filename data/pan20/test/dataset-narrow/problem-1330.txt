The following image depicts the scaling effect of the game (left), in a portrait (center) and landscape (right) screen respectively 

Where A is the duration of the clank from where the movement starts slowing down until the end of the ease transition, and B is how deep is the valley measured on a line perpendicular to that intersects the line at . 

How is it called, what is it used for, and what is the most common way to implement it? I know these are three question in one, but since the first and second are just one-liners I decided to make them into one. The following images are two screenshots showing the visual effect; (A) show the zones that are darker and (B) the normal zones 

You're on the right track with figuring out when the mouse is transitioning from down to up and writing a handler for that. For a lot of games, it's good enough to treat a mouseUp event as a click. Depending on your game, you're probably want to handle both events -- for example, in an RTS, you'll probably want to incorporate drag-box selecting as well as single-click selecting. The difference is in determining how long the mouse was in the Down state before it's released. (Yes, you basically answered your own question) 

It appears that my Update function was being called at least twice before anything was being displayed, and that even though the bullets were part of the collection they were becoming disabled before being drawn and thus textures not loaded (?!?). By setting the lifetime (which is decremented once per Update, and when lifetime = 0 the bullets are no longer Visible/Enabled) of each Bullet to 3 or greater (this may vary depending on CPU speed?) when I instantiate the Bullets as part of the ship class, the textures are properly loaded at the beginning of the game. I'm still not sure why manually setting them to Enabled/Visible at creation doesn't force the texture to be loaded. 

The point is, what do I need to do for the engine's editor to start showing the exposed variable in blueprints? I'm working with UE 4.9 downloaded from the Epic Games Launcher application. 

You know those mechanisms that moved or rotated, and then just a few millimeters near the end of the trajectory they oppose a bit of resistance and then clank to the final position. I want to simulate that clank with an ease function that can be combined with the standard ease actions. The link is for reference to some examples of ease transition functions, but I just need the pseudocode like this: 

The first five times I shoot() (that is, once for each bullet object that the ship is allotted), there is lag that I think is due to the bullet sprite being loaded. I've tried setting Visible and Enabled to true in the ship constructor loop where the Bullets are instantiated, but the first-five-shots lag persists. Any shots beyond the first five are completely lag-free. How do I load the Bullets properly ahead of time so that there is no lag on the first shots? 

I have a small 2D game I'm working on in XNA. So far, I have a player-controlled ship that operates on vector thrust and is terribly fun to spin around in circles. I've implemented this as a DrawableGameComponent and registered it with the game using game.Components.Add(this) in the Ship object constructor. How can I implement features like pausing and a menu system with my current implementation? Is it possible to set certain GameComponents to not update? Is this something for which I should even be using a DrawableGameComponent? If not, what are more appropriate uses for this? 

dot product is negative when the angle between the two vectors is greater than 90ยบ, for the code to work properly you would need to take the absolute value of the dot product. 

So, when the simulation runs Pelvis and Spine 2 get pushed apart reducing the overlapping to a contact point. 

How can I change the dimensions of the capsule for one bone in the physics assets tool? The problem is that bones not connected by joints have overlapping collision volumes in the mannequin that comes with the starter content, which causes those body parts to apear dislocated or out of place when the simulation is running. For instance in this image the pelvis and the middle bone in the spine (Spine 2) are overlapping. 

Note that these are just recommendations, not cut-and-dry human thresholds for epileptic triggers. If your game violates any of these guiding principles, there is a good chance it may be dangerous; however, if it doesn't, that's still no guarantee that it is safe. Sources: $URL$ $URL$ 

One way to do this would be to base the spawn not on time but on horizontal distance traveled (assuming sidescrolling). You can store your enemy waves in a queue with a trigger distance; when your player's distance traveled is greater than the trigger distance of the object at the front of the queue, pop it from the queue and spawn it. This solution would lend itself more to integration with a graphical level editor than a time-based solution. It'd make it much easier to match up specific points along your scrolling background with when the enemies spawn. 

To test the suggested technique create a new project, then choose the iOS > cocos2d > cocos2d_box2d template. After creating the project go to HelloWorldLayer.mm and change the method like this 

Since vector algebra is GPU friendly, normalizations and dot products can be used to find the four corners of the original plane as follow: 

I would like to expose to blueprints the variable CurrentTouchInterface in the class APlayerController, just like the method APlayerController::ActivateTouchInterface. So, I'm guessing I have to change the header file PlayerController.h from this 

Given the projector point (P), the projected point (B), one arbitrary point on the plane that contains the distorted rectangle (Q), and the normal vector to that plane (n), the point of intersection (A) of the line from P to B, and the plane is given by 

I'm making a SpaceWar!-esque game using XNA. I want to limit my ships to 5 active bullets at any time. I have a Bullet and a Ship . My Ship has an array of 5 Bullet. What is the best way to manage the Bullet textures? Specifically, when should I be calling ? Right now, my solution is to populate the Bullet array in the Ship's constructor, with being called in the Bullet constructor. The Bullet objects will be disabled/not visible except when they are active. Does the texture really need to be loaded once for each individual instance of the bullet object? This seems like a very processor-intensive operation. Note: This is a small-scale project, so I'm OK with not implementing a huge texture-management framework since there won't be more than half a dozen or so in the entire game. I'd still like to hear about scalable solutions for future applications, though. 

You could calculate the path the car would describe if it turns with the current speed without drifting. Then apply brakes in proportion to the distant d, which is the distance measured from the calculated path to the curve. 

Where A and B are parameters passed to the ease function to indicate where to star the clank and how deep is the valley near the end of the curve, respectively. 

Each time I create a new project UE4 adds a generic bundle identifier to the iOS platform settings, that I always have to change to in order to be able to run the newly created project. So, I wonder how can I make UE4 to correctly auto detect this field from the picked provisioning profile. I was thinking something like putting (including the square brackets) but the editor crashes when I put that in the bundle identifier field. 

That's a pretty standard solution. Try hiding the mouse cursor and superimposing a fixed targeting reticule (if your game needs one) if it's a distraction 

I'm working on a SpaceWar-esque project to get comfortable with XNA. I have a Ship DrawableGameComponent and a Bullet DrawableGameComponent. The player's Ship is created at the start of the game, and the Bullets are created for each Ship as part of its constructor. In my Ship constructor, I have the following code: 

Many implementations may lead to a random weighted chance for moves -- say, a chance to make an optimal move and a chance to make a suboptimal move. Determining how suboptimal a move is could be a very tricky problem, but will also lead your AI to making much more seemingly-intelligent decisions. Important note: No matter the difficulty setting, it would probably be a bad idea to have the AI pass up a chance to immediately win the game. If there is a possibility to make a move that would finish the game that turn, it should always be taken. If not, it will absolutely destroy the player's impression of how the AI is acting.
