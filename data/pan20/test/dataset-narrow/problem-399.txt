Where by nature of the libpizzle, you would search the table for many and then get all the from the table, do some math and spit back a score for each signature how similar it was for the search. Then for each similiarity that was above a threshold I would get the data I needed from by looking up the It took about 5 minutes for 1 search to search 40,000,000 pictures - so I think there is room for improvement. Especially because I want this to be fast up to 500 million records. Should I seperate all the non-essential data (only about 1% the size, which is everything that is related to the specific picture) in a seperate database? On a seperate server? Because it's just doing a massive search for and spitting back all the 's that could be a match, I assume that not having any type of relation with the data can help me pick a specific technology that will maximize my speed. Which technology is best for this? 

I am using a solution of backblaze B2 / duplicity / duply to create backups of my databases. I upload full backups and incremental backups to B2 using duplicity via duply. The incrementals are done similar to rsync. My server is 100GB and my databases are currently 70GB, but I don't suspect them to grow much. I dont have a master/slave setup. I want a backup solution that allows me to backup the 70GB of databases but not require very much space during the backup process. I decided that I could just backup the whole directory instead of using or other backup methods which requires a full backup persist on disk. I read that in order to do this method I would have to completely turn off the mysql server, do the backup, and turn it back on. I am OK with that because duplicity does incremental backups which should only take a few minutes. I have ran in order to make shutdown/starup as fast as can be and verified via that hovers around 0. I also understand the caveat for InnoDB tables is that they require the exact same mysql version in order to properly restore. Is that still the case? Is there anything I am missing and will I have a near 100% confidence that if I use the exact mysql version (mariadb in my case) that at least one of my hundreds of incremental backups will restore. 

I will inserting into a database the signatures of 500,000,000 pictures. The signatures will be generated using libpuzzle. Each signature is 338 bytes. (so 160 GB) plus a table for searching (read more below). I would prefer to keep the main database on one VPS server with a standard HDD (No SSD because of cost issues). The most important aspect is search time, Insertion time does not matter. In the past I have attempted this all within MySQL (with way less records) and had one database for everything, the main searching happened with a scheme like: 

The expected outcome is an array aggregation with the renamed to and the relative aggregations. The problem with that functions is that I have to switch (and run 3 times) . Is there a way to unify it in one go? 

I think the best way is filtering the query or prefixing the data using commands like: ST_IsValidReason, ST_IsValid, ST_MakeValid. $URL$ 

which works fine but it is using a "LEFT JOIN" to inject the value '0' for the column 'v1'. Is there a better (possibly more efficient) way to do that? 

Using this setup will take the function to use as distance parameter "degrees" instead of "meters". How can I set the to work with meters? Is this the right setup? 

The comparison value () can change sometime, but I want to avoid to drop and recreate the materialized view each time. The only idea I came up with it is using an external table with some metadata values like the date needed: 

There are extra as first and last character and around instead of single . How can I get a valid json stripping unnecessary quotes? 

I have already asked a similar question here: Find the nearest geo points across two tables with Postgis (or without)? but now I am stuck around the correct geo-reference to calculate the distance in ST_DWithin. What I have did with my tables is creating a column in this way: 

I have created a "sample case" here for Postgres 10.0 (actually I am using AWS equivalent for 10.1): $URL$ where you can find the table: 

How can I group those values in a way that every single group has the closest possible value to 60000? For example (not probably the best fit): 

In a monthly time range that goes from '2001-01-01' to '2001-06-01', if there are missing following months, they get filled with the previous month values. The only difference is in the column 'v1' where the value for the missing month gets replaced with 0. The query that I am using at the moment is: 

Is there any other way to work around this limitation of materialized views on Postgres? One of the problems with my current solution is that you can have two or more materialized views that use the same value, but they may need at some of different values, so that require a duplication of the metadata table. 

due to Postgis (and relative used libraries). Is there a way to skip exceptional cases and keeping the query running until finished? 

So far I just came out with an awful so I am wondering is there a more elegant (and efficient) way to do it? 

Then you could also add some constraint to the table if you want to enforce a rule that two courses can't be timetabled at the same time. If a course has multiple sessions during the week each will be a row in this table. 

So to get to that format I have a query which grabs the distinct values of and by generating a of the values in each level, like this: 

When you created the clustered index with the rows in the table were shuffled to be in that order. When you dropped the index the rows were not reshuffled. There is no guarantee that the rows will be returned by a query in the order that they are stored, but often this is what happens. If the order is important then you would add an (and would be well advised to cluster the table on that field too to avoid sorting every time). But don't choose a clustering key just because of that. For a more thorough discussion of clustering and heaps see $URL$ 

It could go something like this. Grab the old data into a temp table. Insert it into the history table then delete from the live table. I'll leave the error handling as an exercise for the reader. 

It looks like you are attempting to give the value of back to the caller, but that is not the purpose of . When you give an argument after it must be an integer which indicates the status of the procedure. Better off declaring as an output parameter or . Ref. $URL$ 

Test this and see if progress is being made. Further steps may be necessary but hopefully this is in the right direction. 

That looks a little awkward, so if anyone can improve that date logic happy to take suggestions. If a doctor wants a break, then enter the break as an appointment and it won't be available for booking. Note that the table constraints don't enforce non-overlapping appointments. This is possible but it's more complicated. If this were my system I'd think about some system (e.g. trigger) to finally verify that the appointment doesn't overlap with an existing one at the time of insert, but that's up to you. 

You could deal with the issue by specifying the style and doing an explicit from string to datetime rather than an implicit conversion. $URL$ 

After the data is inserted, it counts how many rows in the table overlap the time range of the inserted row. If there are more than 1 (remember, the row has already been inserted so it will overlap) then the transaction is rolled back. 

This is probably not the sort of case where filtered indexes really shine - typically that is when the index represents only a small portion of rows in the table (like, a quarter or less) and in this case the filter predicate matches about three quarters of the table. That's not to say that you wouldn't get gains here, but it might be a bit of a tricky research project to get good designs. (Then again, indexing is always like that.) What about the current indexes on the table. Are they being used at the moment? Are they only being used in queries that have the predicate that you mentioned? If so, then it might be an easy win to convert some of your existing indexes to have a filter condition (instead of adding a new, filtered index). You probably already knew this, but filtered indexes won't be used by where the predicate that matches the filter uses a variable or parameter. $URL$
