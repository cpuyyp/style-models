At it's default settings, ntpd will refuse to make any large changes to the system clock, as it assumes something has gone wrong. To force a large NTP update, do the following: 

If the card does not show under the lspci command, you most likely have a dead PCIe slot. Do you have any other PCIe cards you can test in the slot? 

If the DHCP servers were added to the domain, then there will definitely be references to the domain after they have been removed from it. The only safe way to guarantee there is no AD data on the server is to wipe the disks and reinstall windows (though it may still be possible to get the data back with the use of data recovery software). 

This would give you a single PFX file that contains your all three of your CA's certificates, your certificate, and your private key. You can then upload it to Azure using the same process you used previously. 

Sounds like you need to include the intermediate certificates in the PFX you send to Azure. If you open PrimaryIntermediate.crt and SecondaryIntermediate.crt in a text editor and copy/paste the entire content into a single file called BothIntermediate.crt. The order the content is in doesn't matter, but make sure you include the headers ("-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----", etc.) and leave a blank line between the two. You'd then want to run something like this to do the PFX conversion: 

As these are both HP products, you should be able to find a sticker on each with a part number (probably labled p/n) that you can look up on the HP website to identify which is which. 

I am trying to set up SSH to a SCO Unix server that runs custom software that uses the function keys on the keyboard, however the keys do not appear to be in the correct format for SCO to recognise. None of the keyboard options on PuTTY work, including the SCO option. How do I change the keycodes that SCO/bash is looking for when it wants a function key? If it helps, the system is upgrading from Wyse50 terminals. thanks! 

There is a useful tool that test the different DNS nameservers available (your ISP, current configuration, DynDNS, Google Public DNS and other one). From my point of view Google DNS are pretty fast but depending on the load GoogleDNS supports my ISP Dns is sometimes faster. NameBench (Linux/Windows/Mac OS X) Output : alt text $URL$ 

Does anyone know how to solve this ? Is there any online DNSSEC tool that display more infos about the dnssec status ? 

Context I have two linux based servers which are remotely located. It has already happened twice: after a system or kernel update, the system wasn't responding/reachable over ssh anymore (configuration errors or disk failure, ...). I had travel to the location to rescue the server. When the boot process fails, the systems lands in the emergency/rescue shell which need to be administrated locally. Question: Is there a way or a feature of the bootloader to monitor the booting process (i.e. a watchdog), if the system is stuck after some time, a timeout triggers a the system reboot with a different image with network capabilities, ssh, ... (stored on a dedicated media, i.e USB key) in order to be administrated over ssh ? Thanks 

I don't know what's wrong... Apache has the right to read the passwd file. In addition if I comment the AuthDigest... lines and uncomment the Order and Allow, apache serves the folder like a charm. Apache responds me with a 403 and doesn't prompt my browser for user/pass .. Any help ? 

Apparently there is a bug in Apache 2.4.17. Disabling the module auto index (which is the cause of the wrong behaviour, will prevent the error. 

Since the last Fusion Passenger update, all my Sinatra applications have stopped working on the following env: Apache (2.4.17), Phusion Passenger (5.0.21). Everything was working as expected before updating the passenger middleware. The problem is, apache directory is trying to proceed to a listing of the public directory when I'm requesting the url ($URL$ of my vhost. The ODD part: If a route defined in the Sinatra controller is requested (i.e: $URL$ passenger is started and the requested page is served as expected. Here is the Virtual Host part: 

As I've got some experience installing the same on my Ubuntu machine, so I turned to following configuration files in order to set my MySQL credentials: 

It's in the case that I can connect to mysql server from the shell of the same machine using mysql client, with the same credential as given to Courier! How can this be possible? 

I've just setup my first virtual mailbox in Postfix. I wonder if it is possible to have two mailboxes on the same server, one virtual and one with shell account, within the same domain? 

To test, I've setup three VMs, one for load balancer and two for back-end webservers. Using hosts file I introduced three domains in all of the machines: 

The variable is supposed to contain the options passed to . It's missing which does what exactly I was looking for. According to its documentation: 

I would like not to register or assign a domain name (mycompany.com) or MX record for my local mail server. This mail server is not an open relay and its lonely responsibility is to connect to a singular remote mail server and I hope this requirement eliminates the necessity of a DNS. I've heard there are concerns regarding my emails to be labeled as spam if they are relayed this way. Which I definitely don't want it to happen. Perhaps one of most important points to make is security. What are the security issues in this scenario? And how should I tackle them? 

As you can see here, I'm waiting for two other services (RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL) before starting the current service. And it works. But the thing is that PostgreSQL does not provide an HTTP protocol and the only way I could manage to find if it is serving was to look for the in the response provided by program. I was wondering if there's a legitimate way to do this which works regardless of the protocol spoken on the port. And please remeber, I'm not looking for some big service which can orchestrate my whole network. I'm looking for a small program, like the ones named here, which can be found in a container and returns true once connection can be made on a remote port. 

I want to share file from my linux box to OSX clients. I don't want to use SMB ! I'm using netatalk 2.1.2 but apparently there is a filname length limitation : I've tried "123456789012345678901234567.avi" (31 characters long), and it works but when the filename is >31 char long. Some programs like Quicktime can't open the file. I've started the share with : 

Apache is trying to do directory listing (which has been disabled by configuration). Has someone experience the same issue ? How to make apache launch passager and serves the root of the Sinatra app ? 

Phusion will address the issue in the realase of Passenger 5.0.22 before Apache 2.5.0 will be released. 

Use the ServerPath like you want (doc in your example) and then use RewriteRule to bind the ServerPath to your new location. Don't forget the $1 (matched part). Don't forget to load mod_rewrite in apache. 

In common cPanel you can find the Simple DNS Zone Editor ! It allows you to enter Autoritative records for your domain name. Redirects mysubdomain.mydomain.net to 128.128.12.12 : alt text $URL$ 

I've seen you were using an alternative port for ssh so, replace the yyyy be the port the sshd deamon is running. Then restart fail2ban. 

You can't do this by indicating multiple the MX records for the same (sub)domain. The mail will be delivered to the server(s) defined by your MX record regardin only the (sub)domain, without any look at the user@... Mail routing is done on the (sub)domain part only. Possible solutions : 

you don't have to worry ! If you MAC address has really changed the only direct issues I can immagine are wireless authentication based on MAC Adresses. If so, go to te admin interface and update mac addresses you allow to join the network. May be you can also have dhcp / fixed ip issues. But if you don't use any of them, it's ok.
