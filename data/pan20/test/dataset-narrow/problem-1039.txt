Activate View → Panels → Places F9. Drag the icon from anywhere (URL bar, main viewport, folder structure) onto the Places panel. 

The font size in that application is eyestrainingly small for me to work with. How do I set it to a size of my choice? 

shows the remote addresses, but also the tty names. For my situation, this is preferable over netstat/ss because I can match the sessions much more quickly with the process list. 

I do not know which settings dialog you are talking about. KDE 4.5 gesture support does not take extra mouse buttons into account (long-standing bug). As a work-around, use to capture events from extra mouse buttons and to emit key combinations. The advantage is that this works at the X level, independent from KDE as desktop environment. The disadvantage is that if you decide to alter your keyboard combinations for copy/paste, you have to change the configuration file manually, too. 

Employ an extensible input method framework such as scim or ibus. The last one is possible out of the box by configuring the m17n backend, but I suspect the first two require you to program your input method. 

This looks like a non-standard notation for regular expressions, frequently abbreviated as regex or regexp. This is a tremendously important tool to learn if you do any serious text processing. As you have already understood, regex allow for powerful pattern matching and substitution. The notation you provided resembles the standard greatly, so I could recognise it. There is an industry standard, POSIX, and a de-facto standard, Perl regex. The next paragraph is boring history, skip it if you want. POSIX regex are used in many user-facing tools from POSIX-compliant operating systems (think Linux and its not-so-distant relatives). The canonical example is , which allows you to search for text in files. The text to match is specified in regex. Perl, a programming language, took the concept and extended it greatly for its purposes. Later a subset of this functionality was made it available as a code library, PCRE. All sorts of software embed this library, most notably text editors. I can see a few differences to what I am used to in the notation above. Word's symbol for symbol for escape sequences is , normally it is . »Only digits« is used often, so it has an abbreviation in Perl, namely is equivalent to the character class ; similarly, means word characters and is equivalent to . Word's notation appears cumbersome against it. I do not know the other limitations of Word, so I encourage you to switch to a text editor with PCRE support. You should learn first about whitespace matching (abbreviation ) and repetition ( and ). Perl's regex are explained in perlrequick, perlretut and perlre. To start experimenting right now, use the Flash based RegExr. 

It actually does work up to a certain degree. The goal of DRM is not to prevent a person to run/copy the software, but to make it more difficult and annoying to do so. If there isn't a crack yet then you will have to reverse engineer the protection mechanism and create one. Most people don't know how to do it, and most of the people who do find the process too annoying and prefer just paying for the software. If there is a crack, all the people who download it risk getting infected by a trojan or virus. The real world is full of protection mechanisms similar to DRM. For example in my city they sell a $50 device to pay parking fees: 

When I shut down my PC I usually have roughly 50 application instances open with unsaved pending changes, and roughly 100-150 that can be closed immediately. Before Windows 8 shutting down the PC started closing the applications and whenever it encountered one with a pending save it showed me the save dialog to which I had very little time to respond, after which I was forced to either terminate the process or abort the shutdown. The situation sucked, as I was forced to initiate the shutdown several times as I went through the dialogs. With Windows 8 things are even worse. As soon as you initiate the shutdown you are shown a useless screen where you can't do anything except see a list of the applications pending a save showing up as "Not Responding" and your only choices are to forcefully terminate them (without saving) or abort the shutdown. This leaves me manually closing all the open applications which is a very annoying and long process, taking up to 10 minutes. Is there a way to tell the PC to shut down which shuts down all apps without pending saves but lets me have a chance to respond to the save dialogs, shutting off the PC when I am done? 

The reason it gives such horrible estimates is that it's not well done. Obviously it can never be 100% precise but it could be much, much better. 

So using a short but difficult password is just counter-productive. It's more difficult to remember and less secure. Use a simple but long phrase. 

Any KDE application has the capability of loading and using a different icon than the built-in one on application start. Use the option. See the option for further customisations. 

in . When that configuration item is either removed, or the full path to the sudo binary is supplied, application styles and font settings work in YaST2, too. 

I have inherited about 2000 MP3 files. For the majority of them, their ID3 tags display garbled in Amarok. I need a software that upgrades the ID3 tags to v2.4 type (i.e. UTF-8 encoding), removes any v1 tags, and is also smart about figuring out the original encoding on a case-by-case basis (most likely one of Windows-1252, BOM-less UTF-16 or GB18030). Before I start programming this on my own on top of TagLib, is there already such a complete solution I could use? Do not recommend Musicbrainz – it is heavily biased to United States published music and near useless to me. Do not recommend general ID3 tagging software without testing it first against my requirements – most of them 

x11vnc is a different solution, instead of launching single applications over the tunnel, you remote attach to the remote existing desktop session and control it with the local input devices. Install on the remote computer, and enable . From the local computer, create a SSH tunnel: 

Browse the source. For KDE 4, it's kde-workspace/plasma/desktop/applets/kickoff/core/itemhandlers.cpp. 

Loss of pointer focus and window decoration are clear symptoms for a crash. Unlike other KDE applications, you will not get the crash manager. If you still have the term window open, you can attempt to revive it by copying/pasting the characters k, w, i, n and a newline with the mouse. When it crashes again, you will see the reason in the terminal. 

Perhaps you have some key redefining going on in your MPlayer settings? Move away and try again. Here's a work-around that aids you in debugging. Save your current working X keyboard layout to a file: Restore it any time: 

Run a VNC client on the local computer and connect to localhost, protocol VNC, port 5900, display 0 or the like. I can recommend KRDC. When you are done, close the VNC client, then kill the SSH session to tear town the tunnel. 

The default UA generation is hardcoded and you cannot adapt it without changing the source and recompiling. However, depending on what you attempt to do the following work-around may be acceptable. The site/domain specific UA filter matches domain names part-wise. The consequence is that you can enter a top-level domain name and the specified UA works for all sites in that domain, e.g. enter and pick and you will spoof Opera on all sites whose domain name ends in . Pick the most common TLD from the lists: $URL$ $URL$ 

I'd give handbrake a shot. It has worked great for most of what I've thrown at it. You may have to tweak settings, but the defaults should be a good starting point. The big thing to check is how it handles the audio stream. I've noticed that some of the defaults want to convert everything to stereo. It's easy enough to change, just check. 

get connected to Lion Server again failing that, a way to completely remove lion server so I can re-install Another place to look/check etc. so I can continue debugging, I'm a bit stuck at the moment. 

I'd really consider getting separate devices to handle the three different tasks. It costs a bit more now, but will save you money in the long run. With an all in one unit, upgrading one piece forces you to upgrade everything. I have a generic docsis 2.0 modem, a linksys 610n router (really nice dual radio that supports dd-wrt) and a generic linksys voip box. When I want to upgrade to a docsis 3.0 modem, I don't have to pay for a new router/voip box. (not to mention having to re-configure my router). In the end, being able to upgrade individual pieces rather than re-buy the whole thing is a plus (yet I'm still a Mac user, go figure) 

This is a case of not reading before doing. I wanted to start clean with Lion Server, so I did what I normally do, drag the app to the trashcan and re-install it. (not realizing that server was a bit more involved than most other applications) I'm now unable to connect to the server via Server.app. After I select the server and enter my username and password the connecting spinner spins forever. dtruss on both Server.app and servermgrd really didn't tell me much. I can connect to :311 with a web browser, so it appears that servermgrd is working to some extent. Things I've noticed: /etc/apache2.before-restore.... directories /etc/certificates.before-restore... directories /var/servermgrd/*.lock (with old dates) Anyone have a clue on how to: 

QoS is the right choice. I don't know about the D-Link software, but I know that dd-wrt handles this just fine. I don't know if it's available in the D-Link firmware, but you may be able to set your QoS stuff using a mac address rather than an IP. that way you would still be able to use automatic address assignment. The only reason I could think that would give you connection problems would be using a duplicate IP address. Try setting the static IP of your xbox to be on the upper end of your range. i.e. if your home network is numbered out of 192.68.1.0/24 space, try setting the xbox to be 192.168.1.200. This should take it out of the range of addresses normally used for DHCP. Someone will un-doubtedly complain that this is a gaming question. I think it's a networking question. 

You can achieve very high download speeds much much faster by increasing at the cost of higher bandwidth overhead. From personal experience I can say that changing that setting greatly improved download speeds, especially in the first few seconds/minutes after adding the torrent. It can be found in Preferences => Advanced. I have it set to 2000. This is most helpful in torrents that have a very large amount of seeds (more than 100) and the vast majority of them are not uploading or uploading at very low speed (your typical public bittorrent tracker). It is useless for torrents that have something like 30 seeds (but in that case it doesn't increase the bandwidth overhead either). 

Two years ago I bought a which never had a problem until recently, when the printed text started to appear "blurry". I printed the nozzle check pattern and this is the result: 

I think the reason was nicely explained in one of the comments of the blog post linked by Roald's answer: 

It is supposed to be a perfect grid with straight lines. As you can see, it's not (what's printed is blurred, the picture is not out of focus). If you click the image to view it not scaled down, you will notice that certain lines on the grid even split in two and then merge back together. On the left, where it says "PGBK", you can see what I mean by blurry text. All the other cartridges (C, M, Y and BK) do not have this problem. So far I tried: 

You probably inadvertently pressed ctrl shift '. This is a windows shortcut that affects some applications (examples include: mIRC, gtalk, wordpad, etc) and causes the behavior you are describing. Pressing the shortcut again or restarting the computer will disable it (and hence Dmnisih's answer is incorrect). 

When you activate it, it will display how much money you are paying per hour, and how much money you have left. When you run out of money you throw it away and buy a new one. That's a hardware device that is in your hands. By definition, it is absolutely possible to "hack" it so that you have infinite money. But hey, no one does it! So the "DRM" is working in this case. Other examples of DRM-like technologies are cash: you can in theory make fake bills that are exactly the same as real bills. It's just extremely difficult. And the list goes on: passports, IDs, etc. So the goal is not to make it impossible, it's to make it difficult, and in this case DRM does work.
