Marking as answered as this was discovered a long time ago through numerous lab setups and research. 

I've recently been studying the fundamentals on IPv6, but there are some things that I don't quite understand about how the addressing is structured. I know that link local addresses start with FE80, unique local addresses start with FC00 and global unicast addresses start with 2001 for example. Also from what I've seen, most addresses use the /64, sometimes accompanied by EUI-64. What I don't understand is the slash notation ranges with some of the address types. For example: Global Unicast 2000::/3 Link Local FE80::/10 Unique Local FC00::/7 With the above three address types for example, could someone please explain to me what the slash notations indicate? I can't seem to find a proper explanation for this anywhere. For the Global Unicast address for example, I've mostly seen 2001:0000 etc etc addresses. Does the notation mean the most I can go up to is 2003 as it's a /3?The same with the Link Local and Unique Local. The slash notations just don't make sense to me, and the books just don't seem to bring any logic to the table. I'm more than likely way off with my assumptions here, so some clarity would be good. I'd really like to understand this, rather than just assigning 2001:0000 etc etc Global Unicast addresses, without truly understanding why I'm doing it. Thanks in advance. 

As these switches are not related to eachother from a previous stack, how I do remove the switch provisioning for each switch? If I were to attempt to remove the setting, it comes to back to say that it can't be done whilst the switch is present. The first switch appears to be a master, with the other switch being the slave. Is there a config file that stores the settings for this? I've cleared the startup-configuration but this still remains. Would I have to connect them both with stacking cables to create a stack first before I can deactivate the setting? These switches will be used individually in the future, so this is why I want the stack removed altogether. Please advise. Thanks. 

The easy way is to plug a cable from ISR to EtherSwitch and the other Way is to create a BDI Interface on the ISR and Connect via VLAN to the Ethernet-Internal Port. But I cant create the config as shown in the forum Threads. On Cisco ISR I should create this config: 

Carrier 1 should access VLAN 600 as IPSEC Endpoint and access VLAN 525 behind but also access VLAN 525 without encryption. This is for SIP and RTP, only SIP Packet goes through the IPSEC Endpoint to Address in VLAN 525 and RTP goes direct to 525. Any Ideas about this? I'am right with my thoughts? 

On the ISR I configure a subdevice that works as IPSec Endpoint. Phase 1 comes up and the carrier confirm phase 1. Now I need to change my IP Route like that way for encryption: 

The EtherSwitch Module isn't a routing module, so you can't see the EtherSwitch Port if you connected to the ISR Router. You need to connect to the EtherSwitch module separate with following Command: 

Than I should add this VLAN to the interfaces on Catalyst and the Interface with VLAN 530 can access the VLAN 600 as IPSec endpoint and can route to VLAN 525 is this possible or do I have some wrong thinking? For explanation: 

While plug in a SM-X-ES3D-48-P Etherswitch Module into a Cisco ISR 4451 the Ports for this Module didn't came up. What I need to do to get the Ports enable with command? The Output of is: 

Originally I took this as one to one but when I tried it on a dual radio AP I was able to replace the Guest SSID on the 5Ghz radio: 

I forgot to include the user section but cisco/cisco is a temp account with privilege 15. Any ideas why SCP is failing when SSH works just fine? EDIT: SCP debug output 

From the data sheet on that router it looks like it supports PPTP for remote vpn. Any PPTP client should work, Windows has one built in. 

How do I resolve this issue without trying a reboot of the AP and risking it not booting due to a flash error? 

When installing the SRE-V software on one of my SRE modules in a Cisco 2911, it keeps failing to download the final files after loading the Linux kernel. These are the interface configs from the router: 

Cisco won't allow more than one SSID per VLAN per Interface using Autonomous APs. Can't answer for WLCs, but I would assume the same thing. If you have a single radio AP, I recommend having a test VLAN to go with the test SSID and then have your router route between the VLANs. AP Message When Attempting: 

Then make sure you have on. Also the gateway for PC A should be while the gateway for PC B should be . The subnet mask should be not the gateway. Once fixed, make sure you can ping the gateway of each PC from the respective PCs as well. 

I try to add to the nexus config but the command is unavailable. Maybe this is the issue of my config. The Server attached to the Eth1/16 Port is configured with IP 10.1.1.50/28 and the IP 10.1.1.49 or 10.1.1.51 is not accessible from that server. 

In the docu for this module I can't find a way to activate this 48 Ports and sh ip int br Command didn't show the Ports. What can I do? 

I try to create a Vlan that route traffic through multiple Cisco Devices. For that I create a vlan13 on each device and setup a IP on the ISR and the Device attached to the Nexus also have a IP on the same subnet. 

From a PC that is attached to a Cisco Catalyst 3850 and Portchanneld to Cisco ISR I do a ping to a destination that is connected with BGP. That works for me. The trace path looks like: 

Maybe I need a static route that says destination Network via IPSec subdevice and then to BGP Neigbhour? How can I do that? I try to add a static route but doesn't work: 

On a Cisco isr 4451 with base image I need to check if IPSec is available. Is there an command to list available vpn features? UPDATE The image name includes K9 (UNIVERSALK9-M) but the command failed as invalid input detected at isakmp. How can I enable IPSEC on K9 Image. UPDATE As mentioned here is the output of sh license 

I feel that I've done everything I can here with the USB stick. Is there specific software that I need to use to prepare a USB stick for the boot loader? I've tried diskpart and also Rufus, but it just seems to be the boot loader that doesn't like anything I've tried. Please adivse. Thanks. 

Recently, I've been working on two spare switches which I need to stack at some point, but before I did that I needed the clear the config on both switches. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of typing erase flash: instead of nvram: and it's obviously caused me a problem. Not a massive issue though as I could just load the IOS image of the other switch as they're both 2960x switches. I've taken a USB drive and partitioned it to 2GB and formatted it as FAT16. When loading the USB onto the working switch, it accepts it without issues and allows me to copy the IOS image to usbflash0: and when doing a dir usbflash0:, it shows me the IOS image so I know it's all ready to go. When I console into the switch that does not have an IOS image, it takes me to the boot loader which is expected. However, it's at this point that usbflash0: is not recognised, and displays the following: 

Is there something wrong with my config that's causing this? EDIT: On both interfaces from the core and the access stack, there is a stationary amber light which usually indicates STP has suspended the port to avoid a loop. Port Channel 1 (Access Stack) 

Otherwise the VPN traffic will bypass the ACLs. However you can use a VPN filter instead of placing ACLs on the interface and avoid turning off the option. Example may be found here: $URL$ 

Depending on the ASA and license you have, you could use contexts which create virtual ASAs within the ASA. Each is independent of the other. This would also allow you to test ASA configs before putting them on production. Each vlan interface is assigned to a context. Packets coming in are classified (in your situation, via MAC of the vlan interface) and then sent to their respective context. Another option would be to have 3 routers, one per vlan, performing NAT to a central subnet that the ASA is on. 

My company won't put up the money for WLCs. So we run all autonomous APs. Haven't had any issues. We use 1-10 APs per site, same SSIDs (4-6 per site, all APs run all the SSIDs for the site). Users haven't had any issues roaming between them. I'm sure there are reasons for using a WLC (rogue AP detection, frequency selection, better mesh/roaming), but as long as things work for us, management won't give me the budget to implement them. The only bullet point I could use was managing so many APs globally used to be a pain but I resolved that with autobooting them off a TFTP config that I update. Single config for all APs. 

For a ISR4451 there is a SM-D-ES3G-48-P Module, is this module hotplugable or should I power down the ISR for install the SM Module? UPDATE 

In a Cisco ISR 4451 we install a EtherSwitch 48 Port Module. The ISR is working and the EtherSwitch Module too. Now I want to create a route from ISR to EtherSwitch and read some Manuals and Forum threads how to do that. 

But ios told me that is invalid because it's this router. The issue is that the Port where the PC is connected only accept decrypted traffic but one customer wants to use a IPSec Tunnel for encryption. So the ISR should be the endpoint, decrypt the traffic and send it decrypted to the PC1 Port. For explanation see this Visio chart: 

While plugin a SM-D-ES3G-48-P into a ISR4451 the SM module didn't come up. What steps are needed to setup this SM into the ISR4451. Google only show me install documents for Catalyst Switches. Anyone can show me the steps for a ISR 4451? 

For the Po1.530 and Po1.531 there are active BGP Sessions, this sessions can connect to Po1.525 now I want to create a Interface only for IPSEC Endpoint so that Po1.530 can access the Po1.525 plain and if needed access a subnet for example 10.10.1.37 as IPSEC Endpoint. 

I try to setup a Cisco ISR Router 4451 as IPSEC Endpoint. We do have serval Interfaces Connected as Portchannel VLANs from a Cisco Catalyst 3850 Stack and setup a BGP Session for each Connection. Also connected a subnet with our machines connected as Portchannel VLAN to the ISR. Now I want to create a IPSEC Endpoint that is accessible from one connected BGP Session and terminate to our subnet. But not for all the BGP Connection just for one.
