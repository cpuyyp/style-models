If everything goes well and the line is good, you will see four replies for every ICMP package: your packages are duplicated on the local side, and the replies to these two packages are duplicated again on the remote side. This will not be an issue for TCP connections, because TCP will simply ignore all duplicates. This is an issue for UDP packets, as it's up to the software to handle duplicates. For example, a DNS query will yield four replies instead of the expected two (and use four times the normal bandwidth for the response instead of two times): 

Create a /etc/openvpn/tap-up.sh script (and don't forget to mark it executable with chmod a+x tap-up.sh): 

Don't forget to edit /etc/defaults/openvpn to make sure your new VPN configurations are started. Reboot you machines, or load rc.local and restart openvpn manually. Now you're ready to test your setup: 

I used the answer provided by @user48116 and it works like a charm. The setup is actually quite easy! NOTE: I implemented this with two connections to just one single server, as this already solved the problem for me. If you want to try a setup with two servers, the easiest way is probably to use port forwarding to forward the UDP port from the second server to the first, and use the same recipe as described here. I have not tested this myself though. First, make sure you have a 2.6 kernel with bonding support (default in all modern distributions) and you have ifenslave installed. Next, put this into your /etc/rc.local or any other place you prefer, but make sure it's run before openvpn is started (because it will try to bind to bond0): Client: 

None of those appear to have made any difference. The really frustrating thing is that neither Sharepoint's logs ( set to Verbose and my god to they mean that ) nor the system Event Log seem to give any indication of a problem, they just don't do anything. Is there an obvious problem here and if not, is there an easy way I can break things down a little to figure out where in the process it is failing? 

I have some problem with the .net runtime since installing some recent sharepoint fixes but as I can't see anyone else having had this problem I think it may be coincidental and the runtime just needs repairing. So, I do the usual thing, open Add/Remove Programs find Microsoft .NET framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and click on "Click here for support information" whereupon I get the version information and a Repair button. Clicking on Repair asks for the whereabouts of "netfx20a_x86.msi" which I don't have on my system, so I can't repair it. I download the .Net 2.0 SP2 distributable installer executable from Microsoft, use the /T command line to open it up so that I can see the files and sure enough there is the netfx20a_x86.msi installer a few directories in. So I go back to my Repair option and provide the path to the msi file. After a brief moment i get an alert box saying "to install this product please run setup.exe" which is nice, but I don't want to install it. Still, I make the effort and go back to run setup.exe. I get a message informing me that this product is already installed on this machine and if I want to repair it I need to use the "Repair" option from Add/Remove Programs. What next? 

We have installed Vmware ESXi v6 u3 on a DL380 G9. We did the raid in the Intelligent provisioning during system startup, after which we did the Install. But all the volumes created are showing up as . Is there any reason for this. 

I have connected to nic adapters a standard vSwitch, and have enable 'Route based on an IP hash' on the vSwitch. For the physical switch we are using a cisco switch and have enabled LACP with nic teaming on two ports. Now when we connect, the host stops responding. To bring it back I need to change the port on the physical switch. What could we be doing wrong. 

It seems like the Get-Process isn't working on Windows Embedded Standard. Is there any other way of doing this. 

I'm trying to do a GPU passthrough to a vm (2008 64bit r2) ESXI 6.0.3. After the GPU passthrough and installing the NVidia drivers. I have disabled the VMWARE SVGA. Now in the device manager it shows only the Quadro M4000 enabled with the VMWARE Svga disable. My console view, and vnc is working fine. But I don't have any output on the back of the display ports. The display ports show me black. To do this I did the following: I did a GPU passthrough on the ESXI. THen installed the VM. passed VM the PCI card. Then installed the drivers in the VM. Connected a screen to port 1 and ran the Nvidia Control panel. From the control panel in the System Topology I exported the EDID. Then loaded the edid of the connected port. It showed me the TV icon on the connected port in the GUI. Then I made the External screen as my main display. Disabled the VMWARE SVGA. After this I restarted the VM. MY VM console screen is working, VNC is working fine and in the device manager I can see VMWARE Svga to be disabled with Nvidia card enabled. Now if I put a screen on the display ports it shows me black. Is this normal. Is the GPU passthrough done properly. 

I'm having a really difficult time trying to get my Sharepoint site to use Forms Authentication. I've tried using an ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvder and the LDAP equivalent but both of them seem absolutely unable to find any users from ActiveDirectory in any of the "peoplefinder" type of areas. In Web.config for the admin section I have this: 

For some reason VMWare ESXi has decided that one of my VMs is on a completely different path to the path it is actually on. So my VM is on /vmfs/volumes/long-guid-here/my-vm-name but when I try to open it I get the message "File < unspecified filename> was not found." Which is not really surprising as unspecified filenames are quite difficult to locate. I thought it was just the swap file, which was down in the .vmx file as /vmfs/volumes/long-guid-here/old-vm-name/old-vm-name.vmsd but when I changed that in the vmx it made no difference. What I can't figure out is where VMWare is getting the old-vm-name from- when I look in the "Settings" pane it believes the working file location to be "[datastore-name] old-vm-name\" and I can't find anywhere to change it. Now the files themselves are all named for old-vm-name - so the directory is /my-vm-name/old-vm-name.vmx and so on. Is this the cause of my problems or is there some arcane configuration option elsewhere around the VMWare machine that I need to be tinkering with?
