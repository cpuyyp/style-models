I have a ws-C2960XR-24ps-I switch with 2 slots for power supply's but only 1 power supply inserted. So the switch is always logging an event : "%PLATFORM_ENV-1-FRU_PS_ACCESS: FRU Power Supply is not responding". When I try to disable it by running I get "power supply is not present" in response. Is there a way to disable that slot so it stops sending these log messages that there is a missing power supply? 

When you set your aging parameters you have several options, you can have it based on time, or type, or statically set: 

I have 4 branches each with a 10mbps WAN connection to HQ. HQ has a 30Mbps WAN connection. I need to deploy QoS over the WAN with a 5 class model. 

Ok I believe I found the problem. My remote sites have their own routers with their own internet connection. We don,t really use it for anything other than an IPSEC tunnel back to HQ to use as a backup WAN link.. I use EIGRP to build my route tables, so these routers at my remote sites happen to not have a static default route. So anytime their public IP is pinged, scanned, and so forth, the replies are going out using the default route learned by EIGRP, which goes over our WAN line to my CORE switch then out to the internet through my ASA firewall. As soon as I add a static default route at each remote site the problem, so far, goes away. 

I know static NAT and dynamic NAT can run simultaneously on the same outside interface. I'm looking for a way to configure both NAPT and Dynamic NAT on the same outside interface. The inside network is 172.20.10.0/24 on Fa0/1 The outside network is 10.0.0.1/28 on Fa0/0 I have 10 outside global IP's in an NAT pool 10.0.0.3 - 10.0.0.13 for 10 specific inside local hosts. I have 1 outside global IP that I would like to use NAPT for all other inside local hosts. Is this possible? or is it easier to do a static NAT for the 10 inside local IP's and NAPT for all other inside local hosts? This is on a Cisco 1841 IOS 15.1 

The tunnel source interface needs to have VRF forwarding enabled You need under the tunnel, to instruct the tunnel to use the specified VRF 

Now, SW2 will be the winner of the election process, and it wins due to the lower extended system id. Hence the answer to your question is: yes, it could possibly affect root bridge election. The lowest possible VLAN number is 1, and the default MST instance is 0, resulting in the MST switch always winning root election with default settings. Also please have a look at Benjamins comment about spanning interoperability. I am currently not sure about the behavior (on BPDU sending level) when MSTP and PVSTP+ have to work together. I will add detailed information later, I have to try that in lab and inspect the BPDUs. If you think about that for a minute, that makes perfect sense. MST + RPVSTP interoperability requires the root bridge to be within the MST domain. Sure you can manually tweak the priority, in which case you messed that up yourself. By default however, the switch in the MST domain will be selected as root bridge. TL;DR and Summary: If all switches are running (R)PVSTP or all switches are running MSTP, then no, it will not affect root bridge election. In a mixed environment, it certainly can. One note, though: this discussion is certainly true for Cisco switches (more general, switches supporting per VLAN spanning tree), but not necessarily for other switches. 

After all, its for CCNA-level study. So the short answer is: No you cannot. You could use GNS3 or Cisco VIRL to experiment with that topic. 

The answer is simply "no". As Ricky already told, the 5505 has an integrated switch built-in, hence you can create VLAN interfaces (which are then routed interfaces actually visible to the firewall). The larger ASA devices (honestly, I think all other Cisco firewalls except for the your old 5505) do not have such a switch built-in. While you can configure sub-interfaces and use different VLANs on the same port (802.1q trunking), you cannot assign one VLAN on multiple ports. This is what a switch does, but the ASA cannot do that. For a more detailed advice we would need more details about your network, such as why you need to have multiple ports with the same VLAN and what is connected to which interface. From what I see in your configuration, it seems that you simply connect multiple clients to the firewall. If this is the case: use any VLAN capable switch, connect it to your new ASA (either via one physical interface using 802.1q or multiple physical interfaces) and let both your ASA and the switch do what they were designed for. 

You probably will want to look into port-security sticky (dynamically learns the MAC) then configure aging to age out old MAC Addresses on each interface. You wont be able to have port security configured and at the same time allow a MAC to move from interface to interface without problems. As stated above, it defeats the purpose of port-security. For each interface you can configure it to dynamically learn the mac with: 

I have a Cisco ASA that gives me some sylogs that I do not understand. My INSIDE interface is where all my private IP addresses reside for the enterprise i work for. My OUTSIDE interface is what has my public IP address block assigned to it. I often see the following logs which I do not understand, a routable IP address is being sourced on the INSIDE interface with a destination to another routable public IP on the OUTSIDE interface. Any ideas? None of the IP addresses on these logs belong to me or are assign to any of my devices. 

I just want the specific log to stop without keeping it from logging any issues with the slot that is in use. 

EDITED: ADDED FULL ROUTER CONFIG I have a cisco 2921. It uses EIGRP to learn its routing table and has no static default routes set up. I would like to keep it that way. The default route (learned from EIGRP) is another device on my network across a Metro ENS link. When this particular router receives traffic from host 192.168.2.5 I want it to be given a default route out this routers ISP connection (3.3.3.1). It is not working, does anyone know why this route map does not work? The traffic from my host arrives at Interface GigabitEthernet0/1. I want it to go out Interface GigabitEthernet0/0 using the ISP ( the IP in the route-map is the default gateway my ISP has provided). Interface gi0/0 also has a vpn tunnel configured to my main site, its more of a backup link but I do not see this as being a problem (or is it?). I have verified that the access list on interface gig0/0 is not blocking any traffic for this host. I ran and and nothing comes up. This tells me that whenever I try to access this device from the internet it is not hitting interface gi0/1 at all. I can see the traffic hitting gig0/0, but never gig0/1. Perhaps I have a NAT issue? 

I am tasked to do conditonally advertise a default route using RIP only if a specific IP address is ICMP reachable. (Yes, CCIE study, not a real network design). My idea was to use the track object matching feature to accomplish this task: 

The packets do actually arrive at the router. I am sending ~140Mbit/s traffic stream, and SMTP counters show the following (read using SNMP): 

Both of them are reachable (the first one even in the same subnet), as can be also seen at the delay / jitter values. Interestingly the offset differs quite significant looking at both time servers. The offset however is roughly correct, slightly more than 2 minutes. As I do not have access to the root shell, I cannot use ntpq as indicated by this tech note. Additionally, as far as I know, none of both sersers is a Microsoft NTP. Update1 Just to make sure it is not an NTP server issue, I configured one of our Cisco routers as NTP server, which itself uses 146.140.66.230. ISE recognizes it as stratum 4 server, but does not choose it as time source. Any hints how to tackle this one? 

In my lab network I have a Juniper MX 80 configured as MPLS router. On one site there is a customer connected (simulated by a single PC) and on the other side is an MPLS network. I use tcpreplay to generate traffic load. The PCAP file I use has been prepared as follows: 

Sure, this is possible, depending on the router model and software. OSPFv2 is for IPv4 only and OSPFv3 for both IPv4 and IPv6. There are however differences in the implementation of both protocols (as these are two completely independent protocols), depending on the vendor and sometimes even on the model. Consider Cisco for example: In regular IOS and IOS-XE, you can run both protocols at the same time, even for IPv4. Note however, when running both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for IPv4, routes learned via OSPFv2 will always take precedence, ignoring "normal" OSPF route selection rules, which are only evaluated within a process. On IOS-XR, for example, OSPFv3 is not even supported for AF IPv4, only for IPv6. 

Here is my question/confusion. On the HQ WAN side I have a 30mbps pipe available, on each branch WAN side I have a 10mbps pipe. What would be the best way to QOS this traffic? I would like to focus on outbound traffic from each site. Im thinking that on each branch WAN egress I can use srr-queue bandwidth limit XX as well as on the egress of the HQ WAN link. This would set a limit on the available bandwidth. However, since the 3750 & 3650 do not support policy-maps on the outbound traffic, I am not sure if my only option is to used srr shape and share and add dscp values (which would be classified & marked with respective ACLs, Class Maps) to each queue set. Then set my bandwidth and buffers for the thresholds. I tried by configuring policy maps on the input but the results were not what I expected. I also could not understand the point of limiting input traffic since it has already arrived. 

So I thought I knew how to set up my DHCP Server on my 3550 switch and reserve IP's for clients. I go into the pool I need to reserve the IP in, but I do not have the address command as an option to do it like I have in the past on IOS. 

I have an ASA I set up for a non profit org which is not passing traffic. Packet tracer gives me mixed results depending on where the traffic is coming from, the two results are that the traffic is being dropped by an ACL and the other that it is a NAT issue. Im sure its something obvious that im missing. I can get to certain sites like youtube and google drive but not others such as dropbox or gmail. They stream live to youtube without issues as well. Im inclining towards it being a problem with traffic getting back in from the outside interface to the inside interface. Here is the current config. 

This however does not work (no default route is advertised). Preferred solution is to use a dummy static route like this which is actually working. 

Obviously SW1 will become root. Suppose now, SW2 was changed to MST mode and SW1 is still running RSTP. MSTP is fully backwards compatible to other spanning tree protocols. With MSTP, the extended system is becomes the MST instance number, as it would make no sense to use the VLAN here. Many VLANs can be mapped to a single instance. Just enabling MSTP without any configuration will create the MST instance 0 (!) and map all VLANs to it. Now the bridge IDs would look as follows: 

Benjamin Dales answer is certainly correct for switches running standards based spanning tree. For switches using per VLAN STP however: yes, it can very well make a difference. Granted, under rather specific circumstances. As you said, the bridge-id is basically made up of three parts: , where the MAC address is just appended. The lowest bridge IDs wins the root bridge election. That being said, it is obvious that the priority must be the same on all routers in order for the extended system ID to actually make a difference. Suppose a network just consisting of two switches. SW1 has a MAC address of 1 (just going to short that up here, suppose those were actually 48bit MAC addresses), SW2 has the MAC address 2. Both use the default priority (32768). When running only PVSTP (no matter if rapid or not), the VLAN ID of that instance is used as extended system ID. In that case (for the sake of that example we're running in VLAN 1), the bridge IDs would be 

Like Ron says in his response, you will want to have port-security to dynamically learn (sticky) the MAC addresses, possible set a max amount to learn on each interface, and configure the aging parameters to what best suits you. 

Okay so this is one of those times when you should always verify your network map even if you are pretty confident it is correct. The jack on the wall at my desk that I was connecting the switch to was passing through an old Dell switch hidden away on a rack. The Dell switch was only passing untagged traffic so this is the reason Span tree was not working. This is why when I would run my debugs on both ends I could see the BPDU's leaving each switch but neither Cisco switch would recieve any BPDU's from each other. As soon as I ripped that old dell out of the server room and threw it away, everything works. I suppose this is why we have an OSI model for troubleshooting, always start at layer 1 and always verify even if someone swears the network map is correct. 

I used ip default next-hop because I want it to look at the routing table first (for internal communications to DNS, AD, local access) and then as a last resort use this route to get out to the internet. For testing, i add a static route 0.0.0.0/0 ab.ac.ab.ax and everything works great. But i do not want any of my other devices that send traffic through this router to know there is a way out to the internet. I only want this specific host to be able to use this local ISP link. This is why i am using PBR. Everything else that hits this router will go out the configured vpn tunnel on gi0/0 to another location. 

Find out the user's MAC address. There are multiple ways to do that, but possibly you have an IP Address Management (IPAM) system or you can find it out using the IP address. On the switch or router being the layer 3 gateway of the user's VLAN, try to ping the end PC. It does not matter if it answers or not, the device should however ARP for the MAC address of the user's device, which you can find out using , which should give you the MAC address. The next step is to track the path of this MAC address using the layer 2 forwarding information of each switch. Use which will give you the entry in the MAC address table including the outgoing interface of this entry. Find out which switch is connected to this port for example using CDP. 

According to my knowledge, both of them are internal routes (received from an iBGP peer) and both are not synchronized. Hence they should not be considered as candidate for best path and R1 should not advertise that path any further. However, as seen before, it has still selected path #2 as best and advertises the path further to other RR-clients, for example to R4: 

The basic switching functionality will be there right away. This means normally all ports are enabled and assigned to the same default VLAN (usually 1). Further, usually there is Spanning Tree active by default. So long story short: You can use the switch right out of the box, you however have the possibility to add and configure other features (for example VLANs, basic routing, security features, or other things) as required.
