Yes a RCA to USB adapter would work. But before buying one email the manufacturer and see if they have Linux support and more specifically do they have Debian Arm drivers. It will be pointless buying an adapter that has no driver. I have seen people record video from USB cameras though so it is possible. 

As far as I understand it, your RPi (if you updated it successfully) should now have use of all 512mb's. For curiosity sake, maybe also run the following command. Which will make sure that our RPi is updated (NOTE: This will update all installed apps as well) 

The comments on the original post are getting too long, so here is my answer. I suspect that it's the drive itself. Maybe try update your Raspberry Pi and then try again. To update sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade Then try to access the drive. If this does still not work. I'd recommend trying to find someone with a HDD at least the same size or bigger and test that. 

RPI-Update is used to update the Raspberry Pi to the latest version. You don't really need it, but it is a good idea to keep the Raspberry Pi updated. So you might as well install rpi-update. Also if you don't really need your Raspberry Pi on the latest bleeding edge updates. Rather use the following command. This will update all installed packages to their stable current version 

If the packages are found, then install them. Normally it will ask you for a Y/n response. If the packages are not found, then search the internet for "debian install [name]". Shout if you run into issues, will try help you out. 

The memory is essentially impossible to upgrade, well unless of course you'd like to de solder the RAM from the SOC. The memory is part of the SOC so you cannot change the memory without changing the CPU and GPU (The whole SOC). In terms of USB you can technically hook up 127 devices per USB port. Using the USB ports you could also add more storage to your Raspberry Pi. Also the Raspberry Pi foundation are also working on a camera that can be plugged into the RPi. Into one of the header ports, not using the USB ports. Also I suppose you could use the GPIO pins to add just about anything to the RPi. 

Additionally as posted in the thread. The only reason for changing the serial would be to copy someone else's MP4 licence and use it. As that is the security around the licensing. Your unique serial is linked to the MP4 licence, so even if someone got your licence key, they will be unable to do anything with it (unless they could change the Raspberry Pi's serial number. UPDATE: To answer the actual question. I'd say that as Dom has the source for the actual low level firmware. I'd imagine that he is really just changing the source code that reads the serial and forcing it to return a different value. I honestly doubt that it was actually changed (on the CPU I mean), more like he changed some of the firmware code to return a different serial. Also apologies to the asker, we all just gave you a "Why? Thats not nice. Your stealing" instead of answering the question. My bad. 

Try other values: 0 is NTSC, 1 is Japanese NTSC, 2 is PAL, 3 is Brazilian PAL. I'm not 100% sure that this will actually work, considering you said that it used to work and now doesn't. But hey it's worth a shot. 

Once you have XBMC installed on your Raspberry Pi. It should be a simple matter of using XBMC to navigate to your external HDD and playing the files. To answer your question though. Yes it is possible and quite a popular use for the Raspberry Pi. The easiest way to install XBMC is to use one of the modified distro's. Raspbmc is a popular option and so is OpenELEC. Raspbmc is easier to install (my honest opinion) 

Yes. Just replace filename with start.sh. It's like a collection of files. These files are run when changing run levels. Almost like the "startup" folder in Windows, all the files will run everytime a run level is changed. But it's mostly used to run files on startup, which is technically "changing" a run level. Think of it as a pool of files that will be run at startup, files can be removed as well. If you mean that you dont want to move the start.sh file. Then rather use the following command to make the file run at startup update-rc.d start.sh defaults 

Firstly regarding your concern about "Shared hosting not being all that reliable". I'm not sure what country your from, but who is to say that your internet connection to your Raspberry Pi is all that reliable. Shared hosting is pretty reliable, probably more than your internet connection. Secondly it depends on what exactly you want control over. Storing the data on the Raspberry Pi is better as you'll have control over everything, you'll also then know how to setup PHP and MySQL on your Raspberry Pi. These will impact the RPi's performance, but much less than you probably think. In terms of cost, the least would be to do everything on your RPi. But that depends on how long it takes for you to set everything up. Personally I'd do everything on the RPi itself, so that it is more a self-contained solution. 

This is a nice guide on exactly how to setup Ruby on Rails. Obviously using the RPI. I think it would be pointless to copy and paste the whole article here, so here is a google cached version of the above page as well. Google Cache Ruby on Rails 

Your most likely using TightVNC and it's behaviour does not allow access to the real (to my knowledge) x desktop session. What your looking for is x11vnc. This allows VNC access to the default X session. Not exactly sure what Distro you are running, but first try installing it . If that does not work, then you will have to download the source and compile it on the Raspberry Pi. Just a side note: You cannot "see" any output that comes from the GPU IE: Video, games. That output is only sent over the HDMI cable for now (This will be changed sometime in the future) UPDATE VNC GPU OUTPUT: VNC on the new Raspbian has an experimental direct capture mode. Note that the documentation says that you need to enable this setting, however my recent install of Raspbian had the setting enabled by default. On your Raspberry Pi, open the VNC Server dialog(top right of screen) -> Navigate to Menu > Options > Troubleshooting and select Enable experimental direct capture mode. 

You say that it seems to run quite happy. I'm with @ikku on this. It may not "feel natural", but it works. I'd personally run it for a few days. Maybe maxing it out, by running Quake 3 or OpenArena for a few days. Just have them constantly loop. I have seen setups like yours run without issue. I woudnt say there is much of a concern. But I'll completely understand if you play OpenArena for a few hours in the name of "testing" ;) 

Here is a list of verified to be working Wi-Fi dongles. It seems that this one is quite popular and should be what you need. Although maybe see what dongles you can actually get locally and see if any of those are on the list. Also check which dongles work out of the box, as that will make everything much easier. 

Maybe what your looking for is ArchLinux, here is the Raspberry Pi Download. Arch Linux is a very simple "uncluttered" distro for Linux. Might be a starting point for what you want. You can also maybe start with Arch Linux and strip it down further. Other than that as the other answer says, it will take less time to just strip down a current distro. I know this is not Linux, but if your really feeling like a big project you can always code your own OS for your Raspberry Pi. 

Also have you tried running and seeing if you can adjust the memory split there? (I dont have a 512 RPi, but I remember someone saying that raspi-config knew how to tell the difference) 

You can use the built in screen saver that comes with XBMC. The options are all in . Although there is a way to actually switch off HDMI, I think that would kill sound and video. The screensaver will only kick in if video is not being played. Although not having my RPi with me right now, I cant test this. But I'm fairly sure. Here are the settings and what they mean, there are also some workarounds there. Screensaver time 

But I think for this to actually work, you will need to compile a custom kernel. So replace your with your custom one, which has the L2 cache disabled. Also have a look at berryboot which allows you to install different versions of the same Linux on your SD card. 

In the tutorial you posted. The poster says that he is using version 7.2.1 of Netbeans. Have you tried using his version? Sometimes a small change between versions will break something. Give version 7.2.1 a shot.. 

This should be 2 questions. I will answer your question about your Raspberry Pi not booting unless the HDMI cable is plugged in. This seems to be a bug in the firmware. Although it does seem to be fixed in a newer firmware update. Have you tried running ? Or if you dont have rpi-update, try the following terminal command. Just a note will make your RPi more up to date than the following command. 

Basically you cannot currently get the GPU usage. You can only get the CPU usage, try the command. Regarding the optimum CPU/GPU split. It really depends on what you are using your RPi for. If your not playing videos and games (GPU optimized), then give the CPU the most amount of RAM. Also if your running "headless" then assign the CPU as much RAM as you can. Chromium does not currently use the GPU, check the following thread. It's from one of the guys doing the development of Chromium for the Raspberry Pi. Also there are some tips on how to get Chromium to run faster in the original post. 

With Raspbian, ssh is enabled by default the last time I checked. So yes you should be able ssh into the RPi provided that port 22 is not blocked. IE: You should be able to ssh into the RPi from your internal LAN. As a side note, you might want to buy a HDMI to DVI converter cable. Just in case you ever need to plug your RPi into a screen. You know, to jam some Quake 3. 

Regarding VLC playback, the current VLC needs to be re-compiled and the source slightly changed so that it uses the RPi GPU properly. Currently VLC tries to use the CPU to play the video, which plays the video back very slowly, if at all. I haven't personally tried playing a Bluray disc, but it's my understanding that Linux cannot play Bluray discs (apparently something to do with the encryption). The following thread might be of interest. Essentially. The Sony will have to give up their patent on Bluray in order for the encryption to work on Linux. I don't think Linux will ever (never say never) have Bluray disc support. Also the following post a guy tests exactly what you want to do. Although this post says that once you removed the copy protection and copied that onto another disc, it played back Bluray fine (do note, without encryption though). The post says that it was not possible to play back the original Bluray disc. 

Well someone would have to change the source code of VirtualGL/TurboVNC to use the Raspberry Pi's GPU. There are some projects floating around on the Raspberry Pi Forums. Currently it's not possible, unless someone changes the source code. Normal VNC use If you just want to use normal VNC, as suggested in the first comment, then you can just use TightVNC. Here is a guide on how to get TightVNC working on a Raspberry Pi, do note though that you will not be able to use VNC to see anything being rendered by the GPU IE: Video playback, GPU games (Quake 3, PenguinPuzzle). Just thought I might add this section based on the first comment. 

Tell us where your encountering a problem. Try flesh out the question as much as possible. Help us help you. Are you having a issue with the configuration? Is it not showing the picture? Can you not install ? 

You could try testing some other sdtv values in the config.txt file. Try adding the following line to the file 

Realistically the easiest solution is to download the image again from the Raspberry Pi website and copy the image to the SD card again. Most likely some files made it across and some did not. 

Well if you get the issue on the RPi itslef then, it seems that you might be the victim of the SD card corruption saga. Run the following commands on the RPi itself. After modifying the file. Run the following command.
