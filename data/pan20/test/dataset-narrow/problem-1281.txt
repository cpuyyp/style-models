You likely want to start with something simpler than creating a game if you get stuck at loops. Here's the basic idea for creating a grid, you pretty much have everything you need. 

I can't imagine how your code would produce the image you linked. I could however, imagine how it might produce an image like this: 

What aspects should I take into consideration for creating character animation and rendering classes if I want to be able to have detachable limbs? I've developed a detailed body system that can have everything down to the nervous system defined. I'm aiming for something similar to the level of damage detail found in Dwarf Fortress. For example, when a character takes damage to their upper arm, there is a chance of nerve damage that can disable the entire arm. Or they could lose the arm entirely. I have a system written up for handling the data part of this. Each character has a trunk, which has appendages and internal parts. Each appendage can also have child appendages and internal parts. Child appendages are disabled/removed if a parent appendage is disabled/removed. If any of the disabled/removed appendages or internal parts are required for life, the character will soon die. What I'm working on now is the drawing/animation portion of this. How do I define animations to know which ones are allowed given the current state of the body (missing arms/legs and so on)? How do I set up the drawing system to not draw missing limbs? Does each limb/appendage have to be its own model (I'd like to draw cut off appendages on the ground)? The simple system I'm transitioning from (I just wrote it for testing) imports all the key frames of an animation as full models into a VBO (along with vertex counts for where key frames start/stop). It doesn't import or utilize the bones defined in Blender, and it doesn't interpolate between frames. This is likely a pretty big question, so I'm also looking for resources that can get me where I need to go. EDIT I ask about the animation knowing which limbs it's animating because I would like to have it set up to perform an alternate animation if a required limb is missing. After thinking about that, I imagine I would perform that check before activating an animation, and activate the appropriate animation at that time. 

I'm not sure if there's any technical reason, but a large portion of the world reads from left to right (and many early games were made in the portions that do, i.e. Pitfall!). So starting left and going right may seem more natural. Once enough of the early games did this, it became standard practice. Additionally, it could be from the roots of design. If these games were first designed with paper and pencils, it would feel more natural to go from left to right, as that's the way the designers were used to writing. So I suppose by continuing to do this, developers do gain something. Player familiarity. The likely history behind this would go as follows: 

Your problem is not with the NavMesh. You've defined at two different scopes. Look at your code for two instances of Try removing the local instance and add to the other one. I'm not sure why the documentation is the way it is. The method is clearly looking for an initialized object. If it was to work as stated in their example, they'd need the parameter option in the method to show that object will be initialized inside the method. 

This is simply a bit of advertising and a warning mixed in to one. They're promoting the fact that you can speed up your progress in the game with purchases. Further, they're letting you know that if you don't want to spend any money, even accidentally, you can disable in-app purchases in the general settings of your device. 

The reasons for each game is really only known to the developer. I plan on including the scripts in my game for one simple reason, I want users to be able to customize the game. There are a few benefits I can think of for not compiling the scripts: 

Using CI, just like any merge situation with binary data, the old data is simply replaced as a whole. You have the same end result, the data is up-to-date. The only downside is the transfer time. Since you have to transmit the entire file, instead of just the delta. As for testing the art/other binary data. You have to think about: how can the art/binary assets fail? 

The jerk is the rate of change in your acceleration. You may want to check out the equations of motion. EDIT Since your math is coming back to you, you may remember that using the Euler form above is fairly inaccurate. So you may remember this little integration with respect to time process from physics: 

Yes it's possible, but it's not without its complications. While frame interpolation can work real-time on videos, that isn't necessarily the case with video games. Even though this is processing real-time on videos, the software is able to "look ahead" to the next frame. This is a pretty critical component of interpolation. This is where the issue comes into play with games. Most of the time, next next frame has not been rendered yet! So the software doesn't know the next point in the interpolation. There's certainly the possibility of running the game a frame or two behind in order to give your interpolation software the frames it needs to work with. However, this doesn't work as well for media that is interactive. Now what's being shown on screen is delayed from the input being received. This does make things more tricky for processing input and providing a good responsiveness to the game. It's like building in an artificial performance lag. Additionally, it's unlikely to have native support in any of the major game engines, which means writing your own. 

Where is the string you want to break and is the maximum number of characters allowed per line. To find out what should be, you'll likely want to find the average width in pixels of your characters, then see how many you can fit in the space you have available. 

The method works when Unity casts a ray into the scene from the camera position towards the cursor position when mouse button is pressed. If the ray hits a collider, like the one attached to your object, it will call the method for that object. This means there's no way to buffer the click radius of the object in relation to its size on screen. The click detection is controlled by the collider of the object. So, if you want to increase the clickable area around the object, without changing the visual size of the object, you need to increase the size of the collider. 

Now, since your drawing seems to be working, that's likely not a big issue, but it shows me that there are likely more subtle issues if this one has been missed. 

You need to create a Custom Block. With the custom block you can make your own logic, and lucky for you, the page even provides distance between actors (X distance anyway) as the example: 

The (doc) will hold information about position, deltas and gesture type. These values will help you decide what type of action to perform and how to perform it. Try following a small tutorial like this one to get you started. The code is very similar to what I wrote: 

Each object should have its own bone. Each bone should be unconnected to the others and able to move freely. This allows you to animate each bone, with position and rotation, while still keeping the model as one. Each bone is really just a matrix to apply to the vertices under it's control. It's simple to imagine applying a translation and rotation to each group of vertices that make up each portion of the complete object above. Allowing them to separate and move independently of each other. You should use the 3D modeling/animation program you're most familiar with. If your program allows for simulations with physics, you can utilize it to physically simulate the collapse. Alternatively, you can do the animation by hand, using key frames. Animating by hand will be challenging, but should be simple enough with the right approach. I would start by moving the top and having the near bottom one collapse, moving the other parts to follow. But, really, that's an artistic question and there are many different ways to do it. 

Amit Patel has provided an excellent resource for getting ranges on his site. In the article, he uses the following algorithm for collecting hex tiles within a range: 

Now that we know the data, lets look at a high level overview of the algorithm. The basic idea of the system is to prioritize flowing down and out. As I explain in the video, I work from the bottom up. Each layer of water is processed one level at a time in the y axis. The cubes for each level are processed randomly, each cube will attempt to pull water from its source on each iteration. Flow cubes pull water from their source by following their flow direction back up until they reach a source cube or a flow cube with no parent. Storing the flow direction in each cube makes following the path to the source as easy as traversing a linked list. The pseudo code for the algorithm is as follows: 

I wrote an exporter for blender models that works great for meshes. I'm attempting to extend that to bones defined in blender. However I haven't found good information for exporting bone data. How can I access bone data? I'd like access all the vertices that the bone affects, the weight of each vertex and the matrix. Do I need to export anything else for skeletal animation and dynamic dismemberment? 

The color picking method you linked is suitable for "3D isometric", depending on how you implement it. This is because 3D isometric is not well defined and can have a similar "ground" as 2D isometric. So the tiles will be the same, what will change is the objects in the world. The objects will be 3D and placed so they fit in with the camera angle of your isometric world. A full 3D world would not technically be called isometric. 

If instead you're asking about how to find the trajectory its self (which I'm guessing could be the case, but that's not clear in the body of your question). The trajectory is equal to the cursor position minus the player position. 

OK, so I found your problem. I don't, however, know why it's the problem. I plugged your code into mine, everything was the same except the matrices. The matrices retrieved from OpenGL did not match the ones I was generating. So, if you would, try upgrading your camera class to generate those matrices for you. There's a few functions you'll need: 

There are changes you can make to both to offset the pros and cons. For example you can make the static indicator pop down when activated, but always pop down to the same spot. Or you can make the dynamic indicator large enough that it couldn't be covered up. User interfaces benefit greatly from play testing. It's often hard to tell how people will want to use the application until they start using it. For these types of play testing, give it to people and leave the room, so they can test it without you watching over them. Try giving some people instructions and let others try to figure it out on their own. Have a few different versions of the UI implemented for them to test. 

Essentially this issue is similar to a collision avoidance problem. Yes, the planes can fly at different altitudes, but their labels are all at the same "altitude". There are algorithms like Unaligned Collision Avoidance, that would be a step in the right direction for you. Of course for your situation, the labels are "tethered" to their planes, so they have a limited range of movement. If you look at Flocking Behavior, you want to implement the first "rule" of flocking: short range repulsion. However, instead of "steering" in the direction that is away from the nearest neighbors, you'll use the "away" vector as the placement location for your label. For example: 

So should developers take any of the above action? Like most things related to humans, it's a balancing act. The number of variables involved in the decision is enormous and ever changing. Since no one knows the exact recipe for perfection, it's impossible to know if the changes you make will make the game better or worse. Even then, most any change will be received as bad by some and good by others. The best course will depend on the game and the developers and their obligations. 

If you want to continue to draw a line off screen, you need to continually update your code with a point that's off screen. This means that your method should take the current position of the camera, plus half the screen width plus some buffer amount. Then, whenever your camera moves the buffer amount in the x direction, you update the next vector. In this way, your line will always be just ahead of the camera's view port. Making the line appear to be endless. 

No. 3DSMax is not a game engine. You'll have far more difficulty creating a game in 3DSMax than you would moving the models into a proper engine. If it takes so much effort to move the models from 3DSMax to your engine of choice, you're using the wrong engine, or you're doing it wrong. If you're really in charge of these types of decisions for a team, you really need to learn more about the technology involved. 

LWJGL does not have a physics library built in to it. If you want to add collision detection to LWJGL, you'll need to create the collision detection yourself or use an existing library to add physics and collision detection to your game. 

You can either change the size of your bounding box to encompass the entire object and all it's possible sizes (not very realistic). Or you can make multiple physics objects for the game object. The physics boxes would surround all the moving parts of the game object, and move with those parts in animations. 

Basically, what this gives us are some values we can use to manipulate the noise we get, to better fit what we expect from land. Since black is "nothing" and white is "solid", adding and/or multiplying the above gradient to any noise we get will ensure the world is (mostly) "solid" at the bottom and "nothing" at the top. 2) Yes, those values are mapped as the gradient image above. How should you interpret them? Ideally the noise values would return values from to . Then, you'll pick some cut off point, like , and everything larger than that value is empty space and everything smaller than it is solid (or vise versa, it doesn't really matter as long as you are consistent). Now when you're building your world, if it's Terraria style, you'd sample the noise at discrete intervals. Each sample would tell you the value of the noise at that position. That value will be determined as solid or not, so you decide if you want to put a tile there based on the noise value. 3) ANL describes fBm with: 

What you're describing is essentially client-side prediction, but you don't say what happens when the server and client disagree. It evolved from the days when the client was just a dumb terminal, sending its input to the server, and the server told the client the outcome. However, once games moved beyond the LAN (and frequently before) the latency was noticeable in this situation. What you're describing, client-side prediction was introduced to fix that. Now the client also simulates the movement while waiting for the server to respond. Then they come to an agreement on the outcome. With the server being the authority. The next steps are how you respond to disagreements. If you don't have anything in place for that, you'll get the client rubber-banding or tele-porting when the client and server disagree. 

So most of this is just off the top of my head, so it probably won't make sense without further explanation. So just let me know what you're not clear on. Basically, I've given you a lot to work on :)
