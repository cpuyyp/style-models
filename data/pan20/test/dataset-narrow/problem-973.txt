Turns out it is 64 - found this out by deleting the value, restarting the dock, clicking on the resizing area but not dragging it, letting go, and then checking the value. 

I've been playing around with docking, and have noticed I can grab the desktop and drag it to the left or right of the screen. Doing so does not just make the desktop smaller, it turns it into a list of icons of what is open on the desktop. When you click one of these icons, it undoes the docking and take you to full screen desktop. What's the purpose of this? Can anyone provide a real life use case for this behavior? 

My iPhone and iPad are connected to my Exchange server, and right after an e-mail is sent, both of them light up and receive it. I also run Outlook 2010 (connected to the same Exchange server), and starting a few days ago it stopped receiving e-mail right after it is sent. Sometimes it will come in 10 minutes late, other times, it won't come in until I restart Outlook. All the e-mail will come in when I restart Outlook. Any thoughts on what's going on? Update 1: Here's an image of my connection status: 

I always turned off Action Center in Windows 7 - is there anything new in Windows 8 worth keeping it around for? 

I'm trying to set it back to it was when I installed El Capitan. I accidentally grabbed the slider and resized it. 

When customizing your theme, you can choose to have Windows automatically set colors. It seems to change automatically based on the background you choose. How does this work? Does it sense which colors are in your background image and do color math to figure out what the theme should be? 

I didn't use a password when I used puttygen to create the private key, so I just press OK. And then I get this error: 

I recently installed a copy of Windows 8 on a computer that didn't have connectivity, so I ended up creating an account that was not associated with a Windows Live ID. I am able to see all of the applications that come stock with Windows 8, and update them. What are some of the benefits or drawbacks of logging in with an online account? Will I be able to use that same online account, even if I don't have connectivity? 

That's because 100% in Excel is actually 1.0, not 100.0 In most cases here you are telling REPT to repeat something less than once, so it prints nothing. Instead of dividing by 2 you should be multiplying by (100 / inc) where inc is the percentage points you want per repeated text. 

Lua has the os.rename() function to actually do the file renaming or you could probably dump the text output of the script into a renaming utility. 

If you can't get the values to parse correctly when you enter them into the cell you can use the TIME() function to get the right values. For example: 

You can and then select PNG-8 format, turn dither to 0% and reduce the number of colours down to just a few. I got reasonable results with your sample image by reducing the number of colours to 6. 

Method 1: New values in another column Assuming you have a datetime values in column A, you could calculate new values in another column with: 

Check if NUM LOCK is turned on. On laptops without separate number keypads, keys on the right hand side of the keyboard often do double duty as a numeric keypad. 

You could try GraphicsMagick which is a derivative of ImageMagick and claims to have many improvements, including performance. I have not tried it myself. 

When dealing with external data sources, Excel usually saves the current values of cells referring to linked data in case the data source isn't available when the workbook is reopened later. You can change how this situation is presented to the user with 

You can specify field widths for . Here are examples of printing numbers (spaces or zeros as prefix) and strings (left or right justified): 

You haven't said whether you values in column 2 are unique. You can find the first occurences of the minimum and maximum in column 2 (B) and retrieve the corresponding values in column 1 (A) with: 

These instructions apply to Excel 2007 and 2010. Excel 2003 also supports Lists but without as much functionality as the later versions, if I recall correctly. 

Most off-the-shelf OCR packages are designed to recognise text from scanned documents or similar and expect reasonable text alignment, angle of view and contrast settings. You will probably need to do pre-processing on your images to (a) detect and crop to the area of the image containing the license plate, (b) perform perspective correction and optionally (c) contrast and noise enhancements for the night shots. 

Indeed, if two domains have the same IP address, the server relies on the browser to specify the requested domain. Like: 

Though that part of your question is off-topic, for the sake of completeness: onlinecronservices.com lists some web services that can do remote calls for you. The free services are not too reliable I guess, or only allow for one invocation per day. 

This surely only works when saving from, say, Notepad, and then also keeps the default from being added. I am not 100% sure it also worked in Windows Explorer. In Windows XP, it does not work from Windows Explorer though, as one cannot even type quotes then. And without the quotes it would yield "You must type a file name." because it doesn't like the leading dot. The same errors when using the dialog as shown using right-click » Properties.) 

The above is a pretty standard way to load some external JavaScript each time it's clicked. That external script uses some personal ID to know to which email address to send the result. Today, that JavaScript does not look very harmful: it sends the HTML source code of the page you're viewing to the toread's servers, which will then send the email. So, the HTML source code will be known to toread, implying one should be careful using this for very personal sites. But: the external JavaScript could change. Worse: if the value of that personal id can easily be guessed, then spammers could send their page to random users of this service. But today, that personal ID is a 12 digits hexadecimal code, so I doubt it's just an incrementing number that anyone can randomly try. One cannot know if/when the external JavaScripts needs to be reloaded after something changed on the toread's servers. So, to answer your question: one should not use this service without getting the latest version of that external JavaScript. Hence, getting rid of the bookmarklet does not make a lot of sense either. Today, it does not look harmful though. 

So I guess that Internet Explorer will always be installed on the hard drive, and one can (temporarily) enable it to use it, or to download any other browser. 

I wonder about the "a" in "a VPN connection": is this a VPN connection to some third-party server? If yes, then: 

SciTE v2.23 on Windows seems to work fine with these character sets for me. Have you set the encoding to UTF-8? 

Yes, it's quite easy to achieve using the Polygonal Lasso tool in Photoshop. (You may wish to delete the background first using the Magnetic Lasso tool.) Use the Polygonal Lasso tool to select the first pie slice then cut it to the clipboard. Then create a new document and paste the slice on to that. By cutting and pasting in this way you are moving the image pixels so you avoid the risk of accidentally copying the same pixels (on the edge of a slice) to more than one of the new A4 images you are creating. Tip: You will probably want to select Antialias on the Polygonal Lasso tool and use a small feather (1 px) or none at all (0 px). 

A hard link is a file system feature that cannot cross a file system boundary. You can't hard link files on C: to D: because they are separate file systems. They might each contain the same type of file sytem (eg. NTFS) but they are separate file systems. 

No, not in Excel and still retaining it as a numeric value. But, if you are willing to accept "E+n" where n is a multiple of 3 you can use custom number formats such as: 

When entering a new formula, press F4 immediately after a cell reference to toggle between, for example, $A$1, A$1 and $A1 and A1. When editing an existing formula, press F4 when your cursor is at the start, end or inside a cell reference. 

You want the Magic Wand tool (shortcut key is W). This allows you to select similar areas by adjusting the Tolerance value. I would suggest a starting value of about 20. Use smaller values to select a smaller range of similar RGB values. As well as adjusting the Tolerance, you can also use the Shift key to add to your existing selection. You can optionally touch up your selection by going into Quick Mask mode (Q) and using the brush tool (B). Depending on what you want to acheive, you can either delete (Del) the selection to make the area transparent or you can use the selection to create a layer mask to achieve the transparency. (Layer -> Layer Mask - Hide selection) If this is the background you're dealing with, you'll need to promote it to a layer first. (Right click on the Background in the Layers window and select Layer from Background) 

To get rid of this data: in Google Chrome "Delete cookies and other site data" does the trick. In Firefox, it's deleted whenever cookies are deleted. Not so much in Safari. In Safari there seems to be a related preference in Security, button "Show databases". However: that list of "Show databases" in Safari does NOT mention stackauth.com, as used by the Stack Exchange global network auto-login. And after using "Remove all", I still get results on that site: 

Though not perfect: in Finder simply press the Spacebar to activate Quick Look, which offers a read-only view of many file formats without requiring to have the file's application installed. 

...or to eject the disk from Finder's sidebar: first go into Finder's preferences to make connected servers show on the desktop, and then when connected drag the disk into the sidebar. OS X will remember you once dragged it in there, and show it whenever you connect again. There's also a GUI, Macfusion (see also the SSHFS installation notes when using Macfusion). 

Even worse, neither the greyed-out "Use Default: Always Ask" in the above screen capture, nor enabling "Tell you when a website asks to store data for offline use" in settings, Advanced, Network, have any effect to avoid storage: 

These kind of tracking images are often called web bugs. Some mail server software (such as MailScanner) can quite accurately tell web bugs from normal images, and then disarm the web bugs by removing or replacing them. But Gmail does not claim to try that, though a few say Gmail in fact does. 

They can, but it's a different ISP, which is playing nicer. The user's ISP, which is throttling, does not know anything about the data that is fetched through the VPN connection. At the other end of the VPN connection, there's a different ISP between the VPN server and Netflix, which does not throttle. 

Even when the very quick way from the accepted answer somehow does not work for you, then still no trickery is needed at all: 

It's the LinkedIn JavaScript that is messing up. You can easily find it using Firebug. In its Net tab right-click the header to enable displaying "protocol" as well, and then sort by that. 

So, for the best user experience on browsers that do show a warning, the login page itself should indeed be served by HTTPS as well. Any bank will do that. On sites that don't, users indeed need to do the validation themselves, or install a plugin or use some Greasemonkey script to decorate safe forms, or show some warning. For Chrome a third-party extension is available as well, but I never used that. __________ † Thinking about it, maybe I like the change: it might make more people enable HTTPS on their site, not having to worry about warnings when interacting with third-party sites that do not use HTTPS yet. 

As far as I'm aware, ZFS doesn't support resizing but you can easily add additional disks or partitions to your ZFS pool using . In your case, create a partition in the unallocated space and then add it to the pool. The additional space will be available to all ZFS filesystems in the pool. Another option is to create a new 20GB (or larger) virtual disk and then use and to move your filesystem(s) to it. But if this is your boot volume, then the first suggestion will be much easier. 

It is not the hardware specs that are causing the problem. Just because a computer/laptop meets certain hardware requirements does not mean it will support an operating system. 

In your case where the pool has no redundancy, the scrubbing process will not be able to correct any bit errors but it will tell you which files are affected and you can manually copy them from your good volume to the affected volume. Alternatively and at the expense of disk capacity, you can give your single-disk pool redundancy at the ZFS filesystem level by using the property to tell ZFS to create multiple copies: 

Modern operating systems use RAM quite efficiently, dynamically adjusting its use to meet the current load on the system. You'd be better off spending your money on additional RAM instead of something that claims to optimise the RAM you already have. 

Short answer: NO. However, sites often provide a checksum such as SHA1 or MD5 to help you verify a successful download. You can create the checksum and then Google it. For example, I have a file: 

I regularly copy and paste queries between Excel and SQL Server Studio and I don't encounter the problems you describe. As long as the database is identified in the connection string in Excel then you shouldn't need to put the database name in front of every table or column name. Alternatively, you can specify the database name at the beginning of the query: 

is being expanded to the name of your batch file instead of being passed to as a template for multiple filenames. You should use a double percentage mark to prevent this: 

Fireworks appears to be a product that Adobe picked up when it purchased Macromedia. It focuses on image creation mainly for online use (web, mobile and applications). Photoshop has more features. For people creating mainly online content, Fireworks probably has most/all the features they need and probably suits their workflow better than Photoshop. It's horses for courses. From the Adobe Fireworks FAQ: Q: What's the relationship between Fireworks and Adobe Photoshop® software? A: Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard for digital imaging, with a broad array of features and functionality used by photographers, graphic designers, web designers, and many other creative professionals. While Fireworks does have some overlapping functionality, its vector and bitmap toolset is made for designers and developers who need features for wireframing, comping, prototyping, and creating optimized images for the web, mobile, and application interfaces. Fireworks imports and exports PSD files with high fidelity for smooth workflows between applications.
