I think, this potentional issue is called load-balancing router. It routes your request sometimes to the 1st interface and sometimes to the 2nd. They have different latency. For example, we have optics on wan1 and ADSL on wan2. For one particular server ping through wan1 was 17 ms and through ADSL - 112 ms. 

You need user account on the server (login/password may be different, than for your ftp-account). This user must be or have permissions to run . 

Yes, it have. You should look at flag in your . Here is the output from my system that uses this processor (two lines are for two cores): 

I'm not the system administrator for this server but I'm trying to help the group who are sys admins to find a fix quickly. For this reason, I don't have access to all of the server configuration files. With that out of the way, here's my question: This is regarding a Java EE application on a Solaris machine with Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 and Sun Java System Application Server 8.1. The web server is acting as a proxy for requests going to the application server. My understanding is that it's also set up as a load balancer, though it only points to one application instance so it seems there's nothing to balance. When making requests through the proxy to the application, we're intermittently seeing a purple/blue page that says the following: 

I've loaded this files to document root and opened in Firefox 3.5. I see the first frame, see controls, but can't play video. This video plays good even from my server. How should I encode video to view it in browser? UPD: If I start playing video from the middle, everything works fine. 

I've 2 remote HP Proliant DL180 G6 servers with HP Integrated Lights Out enabled on both and I have to install RHEL5 on these servers. I try to do it with ILO - mounted ISO file from local hard drive as Virtual CD-ROM, and performed installation from ILO console. OS installation on the first server was successful. But I have to make 3 tries to achive this. The channel between me and the servers is too slow - they are in datacenter. The installation takes a long time - 5-6 hours. So sometimes Virtual CD accidently unmounts and installation hangs. How can I perform the installation on the other server in more convinient way? 

What could be causing this error page to come up? Thanks, Jeff Update: Here's the load balancer configuration: 

I've got Hudson (continuous integration system) with the git plugin running on a Tomcat Windows Service. msysgit is installed and the msysgit bin dir is in the path. PuTTY/Pageant/plink are installed and msysgit is configured to use them. The trouble I'm running in to, I think, is that the user who owns the Tomcat/Hudson service (Local System) has no SSH key set up to be able to clone the git repository. When the git Hudson plugin tries to clone it gives the error: 

I need to monitor a single process (e.g. be warned when there are more than 3000 connections established) and collect statistics on it (e.g. to determine how many connections were established today 01:20 AM, when the server worked too slow, as client said). What tools should I use? 

I think you have some kind of MTU problem. It happens when you send packet larger then minimum MTU on the network path (PMTU) with bit set, and ICMP error message is somewhere blocked. You should check local and remote firewalls to allow ICMP first. Then trace path to see what the PMTU is and where package drop can occure. Turn on bit! You should do this on the same port you use for client-server communications. Use hping2, for example. If nothing helped, turn off PMTU discovery on both machines. 

As I mentioned, we see this screen intermittently maybe one request out of every 100-500. When we do see the screen, it is returned without delay. In other words, it doesn't seem to be timeout related. Refreshing the page will cause the actual application page being requested to display. In other words, it doesn't seem that there was a temporary server outage in that 1-2 seconds between the error page loading, the refresh, and the real page loading. I don't think the network is an issue since the web and application servers are on the same host. The web server logs have the following error when this error page appears: [02/Feb/2009:15:37:32] warning (19614): reports: lb.runtime: ROUT1014: Non-idempotent request /applicationContext cannot be retried. [02/Feb/2009:15:37:32] info (19614): reports: lb.runtime: RNTM3003 : Error servicing the request : selected server could not service 

You should place it somewhere outside webserver root, for example. It has security considerations: webserver code must not be exposed to uploaded code, and it can happen, if you mix these two things and set wrong permissions. And you keep your content between upgrades. If users upload small files, the best way is to store them in database. 

I have VMWare ESXi 4.0 preinstalled on the server with IP A. I also can use IPs B and C. I have KVM access to this server and I can connect to it using vSphere Client. CentOS iso-image isn't on the server. My task is to create two virtual machines on this host and install CentOS 5.4 on both. Then I have to configure network, so guest1 is accessible on IP B and guest2 is accessible on IP C. Can anyone provide me a brief howto on this topic? I tried to find it, but found nothing. 

I've run into the same problem, both with Shannon Cornish's approach and with Tim Davis' approach. I'm still stuck. Have you tried Tim Davis' approach as well? I've read on various cygwin-related sites that if the SSH daemon is running (indirectly) as a Windows administrator then this problem goes away. I'm running cygwin/sshd as a user who's in the admin group, so has full privileges to all files but I still get the same Win32 error 1114 as you. Please post back if you've resolved the problem or if any of either of my pointers works for you. Edit: A Cygwin dev describes the relationship between cyg_server, Win32 errors, and Domain security. I haven't fully ruled this out as the cause but in my case I'm not trying to SSH using a Domain user so it sounds like it wouldn't be an issue. Also, in case it helps: Mark Embling describing similar setup to Shannon's but continuing into more detail on Gitosis
