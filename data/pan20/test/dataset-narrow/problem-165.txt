Regarding question 1 on mobile device licensing Per your comment below, I did a couple tests on our ASA5525-X which has Essentials/Mobile licenses. I was indeed able to limit access using Dynamic Access Policies. I setup a test policy allowing only iOS devices on iPad2,7 models to connect in a new policy. Then I setup the default policy to terminate sessions. This worked and allowed my Verizon iPad Mini to connect but not my iPhone. Here is the license breakdown: 

First, I highly recommend you check out this book on Hyper-V. Specifically you will want to read the chapter on Networking, subsection Advanced Networking. Second, you definitely want VLANs to split out traffic types. It is unfortunate that you're stuck with 1 10GbE adapter that you wish to share with SAN, management and VM traffic. The method I would look at would be this: Vlans 

Latency is the amount of time it takes a packet of data to leave your computer and receive a response back from the end point. That is why this is measure in time. This is key for time sensitive applications like VoIP and video conferencing. Bandwidth/data rate is the amount of data (bits) you can upload or download in a given time (seconds). This is key for downloads and uploads (i.e. video streaming for Hulu, Netflix, etc). It is also important in video conferencing as you're sending/receiving a lot of video (bandwidth) and the audio portion needs to be in near real time (latency). Ping is sending packets using ICMP and measuring the time it takes until you receive an echo-reply from the end point. It is not sending a lot of data and would not give any accurate information regarding bandwidth. Something like iperf may be used to measure bandwidth by sending a lot of data to the end point which also would be running perf. You can have high latency (slow round trip time for packets) but still have a lot of bandwidth. Satellite service is one example. 

We have two Cisco 2602E APs and one Cisco 3602E AP deployed at a location in China. They are connected to an HP ProCurve 2910al PoE switch. The 3602E powers up fine when the switch is rebooted (i.e. power loss, they have rolling blackouts in this city) but the 2602E APs both require someone pressing the mode button on them before they power on. Before the mode button is pressed, the HP switch shows no device on the ports and no power being pulled on them. The APs have no LED activity, they appear off. When someone presses the mode button they mysteriously power on. The HP switch now shows power draw and their LED turns on. The cable runs to them are around 200'. The switch is PoE+ so it has plenty of wattage to cover any loss over the distance. The 3602 is on a shorter run and has no issues. We have a second facility in China with the same setup and they do not have this issue. All APs have the same boot loader and IOS per model (i.e. the 2602Es in each site have the same boot loader and IOS rev). This same issue occurs when using a Cisco 3560C PoE+ switch and the existing cabling setup. As this is in China, my ability to troubleshoot is a bit limited right now. I am hoping someone has experienced a similar problem and can point me in the right direction. This wouldn't be such a big issue if the APs weren't mounted in a factory ceiling that requires a lift to get to them for pressing the mode button. What could be causing the 2602Es to not power up with the switch? 

However, when I try to load this file on an AP, I get a different set of info for the image. Direct from the file in the tar file: 

You can see why the file system is full, someone copied a firmware tarball direct to the AP's flash instead of using the archive command to pull it remotely. Easy fix though, just delete the tarball: 

If you're dead set on using the ASA to route local traffic instead of the switch, you will need to update the ASA with NAT statements for inter-VLAN communication and also add to the configuration to allow traffic to go to the ASA and back out the ASA on the same interface. 

Many Cisco devices include the command to check the file system with. If you run this command on the flash, it will attempt to fix file system errors for you. These were my results: 

Without seeing what your setup is this example isn't going to be entirely accurate. However here is how I would configure Site A. Site B would be similar, minus the remote VPN pieces and reversing Site A and Site B pieces. Anything in brackets needs to be filled in with your own information. Also, for this particular example, the remote VPN would be through the Cisco VPN Client and not the AnyConnect Client. ShrewSoft VPN Client also works. 

Then power supply 1 from the switches go into PDU 1. And power supply 2 from switches goes into PDU 2. Very neat but uses more space than a lot of people would prefer. Easy to keep track of patch panel ports connecting to switch ports (top row is odd, bottom is even... depending on switch model). Limits you to 240 ports in a 42U rack. 

Well, this appears to have proved that the file system is full. But did it fix the issue with the flash system so I could look at the flash system to find files to delete? Yes: 

I would not route Vlan 20 at all. Switch Setup On the switch, the 10GbE port would be configured for trunking. The 3 1GbE ports would be configured for LACP, switch port access vlan 40. Host VM Switch #1 On each host you would add a VM switch to the 10GbE adapter. Then you would add Management OS VM net adapters (Hyper-V terms) to this switch. One for actual management and one for iSCSI (and a third for failover cluster communication if you're using FC). You will configure each adapter to its own specific vlan and assign appropriate IPs. Host LACP Team / VM Switch #2 Then you would create a network team in Server 2012 for your 3 1GbE ports. You will want to use LACP with HyperVPort load balancing. After this you build a second VM switch using this network team for the VMs external traffic. VM Network Adapters When you create your VMs, you can add a NIC on the second switch for external traffic, a NIC on the first switch in Vlan 20 for SAN traffic (if needed, though I recommend their own Vlan for SAN with specific security on the SAN boxes if this is a must so they cannot modify VM storage) and a NIC on the first switch for inter-vlan traffic in Vlan 30. QoS For each virtual NIC on the hosts, you will want to add some sort of QoS to make sure the SAN traffic has priority on the 10GbE link. Lastly, this has more to do with best practices for your virtualization environment and you may wish to move this to Server Fault. 

This is caused by the SRE-V 2.0.1 package scripts. The script in this package doesn't support using a different port for the download. While the same script from the WLC package does support using a different port. When switching the HTTP server hosting the files to port 80, the SRE-V 2.0.1 package will install fine. 

Some of these commands will already be on your ASA as you're sending your buffered log to an FTP server. I won't include the FTP commands due to this. Then you will want to look for the specific codes you're interested in, in the log on the FTP server. Example IPSec L2L disconnect message: 

Would using Radius be an option? You can differentiate AD groups using radius attribute 25 (class). Full walk through from Jeff Boyer on the Cisco forums may be found at: $URL$ 

Notes All of the logging above is limited to notifications and higher level (i.e. level 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1). If you find a code of a lower level, you will need to replace with or . The example event above () is which you can see from the prefix on the event. 

It is connected to my laptop running Python's SimpleHTTPServer via another 2911. Routing on both routers is setup so my local subnet can reach the SM1/0 IPs. The router loads the installer and launches it without issue: 

Why not simplify things and do an nslookup on the IP, grab the hostname from DNS and use the hostname to find the computer via an asset list or management database? Or if you don't have reverse DNS setup you could log into the DHCP server to pull the host name. I know it isn't a Cisco/CLI method, but it should work if your users are assigned to computers 1-1. If you are many to 1, you can use Windows/Linux tools to find out the current user of the computer. 

This is a shot in the dark but it sounds like you need Prime configured so you can setup a profile for wIPS. The alert is telling you that a profile is not configured yet. I have not gotten this far in my own deployment of some 5508s/PI so I cannot say for certain. EDIT: Reading further, the default profiles are also supplied by Prime, not the WLC: 

Well, one way to do this would be to exclude the entire pool from assignment. This would leave the configuration of the pool in there and you would just remove the exclusion if you wanted it to assign addresses again. 

We are running a Cisco WLC 5508 with version 7.6.120. We have over 100 autonomous APs around the globe. The latest CAPWAP firmware from Cisco's website for these APs contains CAPWAP code for 7.6.100, not 7.6.120. So each AP I load this with and reboot will then download the latest firmware from the WLC so it has 7.6.120. This causes a lot more downtime on the APs, especially ones over poor WAN connections. Some sites are 24/7 operations and downtime on the APs can cause production problems if there is not adequate overlapping WIFI coverage. So I am trying to find a way to pull the update from WLC manually to my laptop to preload on the AP so when I reboot it I only need to configure it in WLC, not wait for it to download another full firmware package. That or send the latest code direct from the WLC to the autonomous AP. Is this possible? Or am I stuck loading firmware twice on these APs to convert them? EDIT: The AP models are 1252, 1262, 2602E, and 3602E all running various 15.X autonomous firmware. EDIT3: I've tried Smithers' suggestion of grabbing the firmware from a fully updated CAPWAP AP connected to the WLC. It appears to work when I generate the tar file:
