I don't know if this is likely, but if we imagine an additional record, essentially a duplicate of the data in record with id 6: 

Yes, selecting from the table is interesting, but not surprising given the warning. (I don't have a MariaDB 10.2 instance at the moment, but testing on dbfiddle.uk indicates it too fails, though again not silently.) MariaDB 10.3.6, default sql_mode (strict) No warnings. select * from g; Gives: 

It's because you're calling the stored procedure with empty string values rather than NULL values. The IFs and ELSEIFs in the SP body are testing for NULL, not empty string. 

One factor that can cause the creation of temp disk tables is the inclusion of or columns in the s. To avoid this you can use the function in the to shorten the data as you may not need the full contents of that column in the result set. However, it seems a / query will only create a temporary disk table if other factors in the query cause the creation of temporary (non-disk) tables. Also, is really shorthand for which means the database needs to eliminate duplicates to produce the result set. Use instead of just to avoid what in this case looks like wasted effort. In many cases you will see that the UNION RESULT line disappears from the EXPLAIN because the database no longer needs to create a temporary table. According to the MariaDB Knowledge Base on UNION/UNION ALL: 

Additionally, it's possible that another software (such as cPanel) might change the variable dynamically after MariaDB has started. To see which options the MariaDB server will get from the option files, run: 

I wonder whether I can change the font in the "edit data" window in pgAdmin III. I use Windows 7 and OS X 10.10. 

One integrity constraint stemming from common sense / knowledge is that the patient more than one year old at the time of hospital admission (i.e. ), shouldn't say that the patient is a neonate. Another integrity constraint from common sense / knowledge is that a patient cannot be admitted in the hospital if he already is in the hospital (i.e. some checks would have to be done around and ). 

This made me think that the SQL area on Oracle DB grew too much to the point of maxing out the shared pool's memory. Running the follow query would confirm it, but ironically and unsurprisingly I get theÂ ORA-04031 error on it as well: 

I am sure the SSH server is working fine. I manage to connect to the same PostgreSQL database server through the same SSH server with pgAdmin 3 and RazorSQL. I have checked the IP, username and password, they are correct. I disabled all firewalls. What could be the issue? My settings: 

How can I copy the content of a cell in the output pane where the latter is detached from the query window in pgAdmin III? When the output pane is not detached from the query window, I can use control + C, but it doesn't seem to work when it is detached. Here is a screenshot showing the output pane detached from the query window: 

I wonder whether there is any way to jump to a given line number in the "edit data" window in pgAdmin III. 

The InnoDB buffer pool is essentially a huge cache. (A variant of LRU - 'Least Recently Used'). If your working set data fits into that cache, then queries will usually be relatively fast. On the other hand, if the working set data doesn't fit into that cache, then MySQL will have to retrieve some of the data from disk (or whichever storage medium is used), and this is significantly slower. Running can bring huge amounts of otherwise unused data into the buffer pool, and at the same time the (potentially useful) data that is already there will be evicted and flushed to disk. There are ways to avoid or minimise this problem: 

This table structure makes the trigger unnecessary, and it also allows more than one rating for each product. If you want to allow a certain user to rate a certain product more than once, then you need a special column to be the primary key as in the other tables, call it e.g. product_rating_id. 

UPDATED ANSWER BASED ON CLARIFICATIONS IN QUESTION I think because of the requirement that you can't use a constant default value for the state name, but must get the value from the States table, the solution would necessarily require triggers. So: Create your tables like this: 

Then create the triggers - I'm relying on your comment that there is only ever one record in the States table, but this could be modified to use the first record or use some other condition if you want more recorrds in that table: 

You can use an audit plugin, such as MariaDB's audit plugin which also works for MySQL, see: $URL$ For MariaDB's plugin, you can configure it to log DCL queries only, which should cover CREATE/DROP PROCEDURE. 

How can I list all the databases of a PostgreSQL database server with RazorSQL? I would like to graphically navigate between databases. I use RazorSQL 6.3.14 with Windows 7 SP1 x64 Ultimate. 

Since amazingly with pgAdmin one has to login to view issues / feature request, here is a screenshot: 

In Oracle SQL Developer, is there any way to include a SQL file within a SQL query? Like the command in LaTeX. Example: 

At that point if you try to connect you'll have the same error message. Go to the shell and run the command: 

Go back to DBeaver, try to connect, that should work. I still don't know why I should use instead of the SSH tunnel tab in DBeaver though. 

You can use csvsql, which is part of (a suite of utilities for converting to and working with CSV files): 

Is there any way to disable the fade in and fade out effects in pgAdmin 4 when opening windows? Example of fade in and fade out: 

I downloaded a SQLite 3 dump of Northwind, and opened it in SQLiteStudio. Accented characters aren't displayed nicely. How to solve the issue? I suspect some encoding issue. 

The Wikipedia page on data integrity lists 4 types of integrity constraints: entity integrity, referential integrity, domain integrity, and user-defined integrity. Is there a name for integrity constraints that stem from common sense / knowledge? 

Is there anyway to export the results of a query in Oracle SQL Developer without having to execute the query twice? Running a SQL query in worksheet, then Right click on Result Set window -> Export Data -> Text will run the query a second time. 

As of December 2017, unfortunately the answer to all three questions a), b) and c) is no. One thing you can do is try to avoid that unnecessary data get loaded into the buffer pool. One way this could happen is when you backup a database with logical backup tools such as mysqldump and mydumper. So instead you could use Percona's xtrabackup or other physical backup tools, and/or you could tweak and so as to minimize the impact of logical backups as well as full table scans. (See e.g. this for more details.) 

Is creating columns for all the combinations the correct way? Based on the little information you have given us: No, columns for all combinations is probably not the right solution. Imagine if you suddenly get more products, then you will need to add more columns. Or if some products are removed. Designing your schema so you have to alter a table to deal with something as trivial is bad practice. No, you should probably use records instead. Let's say you have a table, something like this: 

This looks like a bug (though it isn't technically a bug, see my first edit towards the end of the answer): I see the behaviour on MySQL 5.7.20 and 5.7.21 (on Centos 7.4 if it matters): 

Check your config files and and look for the socket parameter. Make sure it's the same for client and server. A good place for the socket parameter is in the [client-server] section in . The socket file is created by the MariaDB server when it starts up. Note that there are other places where MariaDB config files could reside, and these could potentially override your settings in the two files mentioned above. For more details, see this page in the MariaDB KB. Also note that you may be able to connect to MariaDB through TCP rather than through the socket. You can specify that you want to use TCP rather than the socket with . If this is successful, you can then do to find out where the socket file really is (or should be). You can then connect with or edit the config files so that the client reads it correctly from there. In some cases you may also be able to figure out what socket file location is used by listing the processes: which could output something like 

In MySQL Workbench, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + ENTER to execute the statement at cursor (delineated with semi colons). Is there a similar shortcut in pgAdmin? 

I use RazorSQL as an interface to my PostgreSQL database server, which contains three databases. If I use pgAdmin, I can list all three databases (namely, , , and ): 

I wonder whether I can edit the content of table in the data output of a query in pgAdmin III? The query is a . MySQL Workbench allows users to edit the content of table in the data output of a query, but I fail to see the same option in pgAdmin III. 

I wonder whether there is any way to save the "view data options" in the "edit data" window in pgAdmin III: 

Since there seems to be no way to define such a keyboard shortcut, I filed a feature request: $URL$ , which got rejected: 

is an SQL Reserved Word and is a PL/SQL Reserved Word in Oracle (listed in ). What problems would using them as column names cause in Oracle? The database server runs: 

Is there any point in specifying the precision and scale of (i.e. declaring it instead of simply )? The Oracle documentation advises to specify the precision and scale, as "it provides extra integrity checking on input". But in my case wouldn't the foreign key constraint take care of this integrity checking? 

What could have caused the shared pool to be full? If there's no room left in the SQL area cache, shouldn't older statements be removed? I am running Oracle 11gR2 11.2.0.3. Here are the SQL UPDATE statements I was executing and committing (I know I can optimize them): 

NDB Cluster really is quite fast, with 200 million (NoSQL) QPS reported back in Feb 2015, see MySQL Cluster Benchmarks. What worries me about it is that they're still using those benchmarks now in 2018, as if no progress has been made since 2015. I also get the sense that, for whatever reason, NDB Cluster's popularity is fading compared to Galera and other solutions. (See e.g. the stats for the various tags here on DBA.SE.) 

One solution that could work is a Galera cluster with one node in read-only mode. (See e.g. here for info about geo-distributed Galera cluster.) Galera cluster is a (virtually) synchronous multi-master solution. MariaDB and Percona provide this technology, as does Galera themselves. There is one problem: Since you would be writing to more than one node, there is a higher likelihood of experiencing deadlocks / certification failures, including on commit. (See this article for an explanation.) However, this is something your application could handle if you take care when developing it. Be sure to review the Galera cluster limitations before you decide on this technology. Some of the most notable requirements are: A Linux OS, it only supports the InnoDB storage engine, and all tables must have an explicit primary key. MySQL Group Replication is a similar technology, but this wouldn't be suitable for geo-distributed database nodes as in your use-case. 

mysqldump and mysqlimport (as described by the documentation you cited) should be fine for your regular tables, especially since you don't have any foreign keys. However, due to the differences in MySQL versions, the tables in the database will be different, so I suspect migrating that database probably can't be done with this particular method. If you need to migrate the database, there are better ways of doing that.
