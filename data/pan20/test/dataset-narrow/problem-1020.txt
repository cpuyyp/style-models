I usually delete my questions when I find an answer, if no one has responded. Also, there are many keyboard type questions online, but I did not find anything specific to (not saying these are unique); 

I'd still like to learn a little by fixing this quad-boot. First of all, how do I find out what is wrong? I know the symptoms but gdisk has no complaints... Where do I start? I can only access Linux Mint & Debian (sda6 & sda8) from bootloader (on sda, installed from Debian). Windows (says it's on sda1, but its installed on sda4) just sits and does nothing. If I type exit at grub command line I can go straight to OSX. If I hold down Option key I get OSX, OSX Recovery and Windows, of which only first 2 work. This seems to have started when I had to reinstall my Franken-Debian (well not too bad, just thought it would be easier than fixing it - 2 branches in sources.list is all) (sda8) and now I wonder if I installed it not in UEFI mode... Is this possible? If I select Windows it just sits forever. Here is my partitions; 

I then verified it with . As it turns out, now I have two keys for the character, but I could easily replace the wrong one with the square bracket "]", but I personally don't care about that. I'll wait a while to see if someone wants to post a better answer, but if not, eventually I'll edit this out and mark this answer. 

I'm used to using 'ls' as I would in Linux Mint, e.g. 'ls *.pdf', but in this Debian variant 'ls .pdf' complains. I find myself using a length 'find -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".pdf" -print' instead. Reading this: ls working strangely did not help too much. I do have bash_completions package and I have no weird aliases for 'ls' in my '~/.bashrc' file - I never edit the '/etc/profile' or the global one, wherever it is. Just guessing, I did apply the solution in the linked question but it didn't work. I don't fully understand 'complete' - I guess it is part of 'readline' - so maybe a short explanation would help too (It has no 'man' page). This works though: 'complete -p ls *.pdf', which 'complete --help' says, 

But when I, in grub, , I see the partitions under (hd1,gpt1), (hd1,gpt2), etc. but if I change it it still doesn't work. I know grub notation is a little differnt than grub2, and hd_ seems more grub than grub2, but I am mostly going off what says, and that grub2 is installed on both... update Running off a live Linux Mint cd with wired internet, I installed testdisk and ran it. It seems to only say TestDisk 7.0, Data Recovery Utility, April 2015 Christophe GRENIER $URL$ 

Anyway, following this nice explanation, $URL$ I installed the "Russian, Macintosh" keyboard layout (and all Russian and Ukrainian language support). I then verified the keycode 51 to backslash using . Luckily all I had to do was replace, in , 

The instructions I followed are on my windows partition so I can't say exactly (yet at least) how I did it, but I remember starting with OSX, partitioning everything up ahead, then installing BootCamp/Windows. After that I installed Mint and then finally Debian. Debian has always been my default (master) boot loader and I would like to return to that. I don't want to use rEFIt/rEFInd or Clover or anything else. Journaling and csrutil are disabled for what it is worth... If I mount /dev/disk0s1 under /Volumes/EFI, I see that it looks the same, 

I can access the windows 10 partition from OSX and that seems fine... If I edit the grub command for Windows (Debian's) I see its entry; 

where these two matched - not sure if this is definitive in knowing the real values... I know I could maybe use but I don't think it is necessary (it's kind of a "big gun" right?) The only partition it didn't find was swap - it was just off a little, so I selected "A" to add it in. Don't know the difference between "Linux Swap" or "Linux Swap 2" but I just picked the first one as I usually make temporary swap files myself from either of the 2 linux partitions (I don't bother adding to fstab, etc.). Haven't rebooted yet but has no complaints. Also used an old Win 7 machine to make a recovery USB for the Win 10. Hope that goes smoothly... Update Well that might have been a good thing or not.... Rebooted with a black screen - nothign. So held down option and went to OSX Recovery (OSX would still work, Windows would still not work) and ran from gui - all is good. Ran repair and verify from terminal - an error that could not be fixed - was something about needing more trailing space for the OSX (disk0s2/sda2) partition and wanting to shrink it - failed - despite me enabling journaling etc. Tried this with same outcome from installation media. Figured why not try and work on windows so booted into recovery USB (from the ) and it couldn't fix the "start up" issues. So dropped to and tried and friends. worked, complained of "access denied". So reinstalled from Debian (sda8) onto the front of the disk (sda), checked partitions - they were all in agreement, and effectively back to where I was, along with judicious and ample use of various and friends. I did compile NTFS-3g (wanted the latest in this attempt but did not ) and ran on sda4 (BOOTCAMP) and it said good things; 

Update: I'm using the latest "Fast Ring" version of Windows 10; maybe this is a feature they added recently in this version? 

Disable all antivirus tools (I've had no external tools beside the Windows-built-in, so nothing to do here for me). Follow the instructions in the KB article. 

I've already tried to use Process Monitor to see what's going on but found nothing significant. I can think of: 

This sometimes runs just a few seconds and sometimes significant longer. Since checking for free disk space is to me the equivalent of simply calling which takes about one second maximum, the message seems to be an euphemism for: 

As you can see, above image is a screenshot of the "Run" dialog box which also has the background of the shadow areas left, right and bottom shine through. This is what I would expect: 

Using Alt+Print on the keyboard, a screenshot of the currently active window is copied to the clipboard. Unfortunately, on Windows 10 this also takes the area of the window's shadow into the screenshot: 

Above image is manually modified and omits the shadow areas, showing only the actual window area. What I've tried: I've tried the Snipping Tool and it works as expected, i.e. it does not include the shadow areas. What bothers me is that it is way more complicated to use the Snipping Tool compared to a simple Alt+Print. My question: Is it possible with built-in keyboard shortcuts of Windows 10 to have a screenshot that does exclude the shadow areas? 

Error 0x80070005 in Windows Update when you try to install updates Resolution Error code 0x80070005 is also known as "ACCESS DENIED." It usually occurs when you lack file or registry permissions that are required to install the update. (Because file or registry permissions may be changed by malware, we recommend that you scan for malware after you repair the permissions.) To resolve the issue, make sure that you are logged on as an administrator, and then install the updates again. If the problem continues, use the SubInACL tool to repair file and registry permissions. To do this, follow these steps: 

The KB article shows a script to run, after installing a MSI. I've had to adjust the script since the Windows user group account is named in my German Windows 8.1. After running the adjusted script (for about 10-20 minutes), I've launched the Windows 10 setup again and it ran k. I'm now writing this from my Windows 10 and seem to be happy. Update Since the Microsoft KB article seems to be removed, I've opened the Google Cache version of the KB article and copying the relevant information here. From the KB article: 

Download the SubInACL tool (Mirror), and install it to the default path that is offered by the installer. The default path will be one of the following, depending on your version of Windows: 

This behaviour started right from the beginning, after upgrading Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and never changed even for the latest Fast Ring update. My question: Is there any option/trick to make the history of (successfully) ran commands work again? 

While there might be no general answer for all setups out there that print "Computing space requirements" what they are actually doing, maybe there is a rule-of-thumb. (My example screenshot was taken randomly from Markdown Edit which uses the WiX Toolset) My question: What happens during setup execution when the setup is busy and writes "Computing space requirements"? 

Save the file as Reset.cmd. (Super User note: English download, German download) Right-click the Reset.cmd file in File Explorer (in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8) or Windows Explorer (in Windows 7 and Windows Vista), and then click Run as administrator. In Windows XP, double-click the file in Windows Explorer. Wait until the execution finishes, and then try to install the update again. 

Out of curiosity I've tried Shift+Alt+Print and it works! I.e. when using the Shift key, the shadow area is omitted in the screenshot: 

Initially upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 RTM, I'm using Windows 10 Insider Preview (aka "Fast Ring") for approx. half a year now. Currently, it seems to be way too unstable to me. Therefore I want to use the "regular" Windows 10 again. Everything I found so far was this Microsoft article which basically boils down to using a recovery image. My idea was something easier like e.g. just installing Windows 10 over my current Insider Preview to keep my settings and the like. My question is: What is the recommended way of downgrading from Insider Preview to RTM of Windows 10 while (preferably) keeping my settings? Update: I've ended setting up a new Windows 10. 

but .... update Booted into OSX Installation Media and ran from terminal, and and finally got some "loader" space after my OSX partition - right between OSX & its recovery - not sure how it disappeared... Also backed up partition info with and then converted "hybrid" to "protective" using gdisk, then ran in the running linux OS. Then made sure I could boot from Linux Mint & Mac OSX. Now reinstalling BootCamp and see about doing an "in place" reinstall of windows 10. Already ordered a new computer that will be just for windows - if it wasn't for certain software I need.... Anyways I think I'll close this pretty soon as there is evidently no ideas out there, nor from me either. update Finished the "in place" reinstall of Windows 10. Now both boot successfully (and the OSX recovery) though the recovery complains of a lack of for OSX. This was fixed from the OSX install media - so the only one to blame is Windows 10. I'll try to boot into the Bootcamp Windows Installer, shrink the windows partition, and then fix the loader space with the MacOSX installer again... update So I rand from the BootCamp Windows 10 Installer (had to make the USB drive again from BC - showed up with more 'buttons' this time...oh well) and shrunk the Windows 10 OS partition. Said it would shrink the tail end but I wanted space in front of it so I then booted into a live usb of Gparted and only moved it - effectively putting the space to the front instead of behind. Of course I knew this would probably ruin windows 10 and I could not boot into Win 10, nor could BC Win 10 installation fix it. So I booted into OSX Installation media and ran and from the terminal and, maybe due to the size not changing, I could boot into OSX or Win 10 (alt key) after I set the to Windows. Then I just reinstalled Debian's bootloader, which of course (haha) found Linux Mint. So now it is all back to normal, minus the need to install about 5 hours worth of software - but that will be for a different machine. Need to get comfy with cloning partitions, and maybe whole disks... Will probably close this soon. 

EDIT 2 I tried the two commands above and they work fine - on my OS's partition. The problems are when I move to a different partition, with the working Linux Mint on it and the pdf files I want to modify, that these commands fail. Both partitions are ext4, both have the same username, hostname, UID/GID, permissions, etc. 

I note that the EFI partition seems to have the right code, and starts at sector 40. I'm unsure yet as to whether report about the MBR, header and table are fine - I think so. As Debian was my main bootloader, and I hadn't touched Windows10 in months, I'm hoping to regain bootability of all 4 if maybe I reinstall Debian... After the deepscan in , the 'partitions' listed that cannot be recovered are many, but I do note that the Linux Mint (sda6) partition (for example) that is listed in is also unrecoverable by and "P" says that the filesystem is not supported - so not sure I should trust ...? Update Well I went through with the "deep scan", picking all that were valid (though I'll note it couldn't "read" some of the partitions as it was not supported apparently?) - valid from and another link I found on this site $URL$ 

where astralinuxce is Debian. I have never had luck with BCDedit and I do have this $URL$ on usb, but I would like some guidance before I do anything. I understand linux boot fairly well, but not really windows or OSX... I can repost on pastebin or something the output of the linked software. Booting into OSX, says no problem. I'll note that this is 1.0.3 while the one from Linux Mint install was 1.0.1... But, I do note that and don't agree, though I think that may be normal?? 

and so I wonder if I should permanently apply this 'rule'? using the '-D' flag...? EDIT Just noticed this problem too: 

Seems to not find either linux partition (mint on sda6 or debian on sda8), though the debian bootloader boots either just fine. Running a "deeper search"... I don't understand why doesn't seem to complain, yet does. I should also add some more info I found others had requested from similar problems (my OSX is 10.11.6 on a MacBook Pro 11,3):
