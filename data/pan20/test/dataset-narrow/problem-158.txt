I think you are confusing DTP with PAgP. DTP doesn't have a , while PAgP has . DTP is always on for a switch port unless you turn it off with . The DTP commands are: 

Basically, at this point in time, yes. The door is still open for future types, but I think the whole idea of the routing header was flawed to begin with. Add the fact that some variants of SDN want to do something similar, and I think the idea is dead. I have never thought it a good idea to let end-devices try to dictate the path packets take through the network. Similarly, if you look at QoS, most successful QoS implementations usually overwrite the end-device supplied DSCP value in order to create a comprehensive, consistent QoS solution; everybody wants their traffic marked . 

Your picture shows an improperly terminated cable. The cable sheath is stripped too far back and the pairs are untwisted too far, and the cable is shielded, meaning that you would need connectors and equipment that can use shielded cabling, and your connectors are not shielded. The shield makes up for poor cable performance, but it must be continuous, and grounded, at least, on both ends, otherwise the cable will not perform to specifications. See Shielded and unshielded twisted-pair cable revisited: 

The cable category should be printed on the cable sheath. Just having cable rated at a particular category doesn't mean the cable plant is actually rated at that category. All the components of the cable system must be rated for that category. Also, installation is very important. Even experienced installers have problems with Category-6 cabling. The only way to tell if a particular installation meets a category is to test the cables with an expensive tester that performs all the tests in the test suite for a category. When a cable plant is installed, the installers should test each cable, fix any problems, and provide a complete report to you. 

Two separate VLANs must communicate through a layer-3 device, like a router. Devices on a VLAN communicate with each other using layer-2. Layer-3 must be used to communicate between separate layer-2 domains. Assuming the most common communications (layer-2 is ethernet and layer-3 is IP), when a host on a VLAN wants to communicate with another host on the same VLAN, it discovers the other hosts layer-2 (e.g. MAC) address with something like ARP, and it sends the frame to the MAC address. When a host on one VLAN wants to send something to a host on another VLAN, it must use a layer-3 (e.g. IP) address. The host will use layer-2 to send the frames to its defined gateway (router). The router will strip off the layer-2 frame and inspect the layer-3 packet for the destination layer-3 address. The router will then look up the next hop for the layer-3 address. It will then create a new layer-2 frame for the layer-3 packet based on the layer-2 LAN on the interface where it needs to send the packet for the next hop. Other routers which may be in the path to the end LAN will repeat this process until the frame is placed on the final VLAN, where the receiving host gets the frame. You should search for the OSI model and learn how it works. Just remember that it is a model, and some things in the real world don't necessarily work exactly like the model would predict, but it will give you a gross understanding of how data travel from an application on one host to an application on another host. 

Both 5 Gbps and 8 Gbps are non-standard ethernet speeds, and you won't find those speeds on SFP+s. In fact, you will not find 8 Gbps ethernet at all. If you are using fiber, you will get 10 Gbps, but you must make sure of the fiber and length, which must match the SPF+, which must also match the SFP+ on the other end. Some copper SFP+s can also do 1 Gbps (possibly 100 Mbps and 10 Mbps), besides 10 Gbps. Some switches from members of the NBASE-T Alliance have ports which can do 2.5 or 5 Gbps, besides the standard 10 or 100 Mbps, and 1 or 10 Gbps. It is unlikely that you will find a host NIC that can do either 5 or 8 Gbps. There are server NICs which can do 10 Gbps. 

Routers route between networks, so each router interface needs to be in a different network. Don't be confused by what you think is a home router. The home router has separate networks on the router interfaces, but you are probably meaning a switch module in a home router. You need a switch or a switch module in a router for that, but those are not router interfaces. 

Layer-2 devices like switches an WAPs get IP addresses for management. There are unmanaged switches which don't get, and don't have an option for, IP addresses because they don't need them since they are not managed. Some WAPs (LWAPs) don't get configured with IP address as you normally would, but they get an IP address from DHCP and a configuration from a WLC. You could give these devices IP addresses not on the same network as the network which they serve. This could be a problem since you may not be able to get to the devices to manage them, or it may be that you have set up a management VLAN with which to get to them. Edit: The IP addresses assigned to these devices are not wasted addresses. The devices need to be managed. As I wrote above, you could have a separate management VLAN. If you have so few addresses per subnet, you are really doing it wrong. Each subnet will have a bunch of unused addresses. These addresses could be considered wasted, but it is how IP addresses get assigned. There has been a lot of research and math to demonstrate how you can't, and really shouldn't, have a very efficient IP address scheme. This is one of the reasons IPv6 was designed the way it is with over 18 quintillion addresses per subnet. 

Spanning tree itself doesn't have anything like what you are asking. As the network designer, you assign the priorities to ensure that the correct bridge becomes the root bridge. How you select which bridge should be the root depends on how you want the traffic to flow, and that is up to you as the network designer. If the majority of your traffic is kept within the LAN, then, yes, you should pick the bridge closest to the center of the LAN. If most of your traffic exits the LAN, then you should pick the bridge where your router is connected. You design the LAN topology to fit how your LAN will be used. 

No, DHCP offers can be sent as unicast or broadcast. The layer-3 address doesn't really matter if it is unicast or broadcast because the frame is being delivered on the LAN by the layer-2 address. From RFC 2321, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (emphasis mine): 

Broadcasts are stopped at a layer-3 boundary (router). An example of a broadcast is an ARP request where a host is looking for the MAC address of the owner of an IP address. The host sends a broadcast asking, "Who owns this IP address?" Broadcasts are received and processed by every host in the layer-2 domain. A multicast is received and processed by hosts which subscribe to the multicast group of the multicast. It is an elective "broadcast". Many things use multicast, including some routing protocols. An example of multicasting is an IPTV application which some companies use. Multicasts are normally stopped at a layer-3 boundary (router) unless the router is configured for multicast routing, which is a large topic which cannot be adequately addressed here. Since broadcasts are stopped at a layer-3 boundary, and multicasts only traverse layer-3 when all the routers in the path are configured to do multicast routing, broadcasts and multicasts cannot traverse the Internet, which is why all your internet traffic will be unicasts. By the way, IPv6 has eliminated broadcasts; there is no such concept in IPv6. IPv6 makes heavy use of multicasts. You may also see the term anycast used a lot in IPv6, but IPv4 can use anycasting, too. Anycasts are really unicasts, so the unicast rules and concepts apply to anycasts. 

With IPv4, a computer doesn't really know about a router. A host will have a configured gateway, to which it will send any traffic destined for a different network. The gateway is probably a router, but not necessarily. The gateway is either manually configured, or assigned via DHCP. The host doesn't have a configured gateway until one is either manually or dynamically assigned. That means that it cannot communicate to a different network until one is assigned. On the other hand, IPv6 has added ND (Neighbor Discovery), and part of ND includes RAs (Router Advertisements). Routers can be configured to advertise their existence, and the local network prefix. This allows IPv6 hosts to configure themselves without DHCP, although there is a version of DHCP for IPv6.
