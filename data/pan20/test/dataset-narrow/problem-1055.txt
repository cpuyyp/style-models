I've been reading articles about high framerate displays, about how some of them cheat and don't actually work at 120/144hz, and also about software that seemingly fixes those problems. Most software just sets the framerate from 60, as it was before the new display was connected, to whatever maximum it now has. Above that I've found some info on increasing graphics card update rate. Supposedly it should improve perceived update rate on a display that doesn't support as many fps as the tool would say it shows. For example, people say that 74hz on a 60hz display looks smoother than before. I can't objectively test it myself, and I don't know much about the technicalities of that. How truthful is that? Is it just the placebo effect, or is there some sort of non-v-sync'ed tearing from converting 74 frames down to 60 which seems smoother? 

In the end I didn't find an image viewer that perfectly suits my preferences, so I created my own with XNA. 

This seems to be a pre-boot options menu. It appears most likely either because you have an installation media such as a USB drive with Windows 10 on it plugged in or a DVD in the optical drive, and the computer is set up to load from them first. It should not appear if you take them out before starting up. Or it could be because you have done a compression and this got added as an additional boot option. In this case you can remove it after booting into Windows and pressing WinKey(to the right of the left Ctrl)+R, and typing in . That should open a window like this: 

I heard that dual-cpu motherboards are quite expensive and not all cpus can work in dual-cpu mode, but I don't know much else. Does it make sense to spend money on a desktop computer with 2 processors, or is it more appropriate to buy 1 powerful modern cpu and an ordinary motherboard? I'm a gamer and a game developer, and I like my PCs fast, but I don't know which option here is faster, and what is the difference in costs. I'm not asking for shopping recommendation, but approximate price/performance numbers would be nice. 

I like listening to music, but the one thing I can't get with the mobile devices (players, smartphones, notebooks) is the volume and clarity I get from my desktop pc audio card. It's nothing special, the cheapest PCI-E x1 Sound Blaster card, but somehow it sounds a lot better. I have tried listening to external audio cards and their sound is comparable, but they are a lot more expensive, to the point that I can't really think of it as a great value. So I'd like to try and find a way to make internal PCI-E audio cards mobile. Does there exist a common method to mobilize internal PCI-E devices? Perhaps some controller with only the required interfaces and power cables? If not, what does it take to turn a PCI-E audio card into USB-powered mobile version? Again, I'm looking for reasonably prices solutions, but if there are only the expensive ways, I'd still like to know about them. 

UPDATE 2: Today, we attempted the following, to no avail: -Used a working Windows 7 computer to open the regedit and exported a hive file for the System subkey and saved it on a USB drive. -Used the recovery command prompt on the broken PC to open a temporary regedit (not the real one for the hard drive), and used Import just to navigate in File Explorer. We copied the hive file (use the name SYSTEMhome just so it would be unique) from a USB drive to the hard drive's Windows/System32/config folder. -Returned to the temporary regedit, selected HKLM, and loaded SYSTEMhome as a hive. -Exported the temporary regedit's SYSTEM hive and saved it to the hard drive's Windows/System32/config folder. -Returned to the temporary regedit, selected the SYSTEMhome hive inside the HKLM key, and Imported the SYSTEM hive from the config folder. This produced a warning that it would overwrite the SYSTEMhome subkey, and we said OK. This resulted in a kind of merger of the information within the temp regedit's SYSTEM subkey with the SYSTEMhome subkey we added, without affecting the SYSTEM subkey still listed in the regedit. -Unloaded the SYSTEMhome subkey so that the merged hive file saved to the hard drive's config folder, and the temporary regedit was left as we found it. -Used the Import function to access File Explorer in order to delete the original SYSTEM hive file we exported from the temporary regedit. -Renamed the newly “merged” SYSTEMhome hive file to SYSTEM, so that Windows would recognize it as a registry file. -Restarted the computer, hoping the system would see the SYSTEM hive file and be able to boot. No luck. Any more ideas out there? Can you load a .reg file into a hive (at the same level as SYSTEM, SOFTWARE, etc.) so that it stands on its own instead of merging into an existing hive (or is there some way to create an empty hive that doesn't involve scripting in Power Shell, so that we could import the .reg file into that)? The native partitioning on the broken PC is different than that of the good Windows 7 PC on which we created the SYSTEM hive file, so we’re wondering if that partition numbering is interfering in the boot efforts. We can edit it as .reg, but then don’t have a way to convert it back to .reg. 

UPDATE 1: I thought I deleted the full HKLM, but a teammate recalled we weren't able to do so and instead deleted just the System subkey within HKLM. This bears out, now that we are able to access the regedit on the hard drive. Still, the same issue remains. Is there a way to extract just part of a .reg file? Maybe if we could get just the HKLM System subkey, we could import that since it wouldn't be trying to overwrite the rest of the registry. Or is there a third-party tool that can merge a .reg file into the registry? I've been looking, but only find tools to create .reg files and then use the regedit to import, which we've tried but can't accomplish. 

It will kill all executables starting with that name, so make sure you don't just type something like because that could obviously kill critical processes like . Also, the flag is for killing the tree of processes, which is the target process and all the child processes it spawned. It may not be necessary most of the time. 

Firefox keeps asking me if I still want to open a file type with a certain program, even though the checkbox that says is checked. This window always pops up for this type of file. This has been an issue for me for several years and with different versions of Firefox. I'm talking about a dialog window like this, but with different file type and options: 

The total number of cores in both configs is 8 and that's twice as many as in the base config, so my guess is their performance is supposed to be 200% of base config, but then I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to make a decent guess. Price is not my concern in this question, I just want to know how the performance changes if the total cpu core number increase is done within and outside a single processor. My personal interest lies in gaming and game development. I don't know about other games, but my own games I try to make multithreaded, so they could take advantage of all those cpu cores on my pc. 

By default, in Windows 7 start menu the item "Documents" opens a library containing current user's documents folder and public documents. I'd like to change that behavior to open current user's documents folder. How do I do that? 

Firefox 29.0a2 (Aurora, 2014-02-08) is out now and it has this terribly small drag area that in my case is almost fully covered with bookmarks and the green area is where you must precisely place the cursor to drag the window: 

old solution using AutoIt Note: this solution may cause stuttering and occasional freezes on older CPUs or at full CPU load. I whipped up an AutoIt script which detects the cursor within the notes list area and if you scroll up or down, makes a click on the "up" and "down" buttons on the scrollbar. This works with multiple OneNote windows. You don't have to have focus on the window for the scroll to work, just hover over that list: 

New, much simpler solution using AutoHotKey I've been looking for a way to avoid freezes caused by constant checks for the active window and also an overall simpler code solution. Here's what I made: 

Is there a (semi-)standard Unix command that would sleep until the time specified on its command line? In other words, I am looking for something similar to that would take wakeup time rather than duration. For example: I can code something up but would rather not re-invent the wheel if there's already something out there. Bonus question: it would be great if it could take the timezone (as in ). edit Due to the nature of what I am doing, I am looking for a "sleep until T" rather than "run command at T" solution. edit For the avoidance of doubt, if I run the command at 18:00 and tell it to wake up at 17:00, I expect it to sleep for 23 hours (or, in some corner cases having to do with daylight savings time, for 22 or 24 hours.) 

I have a new Windows 7 PC that wouldn't sleep (not just automatically, but also when specifically told to). The screen goes black momentarily, but within two seconds the machine comes back as if nothing has happened. I tried . This produces some errors quoted at the bottom of this post, plus some warnings about timer resolution. There are no USB devices connected other than wireless keyboard + mouse (Logitech MK250); I tried unplugging them to no effect. The motherboard is Asus P7P55D-E. says "Wake History Count - 0", which I take to mean that it never actually went to sleep. I dual boot into Ubuntu, and was having exactly the same problem on the Linux side. That turned out to do with USB 3.0, which I've now disabled in the BIOS. This has solved the problem on the Ubuntu side of things, but made no difference to Windows 7. Any suggestions? 

Is there any way to find out which device/event caused Ubuntu (10.10) to wake up from the most recent sleep/hibernation? I am trying to troubleshoot some sleep issues on a new box, and knowing what's causing it to wake up would help. I did check but all it seems to say is 

I have a workflow whereby I scan paper documents into searchable PDFs using a Fujitsu ScanSnap S500 document scanner. I am not a great fan of the bundled software, but it's dead simple to use: place a stack of paper at the top, push the green button and a searchable PDF comes out. Now, I'd like to do something similar on Linux (Ubuntu 10.10). The scanner is supported out of the box. I've looked at and : 

Something broke with the method I've been using until today, so I looked up a new solution and this addon seems to be working: $URL$ 

Press T and the Options window that isn't affected by this glitch will show up! Now you can go to "Advanced" tab and toggle "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" and just in case "Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts on screen": 

The whole bar became a solid color, which didn't seem to be the average color of the whole bar. Pink, light-green and turquoise were prevalent, with much rarer brownish-tan and purple. Yellow only seems to occur right after the index becomes greater than 256. The weird thing is this persisted even after reloading uTorrent application and rebooting the PC. After the download completed, availability index lowered to 14 and the bar returned to normal. Naturally, I wanted to check things out again, so I deleted data and re-downloaded the torrent to see if this keeps happening. It does. Is this a bug or an intended feature? If so, what do these colors signify? 

I recently installed Google Drive on my Windows 7 PC to move and delete some files with better interface (through Windows Explorer) by dragging files between folders and mass-deleting, and my Windows 7 already asks me once if I'm sure about deleting those files, but it doesn't prevent Google Drive from popping up its own prompt asking the same question. And there isn't a checkbox for disabling that in Google Drive's settings window. How do I disable Google Drive's own delete prompt? 

I noticed that a certain torrent, which was the last one in the torrent list, had a strangely colored availability bar. After exceeding the magical number 256, the bar weirds out. Color of the bar changed each time the last torrent was selected. I grabbed a number of screenshots from which I cut only the rightmost fragment of it along with the current availability index: 

This is what I ended up doing for myself: I took the font file from and edited all its emoji symbols to contain the "not defined" symbol at the very end of the Unicode range. Using FontForge editor, I copied it and pasted over all the emoji symbols (), and installed it as a system font, and gave it a unique name so it could be used in Firefox as a custom installed font (as described in the other answer here) and now every emoji symbol is a square. You could use an empty space symbol instead if you want, but then you won't be able to see where an emoji is expected to be, and it might be a bit confusing.
