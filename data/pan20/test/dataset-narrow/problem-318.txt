If you already have objects that require public to the table then you can add the following for each existing table: 

You should now be able to drop the filegroup's logical file and the filegroup itself. Open Transactions If you really don't have a file (logical_name / pyhsical_file_name) associated with the filegroup you are trying to delete, then performing a transaction log backup might release any transactions hindering further deletion of the filegroup. Dial 911 If all else fails, you might want to consider opening a call with Microsoft. 

The root cause is the DMF in conjunction with the Scanning Modes and heaps. (My emphasis on the LIMITED portions of the original description) 

This is not a bug, but the way the optimizer was developed to perform, as was explained by Timour Katchaounov on the 28th February 2005: 

...you will see that the index is well and truly not used. In the documentation for the EXPLAIN command here 9.8.2 EXPLAIN Output Format they write for the Extra information that: 

Objects created The solution is deployed as one script named , which itself will create stored procedures, tables and jobs . Following is a list of objects that are created: Table 

A detailed explanation can be found here: Report Embedded Datasets and Shared Datasets (Report Builder and SSRS) There are some limitation in Report Designer: 

So if you read in the documentation that a parameter is only valid on server start, then you need a restart. Otherwise a reload should be sufficient. 

I have seen cases where rebuilding the indexes in parallel (or without specifying MAXDOP) can cause fragmentation. Try rebuilding the index with the option . ALTER INDEX (Transact-SQL) This will result in the rebuild jobs taking longer, but it might help to reduce fragmentation. If you are using the Standard Edition, then the index will be unavailable until it has been rebuilt. On Enterprise you can specify the ONLINE = ON parameter to reduce the impact. I have observed this on heavily used database servers. 

I'm trying to figure out various things surrounding PostgreSQL and how backups should work together with WAL and Commvault Simpana. Simpana is telling me that everything is ok, but leaves files lying around in the WAL Archive directory. Let the journey begin. Environment PostgreSQL & OS Version PostgreSQL 9.3 is running on an Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS server. Postgres WAL Config The postgres.conf file is set as follows for WAL archiving. 

Reference: Snapshot Backups (Microsoft Technet) A backup created using this feature can also be restored almost instantaneously. Summary The 3rd-party backups should be marked as and . These backups will not conflict with additional backup steps/procedures performed using native SQL Server , and statements. The 3rd-party database backups are not part of an existing backup set. Answering your questions The vendor stated correctly, that during the (quick) snapshot backup, that other backups should not run. 

Recommendations User objects shouldn't be stored in the master database as explained in the following articles. 

Ensure the name of the schema you are importing with the parameter is indeed . If not insert the correct schema name. Please verify that the name used for the parameter is and not for example (Relevant if you are on a Linux OS) Quotes are not usually required when adding parameters. In some cases you might have to escape the quotes as pointed out by other answers. Oracle recommends: 

This will attach the xxx.mdf and xxx.ldf files to your SQL Server instance as database xxx. You could then rerun the above query to find information about the database. Detaching a database After you have found the relevant information you could then detach the database again by running the following query: 

Reference: SQL Server Backup (from ola.hallengren.com) This means that if you don't have a recent FULL or DIFF backup, then the parameter will have no effect. All the Transaction Log backups will be kept on disk, even though the has passed. You might want to check if your FULL, DIFF and TLOG backups are consistent and available on disk. It is important to have all files available. sequence available. Example of Files on Disk Assuming it is Friday 3.30pm (what a coincidence) you should find the following files in your backup folder if everything is set up correctly: (I have put a separator between the FULL and DIFF backups) 

This goes on and on until all the prerequisites are met, so that your desired package can be installed. Your question 

In response to your comment: You might have to switch the SID and run the query for each SID in order to determine which database files names have already been used. You can't have the same database file (name) for a different SID and a different tablespace in the same directory. Possible Solutions 

As you can see in this example the LSN of the TLOG backups always match up. The of a previous TLOG backup matches the of the next TLOG backup. However, the FULL backup has an LSN that begins inside the LSN range of the next TLOG backup and ends inside the LSN range of the same TLOG backup. Restore based on your example table If you were required to restore your database to 18:00 because of an error at 19:00 then you would require the FULL backup from 12:00 and your Transaction Log backups from 13:00 through 18:00. The LSNs would be without interruptions. No need for the 3rd-party FULL Backup. You can verify this by checking the and column of your current backups. They should match each other. End of Explanation You could end the explanation here and now, but there are considerations to be made regarding the 3rd-party solution and the solution you are using for your backups.

Reference: .MDMP File Extension (fileinfo.com) If you have a Microsoft debugger and the symbols for the relevant progams, then you can have a look at the dump file yourself: 

It's nice to know that SQL Server has everything nice and tied up, but what does that share actually do? Is it the so called "file system filter driver"? Seeing as any authenticated user can access the "share", what are the security implications? Is the Device RsFx0320 a predecessor to the resilient file system format that was introduced with Windows Server 2012? 

Of course, you could omit the search predicate and enjoy the information overflow of the 2072 objects found in a SQL Server 2014 instance: 

Mark's previous endeavours into finding internal information led through detaching the database and using a HEX editor to find the string of the procedure . Then using the HEX offset to calculate the ID of the page and then via to the reveal the of the item he was searching for which in this case is then . From there he retrieves the data from fist via the statement: 

This will link the Windows Authenticated SQL Server Login to an existing SQL Server Database User. 3. Drop the Existing Windows Authenticate SQL Server Login and Recreate If you require the user's name to be the same as what you previously defined as your Windows Authenticated SQL Server Login, then you will have to drop SQL Serer Login and re-create it, but without the backslash. This user can then be linked to the database. 4. Login Issues If the reason for wanting to switch from a Windows Authenticated SQL Server Login to a SQL Server Authenticated SQL Server Login is login issue, then you might want to consider starting the program with the Windows Account that has access to the database, which will then allow you to connect to the database. To achieve this follow these steps: 

3. Verify the setting SQL Script Verify that your instance is running in SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode by issuing the following command: 

This can be verified by querying the and tables and checking the column of the table. If the column contains a and the step finishes, then it will quit the job and report a failure (Quit the job reporting failure). Query Job History and Steps Here is a script for your convenience to query the job steps and history: 

So if the application is using COMPUTE or COMPUTE BY, then this will be no longer work in SQL Server 2016 as it was removed in SQL Server 2014. The list of discontinued features from SQL Server version to SQL Server version varies.
