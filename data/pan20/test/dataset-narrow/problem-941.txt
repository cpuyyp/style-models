USB error -110 means power exceeded, the computer sys could not provide enough power for the pendirve to operate. Thus the device can not provide any data i.e device descriptor thus the computer cannot identify it. Your motherboard is probably not getting enough power, or too many devices connected. Unplug everything and unplug the computer from wall for ~3 min for Mb to drain. Restart and try again with absolute minimal things plugged in. Is anything obvious standing out? I.e. 180V Mains on a 240V Computer? Dirty USB connection pins? Else try a friends computer with USB 3.0, I know some USB 3.0 Pendrives cannot run on USB 2.0 ports. just not enough power.

Or it could be the fact that during dns register, chrome's download meter counter is reset When you start a download, the dns service is called to map the address to the download server. Subsequent packets of data (the downloading file) do not have any dependencies on the dns. Even unlimited connections are limited in some way, each node on a network has a limit threshold that several users combine to meet. Else the internet will be cluttered and slow, with sharp lag spikes during peak times. It is possible that calling a dns refresh messes with the limiter, but it doesn't make any sense. End recommendation, try this again but use win network manager as the monitor. 

This looks like a standard LVDS (low voltage differential signalling) connector, commonly used for laptop LCD screens. In which case, replacements can be found on-line. The only thing is to buy a cable that will fit in your laptop. Length does not have to be exact, but its always better to have a longer cable than one that is too short. You can't cut and splice these effectively, not without good expensive tools anyway.. According to the specs you will be looking for a 40pin 2CH 6-Bit LVDS cable. I would like you to post up pictures of both connections on the cable, to confirm that it is not a proprietary socket (highly doubt it as it's not apple). LINKS: For two different types of motherboard connections. One is split for power 

The gradient grey makes me think the LCD is bad (or a cracked/shorted LVDS cable). The hard shut-down is a solid indicator that you've got a serious hardware issue. i would try starting in safe mode (boot and hold the SHIFT key until you've got the apple and the "grey grinding wheel").... IF the unit will boot in safe mode then its MORE LIKELY the GPU chip (logic board) than the LCD. Either way, (LCD or logic board), I'd not put any money into this system - it's well beyond its prime and I'd very heartily recommend an upgrade.. The logic boards are known for failure... There is NO separate "power supply" in this era system - if it's got a power system issue, it would be on board the logic board, in which case you need to say a prayer and bury it. 

one of my businesses does a lot of customized Mac work, and we upgrade 50-60 Macs per week. Primarily SSD and SSHD drives, ram, stripping Mac OSs down for best performance, etc. We've NEVER ONCE had any issue with any Samsung SSD with TRIM. not a single time. nada... The gained performance is noticeable as well.. pretty powerful. I wouldn't give it a second thought.... we install it on every SSD. 

Basically, ANY change you make (other than perhaps doing a drive verification) is risking a full erasure of a drive. I work on drives for a living, and I don't play with them unless I've got a full backup. 

a better choice of antennae may help you - - can you arrange your router for either 180 degree or more narrow directionals? if so, you can physically overcome much of the encroachment by simply tuning your system to a better transmission window... 

I'm trying to get a taste for what the best options are (or what the trade-offs are) if I want to encrypt at least /var, /home, /tmp, /etc, and swap (think that pretty much covers most sensitive data, assuming I'm not installing secret applications into /usr or anything). Some guiding questions: 

I realize there are previous discussions on disk encryption in Linux but they tend to only cover subsets of the above options and questions. Thanks for any guidance. 

Yesterday I installed doctormo's PPA package of the Wacom drivers to get a new Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch working on my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS laptop, as instructed here and dozens of other web pages. Things were working fine, but today things broke. Some symptoms: 

In an ssh session, one can start tunneling with the keystrokes and entering (e.g.) . However, is there any way to stop tunneling on that port (short of killing the process)? 

I've read several of the other questions here and other pages on the web, but so far nothing I've tried has worked. The video I'm trying to cache for offline viewing is this lecture: $URL$ I've tried: 

In some Chrome instances, several extensions (apps?) called Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc. are installed (I've seen various subsets of these across different Chrome instances). What are these for / what do they do / why do they exist? I verified that I can go offline and use Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc. just fine with these extensions disabled. 

I'm looking for a way to do this from the command line. Totem has no problem just playing the stream, so I assume a way to dump the stream to a file is not out of reach, but I can't figure it out. Anybody else able to record this? Thanks in advance. Update: I was wrong on one data point - if I enable transcoding in VLC, the resulting file is playable (just have to wait for the whole thing to complete - it was the partial recording that was not playable). However, I'm still interested in a command-line approach to this problem, so that I can batch up many lectures. 

Simple answer is NO, RAM will not affect speed of small files being written. Complex answer is: DEPENDS on how much data is being written at any given time. If more than ~ 4GB? (estimate based on system taking up 4 GB) at any given moment (high I/O count) then you will benefit from the increased RAM due to the write buffer being used more intensely. $URL$ Computer Science: Data is written to the RAM while a write to disk is requested. File copy may finish, but the operating system will continue flushing data from RAM to disk. This answer is written with Linux in mind. A faster speed will be achieved in your case with: 

You can simply download the files you need through their website and it won't remember you. also this is maybe useful: To "forget" your account on your machine -- right click the Dropbox icon in the task tray --> Preferences --? Account --> Unlink This Computer. (SnakeDoc.) 

Quick fix: Startup chrome with this flag: Pop into the shortcut for running chrome and append that flag to the target like the image below: 

The USB 3.0 plug is significantly different from a USB 2.0 Plug. If you look into the USB 3.0 Plug, on the back-end roof of the plug head, there are 5 extra data transfer pins. When the pins are engaged, USB 3.0 Protocol is activated. Obviously the USB 2.0 lacks these extra pins, when it connects USB 2.0 is defaulted having no register of the 5 extra pins. Your Blue Snowflake by all means should work with Windows 8(.1) on a USB 3.0 Hub. Helpful diagrams can be found at this source (page 8): $URL$ 

VPN to your asterisk server - the best 'safe' route. Bear in mind that allowing an asterisk box to be 'open' to the web is NOT a good idea. Search for "$10,000 VOIP phone bill" if this is unclear to you... Can your router VPN onto your server's network? If you don't have access to either VPN or port forwarding on the remote server's end, there's really not a good alternative for a safe connection setup. 

first, if you've just deleted it, chances are the file is still on your hard drive. you need to IMMEDIATELY do a check for Unerase of recently deleted files. And DO NOT SAVE ANYTHING NEW TO THIS DRIVE!!! "Deleted" files aren't actually deleted.. The drive directory has simply been modified to remove their 'location' tabs, and the associated space is now free for use again.. So as soon as you save another file, it may overwrite that area, at which point your chances of getting those files back decrease exponentially. Using a high quality app like FileSalvage or DiskDrill, you can unerase those drives.. howevr, you can't install it on that drive (due to the fact that installation or running that drive may well overwrite the files)... SO. you need to NOT run that machine; shut it down and boot it only in Target Disk mode, then do a recovery from another machine.. This takes time, but it's one of the consequences of deleting something that you needed. If you have a TimeMachine drive, you can probably go to that drive and recover it via Time Machine. 

I can help with that! =) Here's my bat file code that i run regularly. Tell me what u want and i can customize the netsh part =) This is a windows only solution and just requires you to copy paste code into a txt file and change the ".txt" part (show extensions must be enabled in view) to ".bat" 

It's fairly easy to setup a system wide vpn using tailored commercial software. Just download, setup, input login, and start vpn. Downside is that you have to pay. Most vpn's have easy to understand instructions. More generalized 'free' versions are slightly harder to setup such as OpenVPN. It's important to use a vpn provider that you can trust, as snippets of internet activity and info can be picked up at the emerging end of the vpn. Therefore it is wise to review the community standing of the vpn before purchasing it. Using a free vpn can be more often than not, risky, compared to paid vpn's. A good reasonably priced, and fast, easy to use, secure vpn which I have used for 1 year is: Private internet access, though I use it on windows. It is worth mentioning that this VPN provider is not stable on my iPhone and iPad (possibly because they use LT2P protocol), however the client software should be fine on your mac. 

You are right on track! Create the sys image before the grace period is over, and input key on each separate comp. Not familiar with Acronis Truimage, but should work! Sysprep is not limited to 3 comps, in fact it is designed to be used for your explicit purpose! SysP Info can be found here: $URL$ The security identifier only kicks in when the system is activated or trial expired. So it should be fine even with a standard unlicensed backup iso.

I currently share my screen for presentations using VNC, since it's easy to share with anyone who has little more than a web browser with noVNC. Is there a similar viewer (HTML5, Flash, or - as a last resort - Java) that uses the faster NX protocol? The only NX clients I can find today are "full" clients, which require a download/install and have no view-only mode. 

I have a machine (hostname ) with two wired network interfaces, eth0 and eth1. When I connect another host to one of them (eth0), I can see in either one's NetworkManager that it's using "Link-Local Only" mode: 

I'm considering encrypting the contents of my laptop, which runs Ubuntu 10.04 and has an ext4 + swap, and I'm wondering what the best options are here. I'm aware of: 

Turned out that it was due to a missing /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-wacom.conf, which was removed in a packaging screw-up in an update from just a few days ago. After adding in the one from $URL$ everything worked again. Thanks go to Favux. 

This works great—I can instantly communicate between the two hosts just with or . However, as soon as I plug in a second host onto eth1, and become unreachable to each other, due to now having multiple overlapping 169.254.0.0/16 routes. How do I fix this permanently, such that I don't need to repeat some incantations on each host every time I connect a host, and also minimize the amount of static IP configuration I have to do (I'd like to solve this in the most ZeroConfNetworking-ish way possible)? FWIW all machines are running Ubuntu 12.04.
