if you have cron jobs running, just set up daily automatic reboot -- this should restart your software every 24hours, that's within your 60hr running limit. you might lose about 5-10seconds worth of data, though. 

it's not like you log in to your raspberry from random computers in inet cafes and libraries? then, from my point of view, you should generate RSA keypair on your computer: 

I don't think any SD card can beat this, also SD cards are prone to corruption, therefore I'd advise against using them for storage of any files you don't want to lose eventually. for raspi-based HDD file storage you should expect speeds about 7-8MB/s with the correct network setup, and the main speed limiter is the speed of 100M ethernet. 

you may use "--warning=no-timestamp" to skip the timestamp check and allow full extraction of your archive (see $URL$ for details). however, that kind of error usually happens with corrupt archives, you'd better double check if all MD5/SHA checksums are correct and if your /boot folder really has files with very outdated time stamps. 

if you need a working linux with all man pages included, why don't you get another SD card and install Raspbian there? RaspBMC is very stripped/limited, and I would not even think about using is as a general purpose linux. 

By plugging wifi adapter you most probably overloaded your power supply. Please, check the rating of your power adapter, should be 5V / 2A or more. 

Basically, it's a board you connect to the RaspberryPi to get some extra functionality, like communucation ports, LEDs, HW clock and more (read RasPiComm technical specs for details). What do you need to use it? -- well, you need RaspberryPi with power supply and SD card to boot from and, basically, RasPiComm itself. Or maybe you don't need RasPiComm -- I don't know, that depends on what's your purpose -- probably you need a completely different setup altogether. What do you need to make it work? -- connect all connectors, insert SD card, attach power and see what happens. If there's no smoke -- it works, if there's a smoke -- disconnect the power and try to find the cause. Please, don't inhale, may be hazardous for your health. Any software you need for it? -- obviously, the browser, preferably Mozilla or Chrome, to read the plethora of online pages with the information pertaining to RaspberryPi and RasPiComm. 

copying the screen will most likely not work well. the best approach would be to share the folder with the movies using NFS or SAMBA and access it from Pi to read the contents and play it on the TV screen. still, 1080p movies might play choppy during the action scenes because of wifi speed not being fast enough to support the necessary bandwidth. you might need to use the wired ethernet as the last resort. 

your browser is requesting your scripts while reading main .html file, hence the other 4 new processes (note, request to fonts.google.com does not result in the new process started). it's a typical behaviour, you should not be worried about that. 

if you want to be able to find where is +5V, GND, TX and RX pins, you need a multimeter (a voltmeter basically), 1kOhm resistor and a simple LED. first you need to find the GND and +5V, most probably these are BLACK and RED, however might be any colour. connect multimeter to the GND and touch other pins starting from RED, once you see 5V on your multimeter, you've found the power pins. if you don't see 5V on the multimeter, choose another pin as GND, and measure voltage between the selected pin and other pins. repeat as necessary. then you may try to find the TX pin. make a probe, according to the picture: 

you need only one resistor, same value you use when connecting a single color LED, it may be on the either side, this does not matter. just keep in mind, the GPIO pins cannot source a lot of current, you'd better keep it within 10mA (or lower) to be safe. I'd start with a 2k2 resistor and then go lower if you need additional brightness, but don't go below 500ohm. 

You have to work out a compromise, depending on how far is your greenhouse and how much data you need to get. For once-a-minute temperature/humidity readings you'd be perfectly fine. 

download raspbian copy image to SD boot your Pi install LAMP shutdown create an image from SD PROFIT!? 

you may easily recreate any user by connecting your SD card to any linux computer where you have root access, then edit , and files to add the corresponding line. you may even use your RasPi for that purpose, provided you have another SD card to boot from and USB SD card reader to insert the broken one into the USB slot. 

I would definitely recommend to get $5 power adapter from the authorized Raspberry Pi resellers instead. UPDATE: R1/R10 may have been introduced into this schematics to raise output voltage from 5V to 5.25V, still I would strongly advise against using them, firstly because your Pi is not designed to handle 5.25V -- 5V would be perfectly enough, and secondly because using these resistors will introduce constant leak current about 5V/340ohm=15mA for no particular reason. If you need voltage adjustment there are different voltage regulators with dedicated adjustment pin that do not require small resistors/large leak currents. 

There's a Raspberry Pi security tutorial based on ArchLinux, that includes step 13 "Snort installation". Basically all you have to do is: 

The answer is both "Yes" and "No". Yes, because the executable code obviously could be run straight from the SD card (Raspberry Pi firmware reads the bootloader from the SD card), and it's very possible to create your own bootloader and copy it to the SD card. On the other hand, it's No, because 1) your tutorial build system does not produce the code, that can be used as a bootloader, you will need a different set of libraries/make files and 2) the process of writing bootloader to the SD card is much more involving and generally unsafer, than copying the kernel.img file. Overall, using SD card without writing a Linux image there first is possible, but considering that it takes only about 2-3 minutes, it's just not worth the trouble. 

There are serial LCDs available from SparkFun, that allow the output using only 1 (ONE) control pin besides POWER and GND. Inexpensive and easy to use. And 5V TTL input means you may connect it directly to the Raspberry Pi and it should work just fine (or you may order 3.3V version).
