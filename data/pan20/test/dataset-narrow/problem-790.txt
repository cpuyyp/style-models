NTP is normally very quiet/silent in syslog. Things are going wrong if it shows up. If your hardware clock is working, it shouldn't need to modify your clock during startup. With the right settings it can replace ntpdate to set the clock on startup if required. The logs you want to look at are the and files. Once running NTP should not need to synchronize the clock. It will adjust the tick timing very slightly to keep the clock synchronized. file provides your local state, while shows your state relative to the servers you are using. See the NTP Troubleshooting Guide for details on these files. 

The system I am on uses for certificates and for keys. Protection on the directory is 710. Root owns the directory and the group can only access keys if it knows their name. Careful use of groups and permissions can provide finer grain access to the keys by non-root users. EDIT: As @UtahJarhead pointed out SSH is not SSL(TLS). SSH doesn't normally have any issues about key placement as they are placed by the tools. Both methods can be used to secure access. SSL/TLS uses CA (Certficate Authority) signed certificates stored as specified above. SSH uses unsigned certificates. The server's (host's) keys are stored in /etc/ssh and the key has 600 permission allowing only root read access. These are generated and installed when the daemon is installed . Client/user keys are stored in ~/ssh (aka $HOME/ssh) and all the standard tools will place them accordingly. When a public key is copied for passwordless access it also is stored in ~/ssh for the target user on the target system. 

I define the interface on the virutal machine in using a static address. The virtual machine will need to be defined with an ethernet interface. A device created on the server for the virtual machine. The interface should appear on the server as up with no addresses defined. The device will appear as an type interface on the vm. If the above output is for your server, the address on your server should be fine for the virtual machine. on the server should have whatever address is required for external access. You should also have a device which I don't see. EDIT: I also shutdown the autostart of the network by virsh. This is the /etc/network/initerfaces definition for one of my bridges. I updated my dhsmasq configuration accoringly. 

Check your logs on Domain2. Also check Domain1 logs to see if they are rejecting messages. They should tell you why traffic is being rejected. Here are a few steps to get things working. 

The System restart required is likely a result of a kernel patch being applied. A restart to use the new kernel is required. This is unrelated to the java process problem, but will likely resolve the problem temporarily. As the PPID (parent PID) is 1 for the Java process, they are not threads. It is possible you have a command in your profile to start this application, although as it runs a user padmin, this may not be likely. A search for linux padmin java, gives a number of different possible application which may be running. The lsof command can be used to try to find out where these were started from. Then you can try to configure out what application is running. 

Make sure the .ht* files are readable by the web server. I test unauthorized access by changing the user id in the file to one I haven't used. 

If you don't provide your mail server name(s), you won't get much in the way of expert help. Temporary blocks are common for your first email to a recipient from a server. Barring rules that bypass greylisting for your server, servers using greylisting will temporarily reject your messages. However, this should be with 450 (temporary) rejection rather than a 550 (permanent) rejection. If you are too agressive at retrying, you may trigger the receiving server to locally blacklist your server. It is possible that you managed to get onto local blacklists when you were first setting your server up. This may be from greylisting as noted ablove, or another mechanism. My server includes some automatic blacklisting of poorly configured servers. These kinds of blacklisting are typically temporary, although often for a period of months. The "550 recipient address rejected" typically means the recipient is no longer at the address. (Mailing lists often don't get cleaned, so they can generate a lot of these messages.) As you have setup DMARC, your reporting address should be giving you some indication of why major mailer hosts are rejecting your mail. If you have not setup reporting, do so. Smaller mail servers likely don't support DMARC, so they will not report. You should be able to use your logs to gather enough data to attempt a reasonable replay of rejected messages using telnet. This may provide more details on why the mail was rejected. You can also use this data to contact the postmaster on the receiving server to see if they can provide assistance. 

You can't easily do this, and normally wouldn't need to do that. If you find a local user is spamming you it is usually easy to deal with. Spam filtering is usually done for mail coming from servers you don't have control of. You could try with a base configuration using the remote server as a smart host for all deliveries. It would need to know to route the message back after scanning. You would then need to configure your smarthost routing to skip messages arriving from the system doing spam filtering. 

Try examining the source of similar messages you have recieved. Spammers don't worry about extra keystrokes, but include include non-spam text to try to avoid being seen as spam. I would expect Google and other volume mailers do parse the structure to see how standard it is. Email clients like Outlook, Thuderbird, and others tend to have good standard structure. Spam often is created with tools which produce poor code with non-standard structure. 

The default configuration file should already be configured to retry in 15 minutes. This will solve part of your problems and is generally sufficient to handle rate limiting and other conditions which result in temporary deferral of deliveries. I am not aware of any mechanism which allows you to capture the deferrals and dynamically add the domain to a block list. Check the mechanisms available in the specification for retry rules. Perhaps addingg the domain which is rate limiting you to would help somewhat. You may want to combine that with a domain specific retry rule. You may want to check your configuration to see why you are getting rate limited. DNS errors, or SMTP server configuration errors may contribute to your server being rate limited. 

The input value is octal which may require a leading 0 to be parsed correctly. As the owner mask is almost always 0 the mask can be entered with three digits. As an AND mask, it would need to be entered as 0755 or 0750. Defining it as an AND NOT operation makes it safer if characters are missed in the mask. If umask was and AND operation would allow only limited world access and would be even worse. parsed as a decimal value would be be effectively which would not allow read acces. EDIT: From another perspective, the mask is a list of the bits you want masked off. Therefore you want masks like rather than . Internal representation may well be or what ever is appropriate for ANDing. If not, the conversion is relatively trivial, and in the grand scheme of things the mask doesn't get applied that often. 

vncserver and tightvnc both have Java applets which can be added to your configuration. These are usually servered from a in the 5800 range instead of the 5900 range. For VNV port 1 you would browse to $URL$ This will trigger the applet to download and connect. You will need to setup regular VNC access first. The README file included with the tightvnc-java package includes setup directions. The applet can be served up from an existing web server such as apache. The java code can be run standalone which you may want to use to test your configuration if you are embedding it in a web page. 

You can use sfdisk to backup the partition table, then copy th boot sector (first block). Then restore the partition table with sfdisk. If you are using a DOS MBR, then the mbr program will write the MBR code onto the USB for you. 

If he wants to handle 1000 concurrent users at 500ms, then I would expect a zero error rate. However, it is common that the specification allow for some slow requests. I am used to specification like "95% of the requests will be completed in with 500ms with 1000 concurrent users". Dropping connections is generally not acceptable. 

Placing your DHCP users in the same namespace as your servers is risky. Use a sub-domain for DHCP. Then you can forward the things that need to be sent out to DNS easily. If you are NATing your server addresses make sure to enable hairpin NAT or duplicate the entries with appropriate addresses in your local server. In this case you won't be forwarding the requests.
