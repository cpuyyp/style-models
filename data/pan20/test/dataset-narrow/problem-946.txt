I want to install Windows 7 on a PC that currently has linux installed. My HDD is using the MBR partitioning scheme and its layout is like this: 130MB free space; swap partition(primary); 1.9TB ext4 partition(primary); 100GB free space I know that Windows 7 needs to create both a boot and a root partition for itself. The question is if (and how) I can ask it to use the first 130MB free space as a boot partition and the last 100G as a root partition. If that is not possible, I'd like to know what options I'll have regarding partitioning when installing Windows 7. 

You might want to try instead of 1, but it resulted in re-encode in my test. To get higher video quality, lower the -crf setting, generally 20-28 is the recommended range with lower values producing higher quality. I haven't tried doing two-pass encoding, cbr or abr, but it should work. You can also lower the audio to 192k bitrate. IMPORTANT: Note that you'll need to set to be half of your frame rate. In this example I'm encoding a 30fps video so I've set GOP to 15. If your source is 24fps, set it to 12, if it's 60fps, set it to 30. I know this is an old question, but it's the first result on Google when you search for "ffmpeg options for youtube". Edit: I got these options from $URL$ 

Just to follow-up for anyone else, I ended up having to convert the icon from png to xpm. You definitely used to be able to use png files directly in KDE3, but I guess this must have changed. 

I'd have a poke around in the GUI config app (System Settings > Advanced > Power Management) and check your power options for your current profile. Sounds like 'Dim display when idle for x min' is turned on somewhere. 

There's no way to get Notepad++ to draw a line across the screen to represent page-breaks like Word does, and I'm not aware of a plugin which adds this. You can get it to display non-printing characters by ->->, which will let you see where the breaks are, but this will also display all the other non-printing characters like line feeds. 

This is something which has irritated me for a while: I have a windows machine which has some custom folders in 'My Documents' for various types of files. These show up fine in Explorer, but don't seem to be visible to any of the "File Browse" type dialogs (eg File>Open in any of the Office applications, Add/Remove Programs, etc). Is there a way to force these dialogs to show all folders in the directory? 

I wish to make Vim open every file in read-only mode. My use case is that I use Vim as both my editor and a gdb frontend via the Pyclewn plugin. I typically have one instance of Vim open for editing and another for debugging. I wish that the debugging instance would always open source files in read-only mode so that I do not get the ".swp file already exists" prompt, or that I accidentally edit a file without meaning to. 

These options work for me, as in: the video doesn't undergo further processing/re-encoding by youtube after upload. 

For whatever reason, tmp and var have to be x-initrd.mount, while home and root have to be x-systemd.automount. Hope this helps someone else. 

I have a PC with an SSD and an HDD. I'm running linux. I wish to put all the static (very rarely changing) files on the SSD and the rest on the HDD. To achieve that I'd like to have /boot, /usr, /lib, /bin, /etc, /opt on the SSD and the rest - /var, /tmp, /home on the HDD. However, I do not wish to create a separate partition for each of them, I want each group to be on its own partition. I suppose that I could mount the SDD to /, the HDD to /mnt/hdd and symlink /home, etc. to point to /mnt/hdd/home, etc. Are there problems I can expect with such a setup? Such as a program attempting to read from/write to /var early in the boot process before the HDD is mounted? Will logging work as normal if /var (and /var/log) aren't on the root partition? What would be the best way to solve this? 

I've created a script to update my package manager and post a notification via terminal-notifier. When run manually, it works fine, but when called via launchd (local to the user, in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/), terminal-notifier seemingly doesn't start. It doesn't hang, however; later parts of the script run as expected. Nothing is produced on stdout/stderr. I'm using absolute paths in everything, so that's not the problem either in terms of manual vs. launchd execution. I'm fairly sure this is just another stupid quirk of launchd, but is there any way to overcome it? Launchd agent 

EDIT: I found what's causing the issue, but I don't know how to fix it yet. When the client runs the VPN, all traffic — including that of the SSH tunnel itself — is routed over it. This is circular, of course, and crashes the tunnel. I just need to somehow exclude the SSH tunnel from OpenVPN's routing... 

I've recently set up a Debian Wheezy server with OpenVPN to help out some friends in areas where internet censorship is a problem (including the blocking of VPN traffic in general). To overcome this, clients first create an SSH tunnel to the server, then connect to the VPN over that. The server an open SSH port 40001, and port 40002 for an OpenVPN server with TCP protocol. Both of these seem to be properly configured on the router. I give my clients a script that tunnels their localhost:8080 to myserver:40001, then connects to the VPN. Their client OpenVPN configuration has 'remote' set to 'localhost 8080' such that the VPN connection is directed over this SSH tunnel. My trouble is that this tunnel seems to work sometimes (seemingly at random times) but often fails to hold a connection. I've also seen it simultaneously working on some computers (my own, chiefly) but not others. When it fails, the client will connect to the VPN, but will be unable to access the internet, and after about 30-40 seconds, the SSH tunnel process will simply end (opening the tunnel manually yields only "Write error: Broken pipe" when it dies). I can't find anything whatsoever in either server or client logs to suggest why this is happening or what is killing the tunnel. I know it's not a fault of the VPN connection itself, because if I change the remote IP from localhost:8080 to the real public address and OpenVPN port of my server, it will consistently work properly. My suspicion is that my iptables rules are such that incoming connections directly to the VPN are accommodated, but connections to the VPN coming from inside the server itself (due to the SSH tunnel) are treated differently. However, if this were the case, I don't see why it would work only occasionally. What else could be causing these connection drops? I can't find anything relevant in either /var/log/auth.log, /etc/openvpn/openvpn.log, or any client logs. My /etc/iptables/rules.v4 is as follows: 

You need to click 'Drive Options (Advanced)', which will give the rest of the options including 'New'. Select the unused space, 'New', and the size (it will default to the full amount). 

If you have a small number of known cameras, the best approach for writing a rule is probably to use the serial numbers to distinguish them (as this will work even if they are the same model). I have found this reference really good for getting started with . 

gets its information from and calls to . () gets its information from the kernel via the API. My assumption would have been that this means is likely to be more up-to-date if anything. You shouldn't need to (can't?) manually update Does still show the interfaces? Perhaps they are still present but currently inactive. by default shows only currently-active interfaces. 

Possibly stupid question, but: I'm creating links to some applicatons on my KDE4 desktop. If I change the icon to a built-in system icon, it displays correctly. If I try to change it to an custom icon, the icon stays as the default question-mark. When I navigate to Desktop in a file browser, the thumbnail for the .desktop file is correct, and when I open the file, the property is set correctly, i.e:
