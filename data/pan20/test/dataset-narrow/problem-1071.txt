That's it. The output is shown above. That graphic was captured in Safari, but the result was the same in all the other browsers that I tried: Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, and even Opera and Vivaldi. Note, however, that some of the rounded corners could look quite pixelated in Firefox and Edge, depending on the colors that I used for the bubbles. 

The border replaces any space after setting on the paragraph style, so I clicked Format > Paragraph and set After to 0. Repeat step 3 for the Heading 2 and Heading 3 paragraph styles. 

A standard way to handle repeated text is to use bookmarks in conjunction with fields. Each bit of repeated text is stored in a bookmark, and each repetition of that text is inserted via a field that is linked to the bookmark. So it doesn't matter if two bookmarks happen to store identical looking text at a given time. 

Just modify the paragraph styles that are involved (TOC 1, TOC 2, TOC3, etc.), adjusting the paragraph settings for so that they all have the same left indent (e.g., 0), and left and right tabs at the same locations (with a dot leader applied to the right tab; this should already be set for you, though). When you insert a TOC in one of the predefined TOC styles, you should get the result shown in your screen capture. 

In Word Options > Advance > Show document content, select the check box so that bookmarks are visible. My bet is that after you delete the value from inside the bookmark markers, you then end up typing the new value outside them, so that the only text inside the bookmark is NUMBER or 1 January 20, or nothing. By making bookmarks visible, you can make sure that you enter values inside the bookmark markers. 

If all the larger text in your document will be the same font size, and all the smaller text will be the same, select one bit of smaller text, and then, in the Font dialog box, on the Advanced tab, select Raised in the Position field, and then set the By value to a value that puts the text at the height that you want. Then create a character style for the smaller text. If the correctly styled smaller text is selected when you create the new style, the new style will have the properties of that text by default. (Instead of creating a new style, you could repurpose one of Word's existing styles, updating it to match the style of the smaller text). Then apply the style to all relevant text. Alternatively, depending on the characteristics of the specific font that you're using, and the specific sizes that you're using, just styling the smaller text as a superscript by clicking the Superscript button might get you vertical centered text, or at least close enough to look convincing. 

You'll need to use field codes. For each figure, you can position the cursor at the end of the caption line, and press Ctrl+F9 to insert a field. Between the braces (), type followed by a space. Next press Ctrl+F9 to insert a new field inside the first field. Between the new braces, type . This will grab the figure number that Word autogenerated for the caption. Now, after the closing brace for the field, press Tab (since your screen shot shows that you want the figure number and the caption text to be separated by a tab space), and type the caption text as you want it to appear in the Table of figures. Finally, type . For example, if I want the caption that appears below the figure to say 'The xxx menu,' but the Table of figure to show 'The xxx menu in the yyy program,' I would use this: 

And actually, if you want the chapter number prefixed to the figure number, with a period as the delimiter, as your screen shot shows, you'll need to add another field before the field (Ctrl+F9), and type between the braces. Then, between the closing brace for the field and the opening brace of the field, type a period. For example: 

Another possible approach is to modify the heading style so that it's inserted in a frame. If Frame appears in the Format drop-down at the bottom of the Modify style dialog box, you can specify that the content of the heading should be in a frame, and that the surrounding content should flow around it. See, for example, this Super User question; although this involves side headings in the left margin and is for a later version of Word, the basic principles are the same. (When I suggested using style separators in my comment, I didn't think this functionality for applying frames to paragraph styles existed in Word 2007, but this page and others indicate that it did.) Unlike headings in a table, headings in a frame will show up in both the TOC and the document map (Navigation pane in later versions of Word). 

To create the first of your three examples, just select each column separately and apply numbering to it. To create the second and third examples, you start by doing the same as #1. Then do one of the following: 

At this point, you can just press Delete (Backspace in Windows) to delete it. If the anchor doesn't appear when you select the paragraph (and doesn't disappear when you cut/delete that paragraph), it may be anchored in the page's header or footer. In this case, open the header, and press Command ⌘+A (Ctrl+A in Windows) to select all. If the object is anchored there, the anchor icon will appear, and you can delete the object. If the anchor doesn't appear, repeat this step in the footer. 

You can insert a text box, format and position it exactly as you want it to appear, and even add default text to it. Then select the text box, and save it to the Text Box Gallery (on the Insert tab, in the Text group, click Text Box > Save Selection to Text Box Gallery). You can then quickly insert a copy on every page by selecting in on the Text Box drop-down. (Tip: When you're saving the text box to the gallery, in the Category field, click Create New Category, and enter a name that starts with a special character, such as * or _; that way, your text box will always be the topmost option in the Text Box drop-down.) If you want a script that that will add a text box to every page for you, you may be able to adapt the answer on this Office forum page. 

As I mentioned in a comment, HTML/CSS is a better and much easier way to do this than Word. You can get just the result you want (including slightly rounded top-right and/or bottom-right corners where one bubble meets another of the same color) through some very basic HTML and just a couple of CSS rules, as opposed to inserting a bunch of Word shapes. Mostly to satisfy my own curiosity, I came up with the following example. 

Instead of setting the line spacing to a multiple value (1.5), open the Paragraph dialog box, and set the Line spacing field to Exactly and the At field to a value that is 1.5 times the font size that you're using (15 pt if your font size is 10 pt, 18 pt if it's 12 pt, and so on). 

(Note: For each field that you need, press Ctrl+F9, and then type the field information between the braces () that are generated. Alternatively, on the Insert tab, in the Text group, click Quick Parts > Field, select Ref, and then select the name of the bookmark in the list.) Finally, select all, and press F9 to update fields. A series of dialog boxes will open, each prompting for a different piece of information. After you click OK in the last, bookmarks are created to store the info that you entered, and then all the fields are filled with the appropriate info. To generate another doc that has different information, select all and update fields again. Alternatively, after you've inserted the various fields, save the document as a Word template. 

The hyperlink method is the only one I've ever been able to come up with for doing this in Word itself. If you have access to the full version of Adobe Acrobat, I found this article that describes 2 methods for adding screen tips in a PDF. The first method looks pretty nice. I note, though, that the examples included in the author's sample file don't work on my Mac. One last option that occurs to me is to convert the doc to a webpage (e.g., save the Word file as a Web Page if there aren't images or as a Single File Web Page if there are) and distribute it that way. You could then edit the HTML code, adding a attribute to the relevant text to specify the tooltip text. 

To access the Master Document functionality, on the View tab, in the Views group, click Outline. You're taken to a new tab that's named Outlining. In the Master Document group, click Show Document. You can then click Insert to insert subdocuments into the current document, which then becomes the master document. You can also use Object > Insert as Text in the Text group on the Insert tab. The trick is that, after you select a file to insert, you have to click the arrow on the right side of the Insert button and then click Insert as Link. Otherwise, as you noted, the subdocument is inserted as static text. 

Place the cursor at the beginning or end of the '1. Mammals' paragraph, or even select the whole paragraph, and then press Alt+Shift+O (that's the letter O, not a zero). In the Entry field, enter the text that should appear in the TOC (if you selected the whole paragraph in step 1, the paragraph text will be automatically entered for you). Set Level to 2, because you want the '1. Mammals' heading to be a 2nd-level entry. Click Mark. Repeat steps 1–4 for everything that you want to be a level-2, level-3, level-4, or level-5 heading, setting the Level field as appropriate. 

(Because the space+dash after the part number was part of the autonumbering definition, I didn't need to manually type it between the two fields.) 

Margin widths don't scale, but if you align things like text boxes and images relative to, e.g., the margins instead of at absolute positions on the page, and if you specify the width of tables, and the width and/or height of text boxes and background images as percentages of the margin, page, or column width/height, the template will adapt somewhat gracefully to changes in paper size. I've used this approach to design a single template that was used by project members in both the US and Europe, so documents needed to look good regardless of whether they were written in/printed on Letter or A4 paper sizes. 

On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, set the Display for Review field to No Markup, or, in the Show Markup field, clear the selection for Insertions and Deletions. Either way, you'll no longer see which text has been inserted and deleted, but you'll be able to use the Synonyms command. 

Do this for every captioned figure in your document. (You can copy and paste the entire field, including the braces, and then change just the text that should appear in the Table of figures. All the numbering will be corrected when you update field codes later.) Then, position the cursor in the location where you want the Table of figures to appear, and press Ctrl+F9 to insert a field. Between the braces, type . Press Ctrl+A to select the whole document, and then press F9 to update all field codes. Here's the Table of figures that I ended up with after adding a caption and field to another figure in my document. 

If you want to include the bookmarked text as static (non-updatable) text in main.docx, use the first method under step 2, but instead of clicking the arrow next to Insert and then clicking Insert as Link, just click Insert. 

The difficulty here is that you want the chapter headings in the chapters themselves to consist of "Chapter x" followed by a line/paragraph break and then the chapter title; but the TOC has to have just the chapter number followed by a tab space and then the chapter title. But at the same time, the chapter titles have to have autonumbering applied (via the multilevel list), so that the chapter numbers are included in the numbering for subheadings. It can all be done, but it takes some work. Unfortunately, I could manage to get all the indents and alignment in the TOC to work only by inserting two separate TOCs (one for the "List of Figures" and "List of Tables" headings, and one for everything else). Here's what I did: Set up a multilevel list. (It sounds as though you've already done this.) Level 1 of the list is assigned to Heading 1 style, uses an arabic numeral that's preceded by the word "Chapter" and a space. Set Follow number with to Nothing. Level 2 is assigned to Heading 2 style, and uses an arabic numeral preceded by the number from Level 1 and then a period. And Level 3 is assigned to Heading 3 style, and also uses an arabic numeral, preceded by the number from Level 1, a period, the number from Level 2, and a period. Insert the cursor between the autogenerated "Chapter"+chapter number, and insert a line break (Shift+Enter). For each chapter, follow these steps:
