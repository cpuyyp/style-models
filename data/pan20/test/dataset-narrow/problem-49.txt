I'm not sure I understand your question. If you are asking about the command, then only tagged frames are used on a trunk. Untagged frames received on the trunk will be dropped, and all frames sent on the trunk will be tagged (this does not include link-local protocols, e.g. STP, CDP, DTP, etc.). 

I'm not sure I completely understand. If you want both outside interfaces to be able to translate, then you need to set up NAT to do that. You will need two NAT statements: 

If you simply want to prevent load balancing, then you can use the command in EIGRP to do that. Just set it to : 

Note: Bandwidth is how any raw bits you can push across a link in a given time period, usually measured in bps (bits per second). Throughput is how much usable data you can push across a link (basically, the bandwidth minus the protocol overhead), usually measured in Bps (bytes per second). 

MAC address spoofing is more about network disruption than about stealing information. A switch can only have a single MAC address table entry for each MAC address. The attacker will not get every frame destined for its attack target. As frames come into the switch from both the attacker and the target, the MAC address table will flap. Some frames will go to the attacker, and some will go to the original target. Some switches will recognize the flapping, and you can mitigate it. 

The ISO definition of the OSI model is the definition of the OSI model. Anybody else who writes anything that disagrees with the ISO definition is making up something that is not the OSI model. Just because it is published in a web page does not make it true. It is true only if it agrees with the ISO definition of the OSI model. 

Unfortunately, that router and the interface cards for it have reached not only End-of-Sale, but also End-of-Life. You may be able to find a used HWIC-1GE-SFP card. 

The reason is to prevent routing loops; iBGP cannot learn iBGP learned prefixes from another iBGP speaker because its own AS will be in the AS_PATH. If that case is allowed, iBGP Router A could learn prefixes from iBGP Router B and advertise them to iBGP Router C. After that, iBGP Router C could advertise the prefixes back to iBGP routers that have already learned the prefixes, either directly or through other iBGP routers. The rule exists so that other iBGP speakers cannot learn the prefixes from any source other than Router B, thus preventing router loops, but that requires that the iBGP speakers are connected (at least logically) in a full mesh. There are a couple of mitigations for the full mesh requirement: you can use Route Reflectors or Confederations. 

According to the IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry, the Documentation address range cannot be used in source or destination addressing, is not forwardable (routable) nor globally reachable, and is not reserved by any protocol. That makes the address range unsuitable for use on an actual network. How, for example, would you use any addresses in that range if they are not allowed to be used as source or destination addresses in IP packets? In fact, you may run across some devices that simply refuse to use that address range, and that would be perfectly within standards. After all, IANA does own all the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. 

Based on your question about the routing protocol, I will assume you are not running one, but you are using static routes, probably static default routes. You could use a routing protocol, but you would need to make the connected default route on Link 2 have a worse AD than the default route received from the routing protocol. A routing protocol will also take some time to fail a neighbor, so it wouldn't be instantaneously. It may be possible, depending on your router/IOS combination, to add tracking to a static route. See: Reliable Static Routing Backup Using Object Tracking Some router/IOS combinations can use BFD to detect a down neighbor when the link stays up. 

If the hosts on the unmanaged switch have a gateway set to , then traffic from those hosts to a different network will be sent to that router, and if that router needs to send back to the switch on that network, it will not. Routers have split-horizon, meaning that they will not route back to the same network on which a packet is received. You want the inter-VLAN routing to happen on the switch, not the WAN router, so the switch must be the gateway for all the hosts. The WAN router should inject the default route into OSPF, and you should not have a default route on the switch. 

You can use VRRP, assuming your routers support it, but it requires at least two or three IP addresses in the same network. You need an address for each of the routers, and one address for the virtual address (some implementations of VRRP allow the virtual address to be the real address of one of the routers). The routers also need to be able to communicate with each other on the LAN where VRRP is used. You do this by connecting the router interfaces to the same layer-2 LAN. Doing this on the WAN side of your routers will give the Data Center redundant access to your routers, but you will still have a Single-Point-of-Failure from your routers to the Data Center. The network for your link to the Data Center must be, at most, , since any longer mask will not provide more than two usable addresses, and the link will require, at least, three addresses. Doing this on the LAN side of your routers provides the hosts on the LAN with router redundancy. To protect the switch, you could place a transparent firewall between the Data Center and the switch, or you could use an unmanaged switch. You may want the firewall if your routers need protection, too. If your Data Center link only has two addresses, the firewall could terminate the link, and then it can provide a different network for your routers. Placing a router between your equipment and the Data Center creates another SPoF. Routers route between networks, so having multiple networks attached to a router is normal. 

The general rule is that you apply standard ACLs as close to the destination as possible in order to prevent dropping too much traffic, and extended ACLs should be placed as close to the source as possible in order to prevent wasting router resources routing traffic that is destined to be dropped anyway. 

I think you are confused. Did you carefully read what you quoted? The side that terminates can keep receiving data, but it cannot send anything back into the connection. That means that if the server terminates the connection, but the client does not, the client can send data to the server, but the server cannot send anything to the client. If the server needs to send anything back to the client to fulfill the request, it cannot. There are reasons for the handshaking, and your desire to speed things up by eliminating the handshaking means that you are using the wrong transport protocol for what you want to do. It sounds like you want to use UDP instead of TCP. Any TCP features you wish to keep will need to be handled by the applications, but UDP eliminates all the handshaking. Alternatively, you could create your own transport protocol. 

When a layer-2 frame reaches a layer-3 device, like a router, the layer-2 frame is stripped off so that the router can read the layer-3 information. When the router switches the packet to a new interface, it creates a new frame for the new link. The information in the old frame headers (MAC addresses, etc.) were lost when the frame was stripped off, so the router creates a new frame with its own MAC address as the source address, and the other end of the link's MAC address as the destination address. This all assumes that the intermediate links are something like ethernet, with MAC addresses. Other layer-2 protocols may be in a link, and not all layer-2 protocols use MAC addresses. 

This actually happens in the real world, too. On ethernet, and other protocols that use MAC addresses, it is due to ARP. You will drop one or two initial pings. It can happen, too, with frame relay, depending on how you have it configured. 

It sounds like you simply need to configure the switch as a DHCP relay. You can then manage DHCP for all the networks on the central DHCP server, and configure the gateway for each DHCP scope separately. The gateway for each network will be the address of the router for that network, probably the address you have defined for the VLAN in the layer-3 switch. You do not set a default route for the individual networks, you set it for the router (layer-3 switch, in this case). This is the route that the router uses for any destination networks for which is has no other path. It will inherently have paths to any directly connected network, and it can get paths for other networks by using statically defined routes or routing protocols. The default route is simply a statically defined route that is used as a last resort because any other router in the routing table will have a longer match. You probably want a routed link () for the network from the layer-3 switch to the firewall. You will need to somehow let the firewall know about the networks on the other side of the layer-3 switch, either by statically defined routes, or with a routing protocol. Alternatively, you will need to create individual (virtual) network interfaces on the firewall, which will need to support 802.1Q VLANs. 

On a LAN, a router is simply another host. It passes packets to other hosts in the same LAN the same way that hosts on a LAN pass packets to other hosts on the same LAN. Routers on a LAN that uses MAC addresses (not all layer-2 protocols use MAC addresses) will use ARP in the same way that hosts on a LAN use ARP to resolve the layer-3 address to a layer-2 (LAN) address. Unfortunately, the cheapest SOHO devices are explicitly off-topic here. A manufacturer of a hardware device must offer optional, paid support for a device to be on-topic here. See What topics can I ask about here?, especially the caveat under "and meets the following requirements:" hardware that has a paid support option (enterprise/provider class products, some small business class devices). Questions about consumer-grade devices can be asked on Super User. 

Yes, that appears to be correct. If the link from R1 to R6 goes down, then you will still have a route, but the cost will be more. 

There is no real difference in IPv4 or IPv6 network diagrams. The network devices are the same things (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), and the diagrams look the same, other than the addressing. Routers route between networks, and IPv6 still uses networks. Firewalls are still used to protect networks. Switches are still used to connect hosts. Since IPv6 has plenty of address space, there is no need to NAT. NAT breaks the original IP premise of end-to-end connectivity, where every device has a unique IP address. IPv6 doesn't have a NAT standard, and NAT breaks things in IPv6. NAT was developed as a short-term solution to the IPv4 address shortage, and it is expected to go away once IPv6 is ubiquitous. 

A tunnel itself is just wrapping packets inside an outer packet as the payload of the outer packet. If the link which the tunnel packets cross is losing traffic, having a tunnel is no better than not having a tunnel. The problem could be exacerbated because packets may need to be fragmented because of the smaller MTU on the tunnel, and loss of any packet fragment is loss of the entire packet. 

The IEEE maintains all the ethernet standards in 802.3. If you are programming hardware to communicate via ethernet, you need to follow those. IP is not directly related to ethernet since it is at a higher layer and can use protocols other than ethernet on various layer-1 media. Conversely, ethernet can transport higher layer protocols other than IP. 

Each switch port will operate at the speed of the established link on that port. The ports are independent of each other when it comes to negotiating the speed. Ports where devices have connected at 1 Gbps will operate at 1 Gbps, but ports where devices have connected at 100 Mbps will only operate at 100 Mbps. Where you introduce a bottleneck (e.g. traffic coming in a port at 1 Gbps, or multiple 100 Mbps ports, destined to single port which only has a 100 Mbps connection), you will probably drop a lot of frames. This can't be helped, and it is the way switches work. 

DHCP is independent from NAT. Neither are a routing function; it's just that these are services that are often convenient to run on a router. If you don't want DHCP to assign the addresses, then you must exclude them in DHCP. You should have a range set aside for statically assigned addresses, and you can exclude the range. For example, in the network, you could have to set aside for statically assigned devices like server and printers. You would then use: 

You cannot capture any traffic that does not reach the machine that you are using to capture. If the interesting traffic is between two machines, and it never reaches your capture machine, then you can't capture it. Depending on the network topology, you may be able to mitigate the problem. For example, setting up SPAN on an ethernet LAN. 

Doing it that way will put the networks from every interface into OSPF, and it will try to connect neighbors on all the interfaces. This will save you from needing to add network statement every time you bring up a new interface. If you have any interfaces on which you don't want to try to form neighbors, you can use the command to still use the interface's network, but not send hellos on the interface. You probably want to do this with the WAN interface since you don't want the ISP to neighbor with your network. 

This allows the ISP HSRP to work since the ISP routers need to be able to talk to each other on the same VLAN so that the ISP HSRP works. Alternate (stacked) Configuration: SW1/2 stack: 

Correction: You question claims, a few times, that the root bridge is selected by bridge ID and MAC address. It is selected only by the bridge ID, of which the MAC address is part. The bridge ID is the bridge priority plus the MAC address, and the MAC address is not considered separately when selecting the root bridge. The most significant part of the bridge ID is the priority, and you need to configure the priority if you want to determine (and you should want to determine) which bridge becomes the root bridge. The MAC address is only significant if there are identical priorities. 

Notice that you do not need an access list to match the precedence in , and since you are nesting the precedence match with a in and , you do not need to include the precedence in the access lists for the other class maps. This will force and to match both the access lists defining the address range, and the IP precedence, much like you have in the original access lists, but using to match the precedence instead of including it in the access lists. 

This is something you really want to hire a cable vendor to do. Outside Plant (OSP) cabling is a specialty, and there are things you must do for life/safety (legal requirements), and things you must do to make sure the cable will not fail. For instance, outside cable is not allowed to extend more than 50' inside a building, you must bury it at least 24", or below the frost line, whichever is greater. Direct buried cable needs to be armored, loose-tube, and probably gel-filled. There is also grounding, bonding, and lightning protection that must be carefully done because the armor will be metallic. This is not something for amateurs, and the cable vendor will run bulk cable and terminate it to a cable patch panel with the appropriate type of connector.
