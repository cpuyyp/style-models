If you're not familiar, Ventrilo is a voice chatroom used for gaming. Here's the wiki for Ventrilo and similar software Mumble and TeamSpeak to give you an idea of what the software is about. I tried to find out if a locally hosted (i.e. my own) Ventrilo server uses encryption of sufficient strength to prevent eavesdropping and was unable to do so. I found an article on wireshark.org talking about a pre-shared key, but it does not go in depth about how or why the key is used. This comparison mentions some things related to encryption, privacy, and security, but does not answer my question. Does Ventrilo use sufficient encryption to prevent eavesdropping while the connection is going through the internet? Using Server 3.0.3 and client 3.0.8, which are the ones posted on the download page. Edit By saying "prevent eavesdropping" I mean that they use modern or known to be strong encryption, not something that has been well known to be hacked since the software was produced. For example, DES to encrypt the packets in transit would be encryption, but would not be sufficient to prevent eavesdropping since it is easy to crack or has been considered to be cracked for a long time. Another example in that same vein: using WEP to secure your WAP/Wireless network. Technically, it's using some kind of encryption, but it is easy to bypass and no one considers this a strong level of encryption. VPN protocols and encryption have a similar example. PPTP does not have strong encryption, and while it is/was an option for mobile VPNs, it was usually a legacy one, there if that was all your device supported. The ability to crack PPTP exists, but it takes days to crack it; that's only going to get quicker. On the flipside to PPTP, OpenVPN is considered to have strong encryption, so if you use a VPN provider that gives you the choice of protocols, you should choose OpenVPN. You can ascertain the encryption strength of something independent of a particular threat model. You don't have to ask a question "Is this encrypted good enough to defeat X", mostly because attackers, bad guys, and hackers are not arranged in a linear fashion, nor assigned a "hacker power level" of any kind. "Can this encryption be defeated by guys with hacker power level 9000? Or do they have to be over 9000 to break it?" is not a valid question, nor comparison. People attacking your comms are bubbles in a 3D Venn diagram, not lines on a number line. Meaning they have overlap in capabilities, even if there is a large amount of overlap (ie in the case of state sponsored attackers). 

Some webmasters make their websites have white text on black background. I find this hard to read for longer than a short period of time. I get various visual anomalies and my eyes get watery. Ars Technica has a cookie based preference to allow you to switch themes from white on black (default) to black text on white background. This is great. Not all websites do this. How can I manage a website/webapp that does not explicitly have this same function baked in? Usually I am reading news, articles, how-to's, and that sort of thing, so they are lengthy, detailed, and require time to read. I imagine that I could modify the HTML or the CSS, potentially with GreaseMonkey. I found a Firefox extension a while ago called Blank Your Monitor that will change the text and background. However, it changes all of the open tabs to those new colors. Not just the current or selected tab(s). Instead of looking for a technological work around, should I contact the webmaster? As I delve into EE, Linux, FOSS, and modern maker based sites, I encounter this phenomenon more often. Apparently the taste for white on black is strong with this crowd. 

I do tech support and the argument of TIA-568A vs TIA-568B vs 'whatever, but straight through" comes up every now and again. You should use the appropriate standard for your application. Since you're referring to Ethernet, you should use Cat5e or Cat6 cable and terminate with the TIA-568B pinout. TIA-568A This standard is acceptable/meant for voice communications. By voice, I mean telephony. You would probably see this on a CAT3 cable, and telecom engineers and electricians are probably familiar with it. Any analog voice systems would probably be using this standard, even if they were using a higher CAT cable like CAT5. This pinout should not be used for data networks, though it will function to some degree; you may see errors, reduced data rate, or other less-than-desirable results. TIA-568B This standard should be used for data networks, packetized video, or other intensive applications (throughput or bandwidth). I don't think there is a negative consequence to using this standard for voice, but it goes against convention, so I would not use this standard for voice communications. Random straight through Sometimes, someone will tell you that as long as the ends match, you don't even need a standard. That may suffice for electrical conductivity, for example if you are using some CAT cable to control a relay, but for communications (tele- or data-), you should use the appropriate, relevant, standard. Misc notes 

I am not a fan of the backstage. Until today, I didn't even know it had a name (besides "yet another annoying new Microsoft feature"). I would like to disable it in its entirety. I've come across a few articles that mention disabling it for the Save and Open dialogs, and that works as intended (AskVG). However, I almost always "Save As" instead of "Save" for a variety of reasons. There doesn't appear to be a way to remove the backstage for "Save As". I'd prefer to disable the backstage entirely. If I can't do that, I would like to disable it for the "Save As" function. Is there a way to do either? Backstory The backstage gets in the way of seeing the document (usually a PowerPoint) when I am using the "Save As" dialog box. I paste a lot of screenshots into various PowerPoints, and I like to name things descriptively. However, I can't be descriptive when looking at the backstage. I would like to look at the actual document when saving the file. Frequently I find myself saving several different open PowerPoint files and can easily lose track of what their contents are, especially if it's been hours since I made the screenshots. The backstage adds in several extra steps of trying to save, failing at saving (because I forgot what I was working on), going back to the doc, figuring out a name, then saving again. I got in a habit of always Saving As because that's how you can version a file. Also, I'm sure there was a significant element of Microsoft getting in the way, or burning me for just saving and not saving as, though I can't recall at the moment. 

Windows 10 Home OpenVPN client openvpn-install-2.4.4-I601.exe Previous client: openvpn-install-2.4.3-I601.exe If the physical network adapter loses link (unplugged, Wi-Fi goes away, etc), OpenVPN will not notice and display that it's still connected. However, access through the tunnel fails. I can open the client and issue a reconnect, and then it negotiates a new session(?) and works fine. This behavior started in 2.4.3. Prior to that version, I never had need to manually reconnect, the software was smart enough to figure out that it should reconnect on disconnect. My config file did not change when I upgraded to 2.4.3 I've seen some questions and forum posts over the years mentioning a keep alive and disabling the option, but I'm not convinced either are the proper solution or a workaround, mostly because not enough people claimed it would work. The release notes for 2.4 mention , which I'm guessing caused my problem, since I noticed this issue when upgrading to 2.4 What can i do to get the OpenVPN client to reconnect on disconnect? Config file 

I am running Windows N, and it seems that YouTube Live and the -N flavor don't play well together (reddit, reddit, reddit (Doesn't apply to my PaleMoon) ). Regular YouTube videos play fine, I only have a problem with livestreams. It seems that Firefox (or Palemoon) requires Microsoft software to play HTML5 H.264 live streams. The whole reason I chose Windows N was so I didn't have to have Windows Media player et al. It seems that with Windows N, it's a de facto requirement to install the media pack (Windows 7, Windows 10), which just installs all the software that was regulated by the EU to not be bundled with the OS, thereby defeating the point of Windows N. How can I get YouTube Live working in Windows N without installing the media pack (thus defeating the point of Windows N)? 

In searching Superuser, I found a Q&A mentioning codecs. Installing the K-Lite Codec pack had no effect, except to change my search settings and homepage to Bing(R) (d'oh!). This is the symptom: 

If you want your WAP/router to do this, OpenWRT can probably help you do it, though you will need some Linux skills: 

I'm building a script to take a IP addresses from a CSV and then attempt to ping/connect to them. Eventually I will run some commands against them and output all of it as extra data in the CSV. Right now I'm working with 2 different CSVs (input and output) until I figure out the append process. 

I have noticed that DownThemAll is having some sort of problem. It's missing the usual window bar at the top with the window controls and, in my case, blue bar. See pic below. I can right click on the left side and get window controls, as well as drag it around, so I'm not sure if this is a bug or feature. I tried tracking down the forums for this extension, but it appears that the domain expired a few days ago. I've tried resetting the extension to defaults, and no change. There aren't any options related to this as far as I can tell anyways. I will try restarting Firefox and rebooting next. I'm in the middle of something else I'd have done it already. Is this a bug or a feature? How do I get the top bar back? Downthemall 3.0.8, Firefox 55.03, Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 bit 

Where can I find documentation on this command, and others, included with the PSCX installer? Adding insult to injury, it seems that the author doesn't' want you usinf Ping-Host. I get the following error for the command 

I have changed computers a few times recently, and setting up Firefox the way I like is pretty tedious, and comes after setting up Windows the way I like. Obviously, I have a lot of tweaks, customizations, and add-ons I want to bundle together. I could use a portable app on a drive and take it everywhere, but on one of the new PCs, it's corporate and I don't want to stick my dongle in there and risk losing something from some random overhystemic malware scan. I did some research and it seems Internet chatter on the topic has died off in recent years, and I'm not sure if that's because something won, or because Firefox is losing market share. I would like for a single installer, maybe a secondary installer, to set things up the way I like. I'd prefer something like The Tor Browser Bundle does, where it has extensions preloaded with certain settings preconfigured. Maybe later I'd like to repackage TBB itself, but for now I'd settle on vanilla Firefox. I primarily use Windows, mostly 7, some 2012 R2, and now 10. Other platforms would be icing on the cake. I'm looking for some advice on which is the modern way to do this, and preferably a single tool that will output a new installer. However, Mike Kaply's method where you install Firefox, and then load the config will probably work, if I can get it to remember where extension icons are placed in the UI. I'm not sure it can do that yet, but it seems like it can do everything else. I've stumbled across: 

Starting in Office 2013, Microsoft implemented a new GUI architecture, and Office doesn't respect the theme or personalization settings of the OS. I don't like it, and it causes problems for me quite frequently (the code, not the visuals). It caused problems when I used 2013, and over the years, I've started to figure out parts of the problems. One of the problems is the transparent border around the window. How do I turn this off? I usually run windows using the "classic theme", which disables almost all transparency effects. I use Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 10 Enterprise. The transparent border is outside of the regular window, so if I want to resize the window, I don't click on the border, like I do with every other window, I have to click outside the window. This is a problem in and of itself, because when I try to adjust the window size, I frequently wind up clicking on the window behind the window I am trying to adjust. This forum post is related to the phenomenon, and probably two VDI technologies fighting each other. However, I already disable hardware acceleration when I install Office. 

USB Hubs don't get the reviews that most other PC parts do. What should I look for in a 2.0, 3.x, or -C hub to make sure it won't cause problems, won't be a bottleneck, and give me hassle free, awesome performance? I'm not referring to obvious features like if the cable can be removed, an included power supply, number of ports, or things like that. This answer refers to TTs, of which I was unfamiliar with until I read it. I know that if I get a $3 or $4 USB 2.0 hub, I won't expect much for performance. But I have no way to gauge the quality or performance of a more expensive hub. 

I have a similar but much more varied use case , so I had to find a solution to navigating around lots of different folder structures. I wound up finding the program Direct Folders. This lets me set up links to certain directories and I can middle click and select them instantly when I save a file, rather than navigate a complex folder structure. Also, when Firefox randomly decides to go to a different folder, you can get a wrangle on it. This might be overkill for your particular use case, but my use case is similar. If the other solutions don't work for you, this one will. I'm not affiliated with Code Sector, but I do like several of their softwares. 

I had been searching for a super fast way ping many IPs and stumbled across this question (among others). Eventually, I found a script that was easy to integrate into what I wanted to do. The guy calls it Fast Ping Sweep Asynchronous. Even being a Power Shell n00b, I was able to pipe its output, and then modify its output to only include what I wanted. I came across other scripts, but could not decipher their scripts to modify them for my purposes. I'm not sure what version Power Shell this requires, but it works on v4 and v5. 

I'm relatively new to Windows 10. It's only redeeming feature seems to be the awesome support for touch displays. I've noticed on an Acer Switch Alpha 12 and an HP Laptop that the keyboard and mouse seem to freeze or crash randomly or intermittently. At first I thought it was just the Microsoft Arc mouse with the Switch Alpha 12, but then I noticed that the keyboard backlight would randomly turn on the same time the mouse started working again. The HP laptop seems to have a similar issue with its trackpad, though it seems to be related to multiple fingers on the trackpad (1 to move the cursor, 1 to click). I think it's odd to have different but similar symptoms on unrelated hardware, so that leads me to the OS. I've done as much as I can to disable to privacy invasions of Windows 10, one of which is a keylogger sending all key presses to Microsoft HQ. I've been using Spybot Anti-Beacon for this. I've searched SuperUser and the Internets at large didn't find anything relevant. i guess the search terms were too vague. What can i do to fix this issue? Where can I dig into it to find out what is going on?
