If the demands satisfy the no-bottleneck assumption, that is $\max_i d_i \leq \min_e c(e)$ then a constant factor approximation is known even for trees. See $URL$ which gives a 48-approx for trees. For paths a better bound can be obtained and may have been shown but I am not sure where or whether it was published. For the general case it is not quite clear what the best known result is. One can get an easy $O(\log n)$-approximation as follows. Consider the problem of maximizing the number of requests that can be feasibly routed; there is a constant factor approximation for this problem, see $URL$ Using this as a black box one can do a greedy set-cover like algorithm to repeatedly pack as many requests as possible to get the desired $O(\log n)$-approximation. A paper by Chalermsook on coloring rectangles may have some implications including giving an $O(\log \log n)$-approximation; the paper is available at $URL$ However it may require figuring out several technical details. One suspects that there is a constant factor approximation for the coloring problem. 

Whether a real (multivariate) polynomial $p$ can be expressed as a sum of squares of real polynomials can be solved by reduction to semi-definite programming. Need to know SDP and that SDP can be solved efficiently. 

See the following paper by Khanna etal on syntactic vs computational views of approximability. MaxSNP is a syntactic class while APX is a computational class. dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=298507 Made comment into answer as per Suresh's request. 

You may want to look at nowhere dense graphs. $URL$ One of the reasons why minor-closedness is natural is the following. We typically want to work with families of graphs rather than specific graphs. And we want to solve problems with arbitrary weights/capacities on edges/nodes. Suppose we want to solve the shortest path problem in a family of graphs. Then, if we allow for zero length and infinite lengths then basically we are allowing minor operations on the family. In some settings it makes sense to work with unweighted graphs where positive results can be obtained for larger families of graphs that are not necessarily minor-closed. 

There is a nice book by Gartner and Matousek on SDPs and their applications to approximation algorithms. It covers a lot with the added benefit of giving a good introduction to the theory of semi-definite programming. See $URL$ 

Yes, this variant, and in fact a further generalization has been considered in the literature. See the paper below for the problem they call capacitated facility location. J. Bar-Ilan, G. Kortsarz and D. Peleg, Generalized submodular cover problems and applications, Theoretical Computer Science, 250:179-200, 2001.

On the other hand, Chen, Waingarten, and Xie [4] showed that non-adaptive testing of unateness had query complexity $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$, hence the separation. 

Edit: As pointed out in the comments by Denis Pankratov, the first variant admits a trivial $O(\log n)$ upper bound (sending $\lvert x\rvert$ to Bob is enough). 

Let $f\colon 2^{[n]} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a submodular function (one can assume $f$ is bounded, if this helps). We are given noisy oracle access to $f$: on any $S$ and for any $\tau > 0$, one can obtain an additive $\tau$-approximation of $f(S)$ (at cost $\operatorname{poly}(1/\tau)$). I am interested in what is known in minimizing (up to some arbitrary (additive) accuracy $\alpha>0$) $f$, given this sort of access: If we had exact oracle access, then this could be done in polynomial time, exactly; what about robustness to approximate queries? Is there any algorithm (or, on the other side of the spectrum, lower bounds) for it? 

Yuval Peres gave the answer in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Another way is to recall that the sample complexity will be captured by the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance between the two coins. Now, letting $D_p$ and $D_{p+\varepsilon}$ be the distributions of a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$ and $p+\varepsilon$ respectively, $$\begin{align} d_H(D_p,D_{p+\varepsilon})^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\lVert D_p-D_{p+\varepsilon}\rVert^2_2 = \frac{1}{{2}}\left((\sqrt{p}-\sqrt{p+\varepsilon})^2+(\sqrt{1-p}-\sqrt{1-p-\varepsilon})^2\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{2}\left({p(1-\sqrt{1+\varepsilon/p})^2+(1-p)(\sqrt{1}-\sqrt{1-\varepsilon/(1-p)})^2}\right) \end{align}$$ Assuming wlog $p\leq 1/2$, we can see easily by a Taylor expansion that this is $$\begin{align} d_H(D_p,D_{p+\varepsilon})^2 &= \Theta\left(\frac{\varepsilon^2}{p}\right) \end{align}$$ leading to the same answer as Yuval Peres' (from a different method). Interestingly, this also shows the usual observation, that the quadratic relation between TV and Hellinger distance can matter a lot: for $p=1/2$, the bound $1/TV$ (i.e., $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^2)$ here) is tight; but for $p=O(\varepsilon)$, then it is quadratically worse than the optimal, which is $1/d_H^2$ (that is, $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$). 

As mentioned in a comment above, the Boolean Hidden Matching Problem introduced and studied in [BJK04,KR06] seems to (almost) meet your requirement. The input size is roughly $n\log n$ (as an input is of the form $(x,M,w)\in\{0,1\}^{2n}\times\{0,1\}^{n\times 2n}\times \{0,1\}^{2n}$, where $M$ is a very sparse matrix that can be encoded with $n\log n$ bits); and $\textsf{yes}$- and $\textsf{no}$-instances of the promise problem have distance $\Theta(n)$, The one-way randomized communication complexity of $\textsf{BHM}_n$ is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, as shown in [KR06]. 

Here is a formal reason why the problem is not poly-time solvable unless P=NP. We know that finding the treewidth of a given graph is NP-Hard. Given a graph $G$ we can add a disjoint clique of size $V(G)+1$ to create a new graph $G'$. A min-width tree-decomposition of $G'$ can be obtained as follows: it has two nodes with one bag containing all the nodes of the clique and the other containing all the nodes of $G$. Now making this tree-decomposition lean would require finding a lean-tree decomposition of the original graph $G$ which would, as a by-product, give the treewidth of $G$. 

I strongly disagree with the last paragraph. Blanket statements like that are not useful. If you look at papers in many systems areas such as networking, databases, AI and so on you will see that plenty of approximation algorithms are used in practice. There are some problems for which one desires very accurate answers; for example say an airline interesting in optimizing its fleet scheduling. In such cases people use various heuristics that take substantial computational time but get better results than a generic approximation algorithm can give. Now for some theoretical reasons for studying approximation algorithms. First, what explains the fact that knapsack is very easy in practice while graph coloring is quite hard? Both are NP-Hard and poly-time reducible to each other. Second, by studying approximation algorithms for special cases of a problem one can pin-point what classes of instances are likely to be easy or hard. For example we know that many problems admit a PTAS in planar and minor-free graphs while they are much harder in arbitrary general graphs. The idea of approximation pervades modern algorithm design. For example, people use data streaming algorithms and without the approximation lens is hard to understand/design algorithms because even simple problems cannot be solved exactly. 

Kolloiopoulos and Young give an $O(\log m)$ approximation for general covering integer programs. See the paper below. $URL$ 

The relaxation of Calinescu, Karloff and Rabani for the undirected Multiway Cut problem is one my favorites. Had a big influence on subsequent work. $URL$

(Sorry, this is a bit biased towards papers I have co-authored, mostly due to my familiarity with those.) 

For randomized algorithms $\mathcal{A}$ taking real values, the "median trick" is a simple way to reduce the probability of failure to any threshold $\delta > 0$, at the cost of only a multiplicative $t=O(\log\frac{1}{\delta})$ overhead. Namely, if the $\mathcal{A}$'s output falls into a "good range" $I=[a,b]$ with probability (at least) $2/3$, then running independent copies $\mathcal{A}_1,\dots,\mathcal{A}_t$ and taking the median of their outputs $a_1,\dots,a_t$ will result in a value falling in $I$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ by Chernoff/Hoeffding bounds. Is there any generalization of this "trick" to higher dimensions, say $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the good range is now a convex set (or a ball, or any sufficiently nice and structured set)? That is, given a randomized algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ outputting values in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and a "good set" $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\mathbb{P}_r\{ \mathcal{A}(x,r) \in S \} \geq 2/3$ for all $x$, how can one boost the probability of success to $1-\delta$ with only a logarithmic cost in $1/\delta$? (Phrased differently: given fixed, arbirary $a_1,\dots, a_t\in \mathbb{R}^d$ with the guarantee that at least $\frac{2t}{3}$ of the $a_i$'s belong to $S$, is there a procedure outputting a value from $S$? If so, is there an efficient one?) And what is the minimum set of assumptions one needs on $S$ for the above to be achievable? Sorry if this turns out to be trivial -- I couldn't find a reference on this question...

There is a second proof, somewhat more fun, given in that short note (credit to John Wright for pointing it out, and emphasizing it's the "fun" one). Here it is: Proof. Again, we will analyze the behavior of the empirical distribution $\tilde{p}$ over $m$ i.i.d. samples from the unknown $p$. Recalling the definition of total variation distance, note that $d_{\rm TV}({p,\tilde{p}}) > \varepsilon$ literally means there exists a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ such that $\tilde{p}(S) > p(S) + \varepsilon$. There are $2^n$ such subsets, so we can do a union bound. Fix any $S\subseteq[n]$. We have $$ \tilde{p}(S) = \tilde{p}(i) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i\in S} \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbb{1}_{\{s_j=i\}} $$ and so, letting $X_j \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \sum_{i\in S}\mathbb{1}_{\{s_j=i\}}$ for $j\in [m]$, we have $ \tilde{p}(S) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m X_j $ where the $X_j$'s are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p(S)$. Then, by a Chernoff bound (actually, Hoeffding): $$ \mathbb{P}\left\{ \tilde{p}(S) > p(S) + \varepsilon \right\} = \mathbb{P}\left\{ \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m X_j > \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^m X_j\right] + \varepsilon \right\} \leq e^{-2\varepsilon^2 m} $$ and therefore $\mathbb{P}\left\{ \tilde{p}(S) > p(S) + \varepsilon \right\} \leq \frac{\delta}{2^n}$ for any $m\geq \frac{n\ln 2+\log(1/\delta)}{2\varepsilon^2}$. A union bound over these $2^n$ possible sets $S$ concludes the proof: $$ \mathbb{P}\left\{ \exists S\subseteq [n] \text{ s.t. }\tilde{p}(S) > p(S) + \varepsilon \right\} \leq 2^n\cdot \frac{\delta}{2^n} = \delta $$ and we are done. $\square$
