I have referenced an old external Cisco article on how to block Bit torrent traffic referenced on-line Here This procedure I have found only works 50% of the time. I find blocking bit torrent specific ports, and doing the regex do work, it just does not catch all the traffic. 

I use cacti to monitor bandwidth, and openNMS to monitor latency. If you are monitoring all the devices linked to this switch you may see a corollary between usage and the latency. (i know you said it is not a bandwidth issue, but you never now) I have seen lower-end switches sag under heavy usage, which causes a lot of latency. Do you have any "dumb" devices feeding this switch that may be the source of the sag even though this switch is not passing much traffic. Also with cacti you may be able to poll the CPU usage, and you may see a spike at the time of the latency. As mentioned above, MTR or neotrace are also useful to keep an eye on the situation and you may see where the latency starts, which may not be this switch itself. 

You can typically log into the customer premise equipment (CPE) by connecting to it via your web browser. (Yours is done like this). So, look at what your DHCP provided ip default gateway is (in windows open command prompt type ipconfig/all). Plug that IP address into your browser to connect. You may need to add after the address. Search based on your model CPE. Once in there, most CPE's allow you to assign your single public IP address to a device in your home network. You would apply that IP address to your router. From there, configure it as you wish. 

Class-Based Policing. Since you cannot administer the switch, you will likely have to match traffic based on IP access list with can be processor intensive. In any case search cisco.com for class-based policing for additional configuration examples. 

See Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) and Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+). This would allow you send some traffic across the redundant layer 2 link. 

Does anyone have more up to date regex for finding bit torrent traffic? Or does is this the limits of the ASA at this time? 

I am connecting to a 100Mbit WAN circuit, that is Burstable to 500Mbit. If I am going to use ASA traffic shaping on this, would I set the shape average to 100Mbit or 500Mbit? My main concern is protecting VOIP, while allowing file transfers access to the burst. Here is what I have so far. This is to match the Voice Traffic 

IPCALC is a handy tool on most linux boxes, or on the web here ipcalc You type in the IP and the mask and it will output the range, detailing the network, broadcast and the usable range. 

The cisco documentation claims that the ASA 5512-X does not support traffic shaping because it is a multi processor device. Why is this? Is shaping just inherently active? It seems like the shapper is a good feature, i don't understand why it is not available. To add more details, the shape command is not available under the class default policy, it is located elsewhere? Here is what I normally apply 

Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Configuration Guide, Release 12.2 Troubleshooting, Fault Management, and Logging You just finish your standard ACL statement with the keyword. The level of logging is configured per logging destination. Note this may negatively impact performance of your networking device. Use with caution. 

First, validate that you can ping from one router to the other. If you can't, the link between them is not up/up. If you can, the link between them is up/up. Once you've got the link between the routers working, you need to apply IP addressing to the endpoints (not the switches). Typically this is automated using DHCP which can be configured in the routers. Endpoints get an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway (and usually DNS servers). All you need in terms of routing on the default gateways is a static route on each one, telling it the LAN facing subnet which is accessible across the router-to-router link. 

I can barely put into words the problem I'm having, but I'll give it a go. I have a pfsense router on which I've set up openvpn to act as a client to connect into another network. This has worked flawlessly for months, but is now no longer working. I've made what I believe to be unrelated changes to the firewall and taken to few backups to be able to roll back and verify if they might be the source of the problem. I've tried moving the openvpn connection from udp to tcp with the hope of that fixing if the cause was a flaky connection. No diff. Utilizing the tunnel on the firewall itself seem to work flawlessly. Setting up the same tunnel on my laptop seem to work flawlessly. But when the tunnel is up and (different) units on my lan try to traverse it it does not work properly. The weirdest but most reliable example I have of the problem is pinging a remote unit. It works every second time. If ping works all packages in the same ping-run get proper replies. If I and try again every package fails instead. This can be repeated indefinitely. 

It's a matter of physics really. WiFi antenna's come in different flavors, each having unique characteristics. Line of sight is said to be required for WiFi bridging where a directional antennae are typically deployed. That's why these are often mounted high up above the tree line. In terms of omni coverage antennae often found in access points, Cisco's, for example, Aironet 9.5-dBi Patch Antenna Installation Guide tells us about WiFi signal degradation through various materials. Mounting the AP too high up has a negative impact on signal quality. 

Use TACACS+ for admin access to your networking devices. That's the tool for the job. However, those brand of firewalls may not support it. I did find a RADIUS setup guide. $URL$ Other than using that, just create a batch script (windows): $URL$ 

No because MAC addresses are easily spoofed. 802.1x is the proper tool for the job. With 802.1x, one of the connections methods could be, when you connect (whether wireless or wired), you are sent to a captive portal (aka splash page) via your browser where you can accept the terms of use, optionally enter a required password, etc. 

I've also done pfSense factory default reset, but it is still behaving weirdly. EDIT: Tonight internet is behaving weirdly again, even with the slimmed down config from yesterday. For example the first two connections work and the third fail: 

MTU has me a bit bewildered, but pinging shows that the limit of 1500 is probably honed all the way out iirc (please correct me if I read that wrong): 

I can't say I see anything differentiating the working packages from the ignored ones. Using the same tcpdump (more or less, adjusted for openvpn NAT) I have been able to verify that the ping packets that don't get any replies never reach the remote end. The ones that do do of course arrive as expected. 

I've re-installed pfSense, switched from nanobsd to normal install, but behaviour is the same. If I reload the page enough times it will load successfully eventually: 

But unfortunately(?) I'm currently unable to reproduce the problem. Which leads me to further believe that the problem was upstream. How can I prove/determine whether it is my box or the ISP that is the culprit? When I start changing the configuration (moving cables and such) the problem have a tendency to "snap back" into working shape for a while. 

The Cisco SFP-10G-BX40D-I and SFP-10G-BX40U-I SFPs operate on a single strand of standard SMF. A SFP-10G-BX40D-I device is always connected to a SFP-10G-BX40U-I device with a single strand of standard SMF with an operating transmission range up to 40 km. The communication over a single strand of fiber is achieved by separating the transmission wavelength of the two devices. SFP-10G-BX40D-I transmits a 1330-nm channel and receives a 1270-nm signal. The SFP-10G-BX40U-I transmits at a 1270-nm wavelength and receives a 1330-nm signal. The SFP-10G-BX40D-I and SFP-10G-BX40U-I SFPs support digital optical monitoring (DOM) functions according to the industry-standard SFF-8472 multisource agreement (MSA). This feature gives the end user the ability to monitor real-time parameters of the SFP, such as optical output power, optical input power, temperature, laser bias current, and transceiver supply voltage. 

#1 BGP is required only if the provider offers no other dynamic routing protocol. In this case, your BGP peering is confined to your VRF within the providers cloud and can accept/pass private subnets to your remote sites. #2 No.
