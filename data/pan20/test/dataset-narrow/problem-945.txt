I had this happen to me, only worse when I learnt the hard way not to put miniCDs into slot-load CD drives! I tried the below things, and eventually managed to get it out. Admittedly some of these have potential to get you into a worse mess than you already are :P 

Edit /etc/gdm/gdm.conf - where it says you want . You may also need to comment out in /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc. This should get the X server listening on TCP. Check if it is with . It should successfully connect but not show any output (or perhaps a daemon message?). What other troubles are you running into? What error messages do you get when you try to make it run? 

Do you plan to run more than one virtual machine at a time? If not, it's likely you'll be better of with the Dual-core, higher clocked CPU. For a very pertinent comparison see the article Comparing Intel Dual Core and Quad Core using VMark Edit: as DMA pointed out, what is best will depend on your usage requirements. If you tend to run several processor intensive things concurrently (or an intensive, multithreaded process), the extra cores may be better. When considering 'concurrent' this includes processes running inside the VM and outside. If most of the time the CPu is getting hit by just gcc inside your VM, and whatever else you happen to be running in your host OS, I'd say a dual core would probably suffice - especially if there are cost considerations. 

You can disable Incognito Mode in Chrome with a simple registry tweak. In regedit.exe, create the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome, with a single dword value, called IncognitoEnabled and with value 0. This has been deprecated, the correct dword to use is now IncognitoModeAvailability, with Value 1 for Disabled. When you next start Chrome the New Incognito Window option will be greyed out. Or you can create .reg file by opening up notepad, pasting the below in and saving it as eg incognito.reg. Once saved just double click the reg file to inport it. 

I'd recommend Xubuntu. It can run everything Ubuntu does - the only difference is the desktop manager. Just be aware that 10.10 is still in Beta so you mileage may vary. The stable release will come out on October 10. 

It's possible that some cookie(s) were set while it was in Colorado. Try clearing your cookies on both browsers and see if it resets the behaviour. 

ShoppyBag is not a virus. It is a social-networking / shopping site. They use the Google API to import your list of contacts and then send email to all of them inviting them. It's sort of like a chain letter, except that to send it out all you have to do is click 'agree' a couple of times. As for the secret 1 pixel image, this is a known way that they can determine if you've opened the email, but ONLY if your email client loads images in emails, which Gmail does not by default. I don't know of any way they can get your cookies, though it's possible there's some javascript in the email HTML to do something along these lines. I wouldn't worry about it too much - they can't access all your cookies. Best thing to do with shoppybag emails is ignore em. Delete em if you want, but there's no real need. 

You're 90% of the way there with the command. I understand that you need this to reflect any changesd made in an open instance of Alpine however. Unfortunately this is not easy to do, but I'll lay it out for you anyway. What you want is not directly possible because the changes to Message Status made by Alpine are done so in memory and only written out to disk periodically (at "checkpoints"). The mail command (and all variants) can only read mail information from disk, and cannot know of changes made in Alpine between checkpoints. So all you can really do is increase the frequency of checkpoints. The code to determine when to checkpoint is very complicated but from what I can gather the default settings: 

Yes, though it's likely your soundcard supports only one channel in. To do what you want properly, you probably want a decent soundcard that supports multi channel, plus some good quality microphones set up to catch the sound from the voices and instruments. There's a reason people set up studios, and there's a lot of reasons studio time ain't cheap. 

What you really want is for Alpine to write back to disk more frequently. Unfortunately the checkpoint_interval and checkpoint_frequency variables can only be changed at compile time. To do this you need to recompile Alpine, but with some configure options, namely: 

Microsoft Office 2007's 'Save as PDF' tool saves in PDF/A format. A PDF/A document is just a PDF document that uses a specific subset of PDF that is designed to ensure it is 'self-contained'. Ie it is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and hyperlinks). From wikipedia: 

This is not possible I'm afraid, as there is no support for MAPI-extended (aka Exchange protocol) on OS X. Even MS's own product, Entourage doesn't support MAPI, instead using a combination of IMAP and OWA to access mail. Just a note - Exchange support on the Iphone is done through ActiveSync, which is not used by Mail.app. Given this, I'm pretty sure Gmail doesn't even make mailboxes available using the Exchange protocol, so the discussion may be moot. 

If you have a managed switch or your router lets you view its ARP table you can get this from there. If the computer you have the IP for is online you can ping it and get its MAC from you local ARP table. A general note for the sake of others: it is not possible to obtain the MAC address for machines that are on a different LAN since Layer 3 protocols are used for addressing and delivery in this case and MAC is Layer 2. 

No and no. Assuming you're talking about passive headphones + mic with TRRS connector, there's no way it should damage your audio chip, and it is (almost) totally driver-independent. It's quite likely that you can plug your headset into your PC/Laptop and use the inbuilt headphones without any problem. Many recent 3.5mm TRRS jacks have been constructed to be compatible with stereo headphone (TRS) sockets) Note that you will not be able to use the Mic in your headset when doing this. To make use of the headphones AND the mic you'll need an adaptor to go from TRRS (mic+stereo) --> TRS (stereo) + TRS (mic) From the wiki: 

This is easiest done in a database using Joins, but you can do it in excel using VLOOKUP. First create a third sheet, and paste the 'dog, cat, etc' columns from sheet one and two into a single column in sheet 3. The use Excel 2007's Remove Duplicates feature to remove duplicates. Then in the second column, specify the formula =VLOOKUP(A1, Sheet1!A$1:B$100, 2, false) where A1 is the cell to the left of the cell youu're editing (on sheet 3) and A1:B100 is the region on sheet 1 containing data. In the third column you specify a similar formula, but pointing to Sheet 2, =VLOOKUP(A1, Sheet2!A$1:B$100, 2, false). You may need to sort the data in sheet 1 and 2, and the names on sheet 3. 

Transaction logs will keep growing indefinitely until they consume all available space. It's likely this is one of the causes of you running out of space. You can truncate the transaction logs to free up space, but be aware that this will remove your ability to restore-to-point-in-time or roll back changes to the DB. To truncate the logs, run 

The ASUS M2N-VM HDMI should have an onboard NVidia Geforce 7 series. Try downloading and installing the 64bit Geforce drivers. Install them and you should get a system tray utility that will let you rotate the screen. The link above says it's for Win7 and Vista only but Win2k8 R2 should be binary compatible with these operating systems. I've linked to the 64bit drivers since Win2k8 R2 is 64bit only. Let us know how you go. 

This is the Gnome Virtual Files System. All the reports I've read suggest you can delete the contents with no ill effect. Note that parts of the folder may not really be taking up the space they are reporting, as they represent virtual filesystems. 

Edit: Since there aren't really any tools to test if a PDF is PDF/A, it's a safe bet that just like you, your university also has no way to test that the document you send them is PDF/A. It's likely that the only reason they specifically request it is so they can be sure that all the content will be "there" when they open it. They just expressed this requirement rather cryptically (And badly) as being that it had to be PDF/A. So a simple way to test if the PDF meet their true requirement of self-containment is to transfer the PDF and view it from another (preferably offline) computer and ensure that everything appears as it should. 

Can you post (redacted) copies of your server and client config files? Otherwise can you give us a basic idea of the network architecture? 

Depending on the VPN design, you'll probably need to include the following server config directives: 

If they're running Ubuntu, why not use Ubuntu One? It's design specifically to do exactly what you want to do, and supports a few other cool use cases too. 

If the connection truly is restricted ie some ports are blocked, you'll have to "tunnel" it over one of the allowed ports. This sort of functionality can be provided by SSH tunnels or by VPNS. Hamachi is an example of a VPN provider that would do this for you - just make sure that 'the internet' and whatever you're trying to connect to see your Hamachi address not you ISP WAN address. To do this you need to make sure that outbound traffic prefers the Hamachi interface, which you can do by setting the priority of your network connections. Depending on how MapTool/ WoW work it may be that the net connection isn't actually restricted, but that it implements a crippled form of NAT, that doesn't support what you need to do. Or if you're trying to setup a server to accept inbound connections (ie connection initiated by others, not you), you'd need to setup port forwarding for things to work which obviously isn't possible here. In any case, using tunneling is the most likely means to succeed.
