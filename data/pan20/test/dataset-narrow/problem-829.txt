The traditional solution to a problem like this is for a permanent user account to exist with precisely the access levels and permissions required by the program in question. Network services (like apache) often run as their own user, with privileges distinct from those of a normal interactive user and significantly less than root. If root is running the script in the first place, they won't need to provide a password to su to another user, even if that user has a password. 

I have a number of VMs that were based on the same template, each with about 2GB of storage. They all share read-only access to a 50GB volume (currently via NFS, but that is up for negotiation). I want to package up that template and volume so that a similar arrangement can be reproduced in another virtualized environment. Ideally that package would be about 52GB in size, and would allow another admin to create an environment with an arbitrary number of VMs. How should I tackle this? Can I accomplish this setup, or something similar, using OVF, or do I need to use something more proprietary like a vApp, or even a combination of multiple archives for different parts of the problem? 

There is an option for expiring passwords in the user "profile" options in Local Users of MMC. Let me find a screen shot. $URL$ 

What is the best way to resize partitions on a server with a Dynamic Disk? I have 4 volumes in what appears to be 2 partitions. I have ghosted each of these volumes to separate image files. I will need to have the drive letters remain the same when the server OS boots back up. I know I need to use but I do not know how to make this work. Thanks. 

I'd second the option to do RAID 0 (stripe) with a hardware RAID controller. I quoted a video encoding server and the scratch drives are 15k SAS in RAID 0 and it chews through video like nothing else. 

$URL$ says that the node_name option also sets the client_name, but the formatting of the page makes me think that client_name might be a settable option somewhere. Can it be set differently or separately from node_name? 

Running a bash script involves running the bash interpreter (which will be a process), and that interpreter reading the file, then following the script inside the file. If a process owned by a user can read the file, then the user themselves can read the file. This leaves the only option being allowing the user to spawn a process owned by root, and having that root-owned process read your script. This can be accomplished in some distros using the setuid functionality, but it is generally considered a bad idea and can lead to security holes if the script has any bugs. 

I hope someone can shed some light on this one, I've been using the below code below to create a new PSSession for months and has been working perfectly! Until today where it has suddenly started giving the error: 

I've seen ways of connecting 2 regions to be a private network using AMI's but is there not a way to do this via VPC or DirectConnect. At the minute we have: 

Am I just thinking about the whole email this in the wrong way, is this normal what Sophos allows? Regards Liam 

I would have thought AWS had something in place to link regions but from a lot of Google yesterday, I've only found ways using linux systems to route the traffic. I'm fine with that if it's the only way, but part of me thinks there must be another simpler way? Regards Liam 

Is there a simple script I can use to give a destination folder and the AD group I want to use and it would generate a set of folders with the members of that AD group and delegate the proper permissions to those folders? I have gotten as far as and it returns a list of FQN's. Here is an example of what I am looking for... 

We are using nginx, right now 1.6 to reverse proxy our services to the client. We are also using Server-Sent Events, a layer on top of HTTP that keeps the socket open. Here is a piece of required config. 

I just registered a new domain last week. I associated it with my Google Apps account. Apparently, some spam bot is using it with fake account names to send spam and I'm receiving a ton of bounces. What can I do to help against that? I do have an SPF DNS record 

Surely this shouldn't be allowed as even although it isn't allowing full open relay e.g. sending to name@gmail.com. It is allowing me to spoof emails from internal sophos.com users to other internal sophos.com users, just the same as it does for my organisation? gmail blocks this as expected: 

But the code that now errors has been working for so long, no updates have been ran and no AD changes other than I changed my password last week. But this also happens to all existing AD accounts and even for a new administrator account. I can RDP into the server fine, Also tried restarting with no effect. I'm on a separate domain from the server's that I execute the code on. Any ideas as at the minute I've tried adding get credentials to my app but as powershell is called from within a Windows Forms .NET application the Get-Credentials popup doesn't appear to allow the workaround of asking for credentials each time. Regards Liam 

Does Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services support account lockout like how the full Active Directory domain services does? 

My Googlefu was failing me today. In the pane of IIS Manager, I needed to uncheck "Reverse rewrite host in response headers". 

This works well for most normal cases for URIs such as . However when I introduce special URL encoded values, things go south. When the URI is , is decoded and is passed to as . This isn't a valid URL. I've tried to work around the limitations of NGINX by using a conditional to match against and , but the results are either double encoded or unencoded. 

In the above case is . I have also attempted using from the set misc module for the second regex. How can I get NGINX to remove the path components in the same format as the client provided them?
