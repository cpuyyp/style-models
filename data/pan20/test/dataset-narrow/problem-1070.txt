I'd be surprised if there is an existing program that does all you want - without some level of programming effort. The Gnu diffutils can do some of that and there is a comparison of some tools at Wikipedia 

This is more complicated. Router2 will have a default gateway pointing to the Internet router but will have interfaces in both LANs. If the Internet Router provides DHCP service for the 192.168.1.x LAN, we must make sure that Router2 is configured so it does not also try to provide DHCP service for that LAN. Router 2 should provide DHCP service for 192.168.0.x. Administratively it might be better to make Router 2 provide DHCP service for both LANS and disable DHCP service on the Internet Router - but this may be a less resilient configuration. If a PC in 192.168.1.x tries to use Router2 to contact the Internet, Router2 will redirect the PC by sending back an ICMP redirect. If a PC in 192.168.1.x tries to use the Internet router to contact the PC in 192.168.0.x, the Internet router will issue a redirect but to do this it has to first be configured to know that router2 is the nearest route to that LAN. I'd typically do this by static config but you could let the routers communicate using RIP or another routing protocol and work it out for themselves. 

When part of a hostname contains a non-ASCII character (such as this), the browser converts that element to IDNA encoding. So the actual DNS lookup is www.xn--adids-m11b.com You can easily check this using wireshark or tcpdump and then clicking your URL $URL$ in a web-browser. The real Adidas use content delivery networks, including Akamai, as do many other large organisations 

If the data is important, it should always be kept in at least two separate places. When one drive in a RAID-5 array fails, your data can be lost completely if there is a second failure during the rebuilding of the data on the replacement drive. You might want to have a separate copy in case the RAID enclosure catches fire or is stolen. 

But replace with your The is a C shell history substitution means previous command. means third word (they are numbered from 0) 

The RS232 standard specifies +/- 3-15V If any device is advertised as RS232 and emits smoke when presented with a valid 15V RS232 signal, I'd say it is suffering from a manufacturing defect which the manufacturer should rectify at no cost to you. "RS-232 drivers and receivers must be able to withstand indefinite short circuit to ground or to any voltage level up to ±25 volts." - Wikipedia You could always ask the manufacturer? Update: The serial port on a Synology NAS is not RS232. "The serial port on Synology NAS boxes is using 3.3V TTL levels, which have to be converted into regular RS232 levels by a level shifter circuit." - NetBSD 

- from FreeUnixTips By using the command you should be able to view a list of programs run by users. 

Restore Defaults In the end, the easiest solution was to click the "restore defaults" button at the bottom of the window opened using the ☰,"Customize" submenu. 

I would use and to see what the differences are between the working and non-working scripts. Assuming the second "postgres" is a password, there may be something invisible that is preventing it being recognised - for example a Windows control-M (CR) line ending being used on a *Nix machine. 

A typical SOHO "router" incoroporates a 4-port ethernet switch. This works in the usual way a dumb ethernet switch works even when all the other parts of the box are sitting idle with nothing to do. A router only does routing if it receives an ethernet packet that has a destination MAC address matching the router's MAC address and where the ethernet packet encapsulates an IP-packet with an off-LAN IP-address. Two PCs communicating with each other via the ethernet-switch part will only create ethernet packets with each-others MAC address as the destination, not with the routers MAC address as destination. 

There is a Putty fork named Kitty, it's website includes instructions for doing exactly what you want. It does involve registry changes but these are accomplished by downloading a .reg file and clicking on it in windows explorer (with admin privileges I guess). 

WINE runs many Windows apps on Linux and OS X. You can run Linux apps in a Linux VM on Windows. See VMWare, VirtualBox, etc See $URL$ Using Cygwin "You must rebuild your application from source if you want it to run on Windows." 

As a comment reports, the above quotation was removed from the Wikipedia article on 25 July 2012. It is not clear whether AltGr+x=œ was always untrue or whether the behaviour changed to accommodate the use of Alt+x to convert preceding four hex characters to a single Unicode character. Some applications provide support for entry of characters beyond the simple accented Latin-1 characters. 

A typical tool is nmap - the free network-mapper. There are other tools. Don't use this on any network you do not own or for which you have not obtained explicit permission to map (ideally in writing). People who misuse these tools in a corporate network without permission often end up with a criminal record. 

As @slhck said, converting from one compressed format to another compressed format always results in poorer audio quality. To produce better or equal quality in smaller files you have to start with the original uncompressed audio material. @slhck answered a different and slightly more interesting question "which audio file format gives the best subjective results at 48kbps" :-) 

I'm pretty sure current versions of OpenOffice.org can read .docs and can write PDF files without assistance from CUPS. I'd just install OOO and use it's "export as PDF" feature. I'd leave CUPS alone. 

By a process of trial and error I worked out that, from the administration web-page, I needed to go into the "Mail Server" App, select "Aliases" and create an alias for each user. 

I believe some advanced network testers can do this. (Example?, Example?) It might be less expensive to plug-in a rasperry-pi, arduino with ethernet-shield or similar device. 

Windows doesn't put them anywhere. Mainly because Windows probably doesn't know which parts of an applications memory represent unsaved files. Windows probably doesn't expect unexpected crashes. Specific applications may store none, some or all of your unsaved work in temporary files. It depends on the application. 

The usual answer for Windows is to install a Chinese Input Method editor (IME). This can be done in the control panel under language settings I think. I believe the main Chinese IMEs tend to assume you can draw and read Chinese characters or know the standard PinYing latinizations of pronunciations in an official dialect. You could skip the above if you only need to cut & paste text-strings from elsewhere. Obviously, your choice of fonts may be a bit restricted (compared to ASCII). You may want to obtain and install some additional fonts to supplement those of the ones provided by Microsoft that actually contain Chinese glyphs. 

Have you tried making a BAT or CMD file that runs the browsers and provides the "%1" parameter. then associate that BAT or CMD file with the .html file extension. Update: For example: file allbrowsers.bat 

If the two OSs disagree, you could get the symptoms you observe. But note different distros have different config files so I'd read relevant man pages carefully. 

The "^M" was entered using Ctrl+V Ctrl+M and is the ASCII carriage-return (CR) character. Here we see that file f1 has three lines but no CRs so all line endings must be Unix style solo LFs. File f2 has equal numbers of lines and CRs so it is reasonable to guess that it uses the CR,LF line-endings as used by MSDOS and Windows. 

Your DNS service provider is hijacking "No such domain" responses in order to direct your web-browser to a web site where your DNS provider can sell your eyeballs to advertisers. They disregard the drive-by collateral damage this does to DNS lookups for anything that isn't HTTP (like your pings). 

Dynamic configuration Generally, Computers renewing DHCP leases provide the previously used address and are likely to be reallocated it. A change of IP address shouldn't matter as long as you use DNS names, and the DHCP server is used as your local DNS server. You can usually configure most routers to make DHCP reservations such that the same IP-address will always get allocated to each device (based on the specific MAC address burned into it's Ethernet adapter) Static configuration However for three or four PCs, static configuration is easily managed. With a large number of computers it can be tedious to walk around, logon to each one, configure static IP address, subnet mask , default gateway, DNS servers or local hosts tables, and so on. Keeping track of it all requires careful record keeping, keeping lists of MAC addresses and watching out for accidental IP-address duplication, knowledge of how to recognise and diagnose misconfiguration etc. With only four computers this isn't a problem. 

regedit can be used to export selected nodes (and all subnodes) in the registry. The resulting file can be run (Windows opens it with regedit) to add those entries to the registry. Do backups first. 

I'd open in a web-browser. In general you read the documentation for the package you are installing, if necessary you get the list of files that are in the package (e.g. ) and decide how to proceed from there. I believe the most common use of must be to install software packages. I'd then mostly expect to use to read about what I have installed. 

Some examples: Make a Website Highly Available with IP Failover, Heartbeat and Pacemaker on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) provides the ability to define an IP address resource within a cluster, and for it to failover from one node to another. The same principles can be applied to any front-end system, such as a load balancer whose job is to distribute incoming HTTP requests to web-server nodes in a server farm. 

It is possible to write a networking application which does not respect IANA's list of reserved port numbers. For example a malware author might deliberately use such a port. Many applications can be configured by the end user to use any desired port. Just because someone registered a port with IANA for multicast video doesn't mean that all uses of that port on the Intertubes are genuinely using it for the registered purpose. Maybe it's malware sending you credit-card numbers back to a zombie at 81.64.155.202. Maybe it is something entirely innocent. Maybe it is some peer-to-peer application (torrent) uploading or downloading some video or audio data? 

Of course this depends on exactly how you "open a text (.txt) document", For example, if you mean you run MS Word and use it's dialogue, you probably have a different problem. 

Otherwise the mail messages are probably gone (assuming you have no backups of server or Mac). Note: So far as I know, Exim provides SMTP (inbound or outbound or both) and delivery into local mailboxes on the server. For POP3/IMAP you probably have/had a suitable POP3/IMAP service such as Dovecot installed on the server. This shouldn't affect the answer. 

Perhaps because in cmd.exe you have to use double-quotes (") not apostrophe (') to delimit parameters. 

SUS is a newer standard that evolved from the older POSIX standards and encompasses them. There are actually many parts to the POSIX standards. So SUS and POSIX are not the same. One is a superset of (most of) the other. I wouldn't be surprised if there were several details of POSIX that have since been superceded or deliberately omitted though. 

What did you have in mind? More memory and faster processors will speed it up considerably. Not loading lots of addons may help too. Hard to quantify. What sort of netbeans operations do you need to speed up? 

At one PC, gathering data remotely The command provides a list of names of currently active Windows PCs in the same workgroup or domain. It will include Samba servers (i.e. PCs and other appliances running Linux with the Samba service enabled) Visiting each PC and appending data to a network share If you create a public share first (details depend on what login account you use an each of your 100 pcs) 

I believe Apps currently available in the iTunes store are for Apple products such as iPhones. Microsoft Windows PCs are unable to run them. 

See pfSense - Example setup isolating LAN and DMZ but each with unrestricted Internet access I haven't read the pfSense docs but I assume it is possible to configure one of the several Ethernet ports as a DMZ port with a separate subnet such that the psSense will isolate it's traffic from your LAN traffic and you then set rules to prevent compromised DMZ servers being able to initiate connections to your LAN devices. 

Wordpad If your aversion to notepad++ and other text editors is that they are not a standard part of all Windows systems, use Wordpad. It's not quite as rudimentary as Notepad. Wordpad will correctly read and display text files with with Unix line-endings. Other If you are averse to both the one-true text editors then notepad++ is probably a good choice. 

Back in the day there was Linux On A Floppy (LOAF) and Tom's Root Boot. However I suspect they are too super light weight for USB drives :-) Nowadays I suppose the equivalent is Damn Small Linux which will install onto a bootable USB flash stick. 

See $URL$ or you can perform 8 individual crop operations if the spacing/location or sizes of the receipts are not regular 

The Ethernet switch is optional if you currently only have one PC and no other Ethernet devices such as routers etc, domestic (SOHO) routers usually have a 4-port switch built-in. Example 1 Example 2 

Some graphics programs will distinguish between resizing and resampling. Both result in a new image with a specified smaller size but the latter uses an algorithm that produces a better clearer result. (For example, in IrfanView) There is of course a limit to what can be achieved. For example there is obviously no way of showing five vertical strokes in less than seven pixels. For monochrome text of any sort: 

If by "in Windows XP" you mean "part of a standard Windows XP installation and not some sort of downloaded application", you have in a Command-Prompt window, but it isn't pretty. 

Appendix 1 - A note on Transport Layer Protocols The only transport layer protocols in significant use on networks that use the Internet Protocol Suite are TCP and UDP. †Just for fun, I measured traffic on my (very) small LAN, which includes NetBIOS (over TCP), SSH, Rsync, Email, software updates, DNS, general Windows-box chatter and a few other types of traffic. Note also this statement in Google's FAQ for their QUIC protocol 

If the PCs are running Microsoft Windows you can usually use the transfer tool they provide for exactly this circumstance 

You can test this by cutting your full upc.biz URL and pasting it in to the certificate tester at $URL$ - though that is aimed at people who set up certificates in sites like upc.biz, not at people who access those sites. 

Update: If you want a rigorous answer, be careful about using vague terms like electricity. Note that (so far as I know) most electrical signalling systems used with computer peripherals nowadays look at voltage changes at specific frequencies, they don't look at current (c.f. current-loop interface). So it isn't useful to think of "current frequency". Note: I am not an electronic engineer. 

It isn't that your computer doesn't know how, more probable that the currently logged-in user doesn't have the required permissions to write to the location which your software is attempting to use. The solution might involve 

I believe Paint.NET is limited to 8-bits per channle but I don't have a reference for that. Mainstream Gimp is limited to 8-bits per channel. Variants of Gimp used by the film industry have greater bit-depth 

If you repeat the "Enlarge thumbnails" operation in Acrobat viewer, you can eventually make the thumbnails large enough to read text. Another option is to view two-up and zoom out but this only ever gives you two pages per row. 

Then in Putty go to Settings, Terminal, Printer to send ANSI output to. Choose the printer you just added to Windows. 

The "\" character is reserved for separating the names of directories (folders) from each other and from the filename. For example If I have a folder containing a subdirectory and I put a file named into I could refer to it as . If I were also allowed to put '\' in a filename, I could put into a file named and Windows would then have two different files in two different directories that could both be referred to by the same name . This would cause problems. Other characters also have special meanings and so are not accepted as part of the file name. 

You can use a tool such as Pandoc to convert LibreOffice ODT (and many other formats) to a plain text markup (e.g. Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, MediaWiki, DokuWiki, Textile`). A quick online test at Try Pandoc produced this: Markdown
