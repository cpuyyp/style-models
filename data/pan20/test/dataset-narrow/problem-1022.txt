Notice the space before the comma that is because the space is in the filename. The ', ' is formatting. But ' ,' shows the space is in the filename. 

Try e.g. rather than , that might work In batch files you have to use rather than The is only for the command line. Change all references, so I suppose rather than You should really have troubleshooted and tried even a simple for loop, like you'd then have realized it also worked in command line and not in a batch file and perhaps you'd have found out about the %% requirement. 

well, do you really know.. do you know what the difference between primary memory and secondary memory is. 

$URL$ says it is supported by PC and MAC there are loads of programs to split files, this one for the PC, called WinSplit $URL$ Any binary file splitter, a program that just reads the binary of the file and doesn't interpret it, doesn't add or remove anything. They should combine too. Also, to combine them on a PC you can use copy /B file1.a+file2.a then they end up totalled in file1.a so you may want to make a backup of file1.a if you want to keep it 'cos it'll get overwritten. If you use copy /B ..+..+..+.. to combine them. 

starting with the default, cmd /v:off then moving to cmd/v:on Most use cmd .v:off even experts, (perhaps because other things can be interpreted differnly with it), so i'm just using this to show you that you can try the !var! notation within cmd with it. 

I had the same problem.. It worked in Firefox (and check that it works in Firefox.. 'cos there is a setting in firefox to not use the proxy when doing a local address...so it can look like it works when it isn't, but here, it was working and I think it was working for you too. But as you say, not in Chrome) For me, the key was doing socks5:// before the IP. Otherwise It just assumes it's a regular HTTP Proxy. In Chrome, there are two ways I have run into of setting it to use a Proxy, including, a SOCKS Proxy.. a)setting it "within the browser" b)setting it from the command line To get it set from the browser, look where it normally asks for the IP and Port (wrench..settings..under the bonnett/hood..change proxy settings..LAN..) Then where it asks for an IP and Port- Don't just put an IP for IP. Put socks5://ip or I suppose socks4:// if it's socks4. This may not work for IE You can also tick the box that says use a proxy, then leave the field blank, click advanced, and enter the IP and Port for the SOCKS proxy in the box labelled SOCKS. This works for IE too. You can see it's set by going to chrome://net-internals To set it from the command line (use Everything by Voidtools to help you find the path!) C:\Documents and Settings\name\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrom lication>chrome --proxy-server="socks5://192.168.1.5:1234" You can use netstat -aon look for lots of connections to your Proxy port 1234 established, and there shouldn't be any connections to port 80 , if there are do tracert on them, they may be things you know that aren't from your web browser like dropbox or maybe logmein and so check that the browser is getting its pages through the proxy. this link was helpful $URL$ 

I haven't tested it though, and on my systems, On my Win7 system or my XP system.. While the keys are there, the name (IGMPLevel) isn't in my registry at those keys. So in my case i'd have to create it. 

Networking is a complex topic. And the terminology often isn't intelligent. What you have are devices with multiple functions.. routing is a function, modem is a function, PPP is a function. A network bridge and a network switch are functionally the same thing. Some say a bridge often has 2 ports and the network mediums differ, whereas a switch tends to have multiple ports and the network mediums are the same. The logic of what it does is the same though. So if you look up switching, that's the function. But also, they can get the name of router, or switch, even when they technically might not really need to do any routing or switching. For example, aside from juniper and cisco, who sell routers that do a lot of routing, the items sold as routers by others, are technically routers, but only just about. They have 2 interfaces and on one of the interfaces is a network switch. I recommend the book 'computer networking first step' by wendell odom. He has some ugly analogies but you can skip the analogies and he has some good stuff. A switch is receiving "packets" and changing the MAC addresses in them and redirecting them. But you could then probably simplify the device a lot if e.g. it has only one computer connected to it then there's more functionality there than it needs. Many of these devices, particularly older ones, you could typically telnet to them and get a console up, 'cos they not only run linux. So a Router might have a whole routing table in there but really since it only has 2 interfaces it could probably get pretty far (i'm not sure how far but perhaps pretty far), by simply saying if a packet comes in one side then send it out the other side. (unless it's destined for local). It perhaps doesn't technically need a whole routing table to do that. Maybe similar for "bridging" mode. If going from scratch from an electronics background you might be able to make it simpler particularly if it only has one computer connected to it. Also, I suggest you look into a PCI DSL modem.. That is a bridging dsl modem. As an electronics person, that may interest you. And when they say bridging that also means it isn't doing any PPP(logging in), so the PPP is then done on the computer from windows. As is it when a modem is put in bridge mode.. or it can be done by a downstream device.. e.g. by a "router" plugged into the modem where the router supports ppp. 

It's useful to use the word packet in the general sense, the electronic engineering sense, without much of the mess of ISO OSI "layer" terminology. One has a packet and it has information like source IP, dest IP, And after that you have some other fields that may be called the TCP segment, and they have fields such as TCP source port, TCP dest port. Added note- In slightly more complex scenarios, you might have two connections, and the same source IP accessing the same dest IP and dest port. but one connection would have one local tcp port, the other another local tcp port. That could happen if you have multiple tabs open in a web browser, accessing the same web server. Another scenario is if you have multiple NICs. Bear in mind that IPs belong to network interfaces (that's more accurate than saying they belong to 'computers'). A computer might have many network interfaces, many IPs. A connection happens between network interfaces. 

And in Virtualbox, create your new machine, then in the menu load your floppy image that you downloaded 

a good safe general way is to make a file of the directories you want to delete Then check the file has what you want, then make a for command that echos every line of the file. then amend it for the commands you want e.g. this line puts rmdir at the beginning of each line of the file or at the end of that for add /q /s to the rmdir %a already there i.e. use @echo rmdir %a /q /s. And then once fine with what commands it would be running, remove the echo part so another way is also using that starting method of making the file listing the subdirectories to delete.. So each line of the file can be amended to read the command to delete that subdirectory. Then use sed on the file to replace subdirectory x with rmdir x /q /s. So if you have the file called blah. see it has all the commands. to delete each subdirectory. if you're happy with it you want to execute it, you can rename f to f.bat and execute it. 

Not possible from pure command line output, (so you wouldn't be able to do as a program to show whatever as html would require changing the font size which would affect all text. The next question is whether it is possible in cmd, from within a program. (Some programs have their own environment within cmd that isn't part of the shell.. so e.g. if you ever ran Doom or Wolfenstein 3D or Wolfenstein then when you exit it you don't see the graphics hanging there in the shell, it just goes back to the shel.. similarly a program liek dosshell which was a file manager) So it might be possible from within a program within cmd. Games e.g. Xenon 2, have often had elaborate graphics, so must support fonts in theory. There was at one time a program by pcmag, called banner.exe which would display text in large size, with lots of extended ascii characters on multiple lines, so that'd be evidence that from pure command line output you can't. Another thing to think about is Tex, does any cmd version of that do it, it seems none exist. There's no PDF viewer from cmd.exe either. On the other hand, there are games with good graphics. The two famous command line web browsers are links and lynx, they're used often on linux, and both have windows cmd implementations. Neither of them show different font sizes. As you can see Here is an example from links, $URL$ available $URL$ 

This is cheating a little bit, because it involves you compiling a little program that helps do this. It involves a little simple c# program but mostly cmd. The thinking is, if only cmd included a program/command that when given a filename, it'd give give on one line, the file's full path and creation date/time. Then in cmd one could use a cmd's for command, applying that (show file's path and creation date/time) command to every file. So i've written a little program that can take a filename and show its full path and creation date/time. And then I use it in cmd. The program.. 

Home sees work. really the switches to know for SSH are -L, -R and -D And if you are connecting the client program to the listening port in such a way that the client program is on a different machine to your listening port, then it needs to be -R or Though bear in mind, that's for something like VNC, but if you did it for HTTP you'd only be able to view one site. There is -D which as you see is local. Some people are at home and want to access a server at work, and that server is behind a firewall they don't control. But if you want internet access, then you're at work, wanting to access a server at home.. Why on earth can't you do that? Try running the SSHD server on port 80 or port 443 at home, and do 

I would like to temporarily amend that to just a particular folder available I see an option here for adding a particular folder from the host as a folder on the virtual machine. 

Say you have Computer A and Computer B, then Computer A is said to have a port open, and computer B is said to have a port open. It's like an ID, the program would "open a port", i.e. it'd request from the OS that a "port" be set aside for its use. 

The fdisk.com link mentions a bunch of links $URL$ There seems to be issues, it mentions WARNING: Some computers require the use of third-party hard-disk- partitioning software because the system ROM BIOS does not fully support the drive parameters of the hard disk that is being used or because the hard disk has more than 1024 data cylinders. If you are unsure if your system supports your hard disk, consult your hardware manufacturer or the manufacturer of your partitioning software before proceeding. also MS-DOS version 3.3 can address multiple hard-disk partitions, with a primary DOS partition of up to 32 MB and an extended DOS partition containing logical drives of up to 32 MB each; and MS-DOS versions 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 6.0, and 6.2 can address multiple hard-disk partitions with sizes up to 2 gigabytes (GB). Here is the Dell link $URL$ but it's broken.. most haven't included it but fortunately it looks like the script is still available here $URL$ $URL$ and is copied here: 

So is a bit of a cliche In Windows, is handled by the command, so is not a cliche. Note- Seeing some comments, I would add, there is a risk running * then ENTER. If you have a file called rm that is first in the directory listing, then it's dangerous because anything after it would get deleted. Also, and this is less unlikely, if the first file in the directory listing is the name of a script in the path, then it will run that. 

Does this apply to you? $URL$ looks like it may have a power saving option, with fan speed options. icon possibly in control panel. somebody here mentioned for his VAIO $URL$ "If you open up the VAIO control panel, youll see power management, click on the +, then select power options, when the power options properties opens up click on the "VAIO POWER MANAGEMENT" tab, look under system, thermal and you can choose "performance" or "quiet". I have a BZ VAIO and my fan was very loud but since I put it on quiet its hardly noticeable, my temps are around 95f, very cool!!" 

For what purpose.. If you're trying for an exam or course and want to know properly for your own interest too, and you want to know the technicalities..you should look first at what a hub is, then look at what a switch is. Any book will do that. Computer Networking is a very complex subject What counts also is what kind of product you have.. many people have a product that mixes features like modem-(2 interfaces router wan and lan)-switch, in one, and if you want to extend the network you have, you just plug a switch in the switch and then plug computers into the switch new switch. If it's a really big network or you want to start controlling things so computers in one subnetwork do/don't communicate with computers in another, then you need a router or VLAN Switch.. ( a VLAN switch may need or be part of a product that has a router built into it too). But some of these things are advanced networking devices that need to be configured. If you were an admin of a large network and had to extend it.. then bear in mind the hierarchy.. computers plug into switches, switches plug into routers, routers connect to each other. And there'll be a lot of configuration. If you are talking about your own network and it's not huge then just plug a switch into the switch you have. No configuration required. Not a pricey switch. Just plug and go. All those ports on the NAT router people have, are switch ports. 

When %errorlevel% is >=1 then it means error. So you can test IF %errorlevel%==0 You can test IF NOT %errorlevel%==0 You can use an ELSE The other syntax for testing ERRORLEVEL, don't do if errorlevel 0 (silly) 'cos that asks the value is >=0. You say IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (i.e. if the value is >=1) , or IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 (i.e. if the value is not >=1 i.e. if the value is 0 or less - and I doubt it could ever be less). Or you use the %errorlevel%.
