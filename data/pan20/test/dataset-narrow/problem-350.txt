how can I use the NULL value inside this concatenation? every answer says something to replace the null with or , But what I need it this: 

I'm using 1433 because a long story. but its working. We can use the default port 1433 AND IPAII ( for PHP developers ) with 1433 too. But in production, when I changed, the server lost connection. There's no way to explain this in a easy way. Why I had no problems on one servers, but on another, it lost connection? If the question is to abroad, I can get it better. 

EDIT2: I could fix this error ( it still shows me this error, but if I run the mirror again, it shows me error .) Using didn't solve the problem. it just restart the task, and errors and errors again. 

Well...We solved the problem. There was an Update, inside the procedure running that "select * from...". I commented the update. no more problems. 

So, How can I use this 3 union all, inside a procedure, as a single field? The purpose of this, is to select all data from these 3 selects, and grouping by , get the minimum value ( ) I tried to create a procedure and call it inside this procedure, but failed. 

I've been changing values but with no success. The same config I have in this server, I have in other servers. 

I'm trying to create a Trigger, to alter collation of a database on its creation, but how can I catch the database name to use inside the trigger? 

We're trying to achieve better reports using native tools from SQL Server 2014. I'm a DBA, and I don't know so much about c#, c++ and etc. I know also, that we have Analysis services, SQL Server Data tools, but, long story short, programmers here where I work don't care about anything. They don't want to learn. Is there a way to help my company, being a DBA ? I love to learn but I have some doubts about what service I can use to achieve reports with graphics, and those reports that bosses love. If this is a bad question I can delete it with no problem. My past job, we had an awesome application that uses views and procedures to ( I helped them with views and procedures and query tunning, but not with Visual Basic code ), in real time, update graphics and etc on a web page ( it was awesome ) but we can make it here, because as i said, they don't know and don't have the motivation to learn. 

$URL$ From the official manual. But I don't want to generate manually the properties with the software. I have already all properties of extended properties from almost all tables. Or can I make a Data Dictionary with my good SQL Server Management Studio? I can only see reports from disk usage, performance metrics and etc. This is what I have for now: 

Today I got an error ( DTSER_FAILURE ) but I could fix it by editing the maintenance plan ( this error is due to the maintenance plan searching for a database that was deleted, and I was using "selected databases" in the setup ). But over the internet, I read some posts saying that I should . What effects has this option? I read on the Microsoft page that this option has no effect and it is deprecated. 

inserts into an table that already exists. put data in a table that you will create in the same action ( whitout the need to create column by column. You should use something like this: 

EDIT 2: With some tests, I see that these queries shows me last backup date, even if I only have log backups. Is there a way to list "last full backup" date?? 

Edit 1: With James Anderson's query, I got this too ( filtering with ) Again, I don't have backups from 2015-09-15, only 2015-09-14. 

is a many-to-many relationship between tables and . In this query, mysql will find all posts tagged by any of these words, and order them by PRIMARY KEY. How can we order the results by tag weight: 

is not enabled by default. Normally, it should be enabled by placing in . But it does not work for all installations. In my experience, it worked for Debian 7, but not Debian 7 minimal, though both installations come from the same precompiled deb package. Both on OpenVZ VPS. How to debug why does not work for an installation, and how to safely activate ? 

In a project, we need to frequently the tables to delete or add columns. I wonder if this weakens the database performance in long term. If it has a considerable negative impact, what is the approach to keep the database healthy and efficient? I was thinking of the following approaches: 

The slow performance for using in large table has been widely discussed in various blogs, and the most efficient way is to use an as 

I want to search for the occurrence of each country in the column. I use multiple subqueries to do so 

I want to SELECT rows in which there are duplicates against . For the example table, SELECT query should return 

I need to make heavy statistical analysis to deliver some data to users. Currently, I catch the data from mysql and process them via arrays. However, mysql temporary tables are quite better (extremely more efficient and faster than PHP arrays; obviously due to their mechanism). My tentative solution is to form a temporary table upon each request (i.e. connection) to import and process the data. However, I am not sure if there is a drawback for creating many temporary tables simultaneously? Can this make problem for the mysql server? Or I can use it as an alternative to PHP arrays in numerous simultaneous requests? 

and no special features is needed, just creating table and performing SQL queries. or other advanced features are not needed. 

Since, make the calculation for the entire column, apparently, I need to reset the value/process of after reaching the maximum item in folder. 

In this typical example, all three columns are . When the fails, I do not know which col caused the error to change its corresponding value. How can I make a query to change to upon duplicate error? 

How we can change two variables in one condition. For example, consider that when , we want to change not only , but also re-assign . In fact, regardless of the condition 2, we want to increase , if the first condition fails (the second part). Is it possible to re-assign two user-variable in a or we need to add another ? This will be equivalent to 

Since, it is a temporary table, I cannot use . How can I from this table to have pairs of key/value in each row? 

I want to SELECT or UPDATE to remove a row if the first or last (with id order) is (a given value). In other words, I want to skip the first and last row of a category IF . I cannot use as it is a table. 

I want to concatenate the objects if the sum of frequencies reach a value. Currently I am doing this in as 

I use table for calculation of temporary data, but tables in has a big limitation, which made it useless for me. A table cannot be re-opened in a query. This mean I cannot the table with itself, and add sub-query. It is almost impossible to process data without and . Thus, I must give up table. A possible alternative is to create and delete a permanent table on each script run. However, I think it is not good from database administration point of view to and tables. Is there any practical alternative to tables with possibility of re-opening the table?
