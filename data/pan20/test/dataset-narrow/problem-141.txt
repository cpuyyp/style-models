You could say the TCP/IP model is an abstract idea. The TCP/IP protocol suite is an actual implementation of the model. 

Data rate is data rate, regardless of the physical medium. A 1Gb connection has the same data rate whether it is fiber or copper. As @toddwilcox mentions, the advantages of fiber over copper are longer spans and electromagnetic isolation. Data rates are independent of the medium. Transfer rates depend on every link in the chain from source to destination. You can only go as fast as the slowest link. So to determine if a user's transfer rate will increase, you have to consider all of the components from the server to the user's computer. You may get a modest performance boost by fixing one bottleneck, but then you will run into another. For example, you may increase your network bandwidth, but you might then be limited by the user PC NIC, disk transfer rate, CPU, etc. The same restrictions may apply to the server too. Upgrading one component may require other upgrades too. For example, if you upgrade your network switch to 40Gb, you will need to upgrade your server's connection to take advantage of that. 

Many places, such as television and radio stations, do "broadcast" live programming over the Internet. The problem they all have is a matter of scale. Every connection (listener) requires a separate stream of data. So 10,000 viewers require the data stream to be duplicated 10,000 times. It doesn't matter if they are all watching in sync or not. The equipment and data circuit costs can be substantial. Multicast is another option, but as @Ronmaupin explains, it requires all the ISPs to cooperate. The costs would be substantial and they would only do so if it was in their financial interest. The advantage of Internet broadcasting is that broadcasters can identify individual users, and therefore charge money for the service, or collect information about you to sell to advertisers or other third parties. In traditional "over the air" broadcasting, this is difficult or impossible to do. 

Wireshark identifies the protocol based on several variables. In this case, it starts out assuming SSL, and then changes it as it goes through its dissection process. I notice that the good capture contains a handshake session ID, while the bad one does not. I assume this is one of the reasons the bad capture stays at SSL. In any case, it's clear these are two different client versions, and that's why you're getting resets. You can try allowing older SSL versions on the PA and see if that helps. Here's a link to a similar question on the Wireshark wiki. 

It's impossible to tell for sure, since you have chosen not to disclose the context of your question. But assuming you are talking about packet capture or flow monitoring devices, the issue is that, in a large network, you will be capturing or sampling at several points in your network -- there isn't one main aggregation point. Consider a large network with several exit points (Internet, extranets, etc), as well as two or more data centers. Where are you going to capture data? You can try to capture everything in the core, but that has problems: 

Change the default gateway of all the PCs on the 192.168.1.0 network to be the IP of the server. Create a static default route on the server pointing to the ASA 

I'm going to try again, now that I think I understand your requirements better. I think you want to allow inbound connections to the DMZ, but deny outbound connections from the DMZ 

It is only a problem if you have more than one mutual redistribution router. In that case you will likely create a routing loop. In larger networks there may be more than one router redistributing between two routing domains (in this case, BGP and OSPF). If R1 and R2 are both doing mutual redistribution, a problem can occur when R1 redistributes OSPF into BGP, and then R2 learns those redistributed routes via BGP and then injects them back into OSPF. To prevent this type of problem you can use route tags to filter redistributed routes so that routes injected from OSPF into BGP (for example) are not relearned into OSPF. Here is a Cisco document that explains this in more detail. Note especially the section "Avoiding problems due to redistribution." 

It could be the load balancer or several other things: Most APs slow down with more than 20 clients. 

Static routes will not be advertised unless you redistribute them into the OSPF process. The basic command is 

Each line in the ACL creates a Securty Association (SA) for the VPN. Because you are using dynamic VPNs, the SA doesn’t get created until the remote router sees traffic that matches the ACL entry. You apparently have devices on the 192.168.0.0 network that are talking to the 192.168.11.0 network, and this creates the SA for that entry. But you don’t have any devices on the 192.168.50.0 network talking to 192.168.11.0, so the SA never gets built. With no SA, you can’t send traffic from 192.168.11.0 to 192.168.50 0. Once you ping from 192.168.50.0 to 192.168.11.0, the SA is created and you can send traffic in either direction. To make this work the way you want, you have three choices: 

You are mostly correct. As a packet gets forwarded from host to router, to (another) router, to host, the mac addresses change at each hop. But the IP addresses do not change -- they are the original destination and source IPs. 

In order to connect two areas, one router has to serve as an area border router (ABR). That router has interfaces in both areas. In other words, the boundary between two areas is a router, not the link between two routers. In your example, you could configure R1 so that interface f0/0 is in area 1, while the other interfaces are in area 0. That will make R1 the ABR for area 1. 

If you consider the TCP session as a stream of bytes, the sequence number is the ordinal number of the first byte in the TCP segment. So the first byte in the first segment is 1. If there are 100 bytes in the segment, the first byte of the second segment will be 101. 

IPv4 and IPv6 are separate protocols, so attacking one doesn't directly affect the other. That said, the techniques for NA spoofing and ARP spoofing are very similar. If you have the capability to do one, you certainly could do the other. 

This question refers specifically to Cisco devices. Other manufacturers use different terms (just to add to your confusion). There are a number of physical and logical "ports" you can use to configure a switch. The console and aux ports are physical ports on the device. Both use RS-232 as the physical medium and protocol (here the terms medium and data link get fuzzy). 

You may want to segregate your servers into different VLANs to simplify access control, apply QoS, limit failure domains, etc. An L3 switch will make this much easier. While Firewalls can run routing protocols, they don't seem to do it as well as routers, except in the most simplest of cases. Network management features are usually more mature on routers than firewalls. In many organizations, firewalls are administered by the security team (a bad idea, IMO), so they need to get involved if routing changes are needed. It's better if network routing is controlled by a single administrative group. 

The speed (data rate) of your wireless connection is negotiated between the access point and the individual client, based primarily on signal to noise ratio (SNR). It can be (and often is) different for different devices on the same access point. The factors that affect SNR are distance from the access point, obstructions, antenna orientation, and transmitter power, to name a few. 

Yes, but it requires rebooting the router and having console access. You can google "cisco password recovery" for detailed instructions. 

It doesn't, specifically. EIGRP calculates routes based on the advertised metric, which includes the delay value. Here's an example of how it's calculated. 

First, let me clarify: the switch does not learn addresses by flooding. The switch learns addresses by examining the source address of each frame received, then updating the MAC address if necessary. The mac address table lists each mac address received and the associated port (among other things). So your switch would have an entry for mac D listing port 3, and an entry for mac C, also listing port 3. Now if the switch gets a frame destined for either C or D, it knows to forward it out port 3. 

If you look at the class notes, you'll see that #4 says, "perhaps." Some data link technologies are reliable, most are not. The reasons are mostly historical, as many technologies were created for voice and then re-purposed for data. The reason we leave guaranteed delivery to higher layers is that many applications don't require it, and to put it in a lower level adds overhead where it isn't useful. 

Yes, but most importantly, classful addressing (i.e. fixed length subnet masks) is obsolete and has been for at least 20 years. I don't know why networking classes still teach it. There are many, many resources on this and other stack exchanges (as well as the Internet) that explain how to use variable length masks. 

Simply put, there are no more IPv4 address available. All (or nearly all) the available IPv4 addresses have been allocated. The explosion of IP devices, laptops, phones, tablets, cameras, security devices, etc, etc, have used up all the address space. 

You are using the wrong command. command defines the source IP when starting an SSH session from the router. It has no effect on other traffic. To control who can SSH into your router, you use an ACL and access-class. 

In the context of WiFi networking, mobile devices don't know they are mobile. They are assigned an address (their "home" address) which is part of a IP subnet (their "home" network). When the device moves and connects to a different subnet, the local router is the foreign network. 

The answer is, obviously, that isn't the case. The router acts like any other host: It looks in it's ARP table for the host MAC address, and (in the case of Ethernet) encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet frame, with the destination MAC set to the MAC address of the desired host. 

Whether one should use two firewalls or a single, three-legged firewall to create a DMZ is probably more personal preference than anything else. A single, three legged firewall works in 95% of the cases and is obviously cheaper and easier to manage than two firewalls with two rule-sets. On the other hand, two firewalls, if they are different brands, might protect against a (theoretical) vulnerability in one brand. Unless your firewall is doing some sort of packet inspection/malware detection, the benefit of a firewall over a simple access list isn't that great. Ultimately, it makes little difference whether you use one or two firewalls as it's vulnerabilities in OSes or users that result in the vast majority of attacks. 

Change the server Fa0 to 172.16.1.66 255.255.255.192 The default gateway is 172.16.1.65. Fa1 has the original address 172.16.1.3 255.255.255.192. No default gateway. Change the router interface fa0/0 to 172.16.1.65 255.255.255.192 You will also need a static route on the router: 

A good question, as there is a lot of inaccurate information about this. EIGRP neighbors exchange data from the EIGRP topology table. The routing table contains routes learned from different sources -- EIGRP, other routing protocols such as OSPF and BGP, static, and connected routes. To include these other information sources, you need to redistribute the other source into EIGRP. 

The results are weird because your addressing is not correct. You have two hosts with overlapping address ranges. One host has a /16 mask. The other has a /24 mask, but it falls within the range of the /16: 130.190.4.30 is an address within the 130.190.0.0/16 subnet. This is an incorrect configuration. Your hosts need to be on two separate subnets (i.e. without overlapping addresses), or they need to be on the same subnet with the same mask. Two hosts on the same subnet should agree on the mask. For example, you can change the PC on the right to have a /16 mask. Then your PCs can ping each other. If you want two hosts on different subnets (ex., change the right pc to 130.191.4.30/24), then you need a router to route between the two subnets. The router needs to have an interface in each subnet. You also need to set your default gateway on each PC to the address of the router interface on that subnet.
