you said that you don't want to use "thread" because your whole game sleeps. I think you are referring to Thread.sleep(). This is just one static method in the Thread class. The main purpose of the Thread class is to allow parallel execution. So the idea is to execute the image loading code in parallel to your normal processing. 

Normally the main compatibility issues are between major versions. If you compile for Java 6, it will not run on Java 5 but throw an java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError. So a program complied on Java 6 Update 24 is supposed to work on lower versions of Java 6. But there is a small risk that you invoke a method that was added in a minor release, resulting in a java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError or one of its subclasses. The chance for this to happen is really small, usually you get away without explicitly testing older versions. Stendhal targets Java 6, but tries to be mostly compatible with Java 5. Over the last year the number of users with Java 5 has decreased a lot. I think that is because of the huge improvements Sun made to the automatic update of Java. It is now around 0.1% for us, so we are considering dropping support for Java 5 completely. 

Minecraft I have not played this myself, and I don't know if there is a restriction on number of players which might be too low for "massive multiplayer". 

I have got it working now! I just missed one vector difference and one multiplication. here is the code: 

the fun is the line where get calculated, because there the tween functions come into play and it is possible exchange them against each other, what makes it very easy to test different easing. Btw: It is working for dynamic bodies too. 

Goal is to tween the body based on a fixed amount of frames: in frames. The value of is always between 0 and 1 and the only thing that is not working correctly is the resulting distance the body travels. I need to calculate the multiplier for the direction vector. What am I missing to make it work?? Greetings philipp 

as you might expect, I have got a game in development, including a main character—fortunately… This character is on the one hand represented by a bunch of Box2D bodies and on the other hand, graphically, by a bunch of SVG-Elements. The character is a floating one, a kind of Hovercraft, basically based on this tutorial, but more sophisticated all in all. The character can jump, too. To visualize the impulse, which gives the »jump-power« some fire blow out of its very ass straight ahead, what should be animated, during its short visible time. Question: How to animate that bespoken fire? I could use plain css, or JavaScript, or even SVG-Animation Tags themself, BUT I would like to ask for the preferred weapon of choice, faced to the fact that time is running out (less than 3 days) AND flexibility needed for the customer? Intentionally I am not posting any code, since I can imagine a solution based on each one of the methods mentioned above, this question is meant to issue the pros and cons, due to time and flexibility. In this case, all graphics (world, fire, ass, character) are given in SVG and are meant to be displayed as that, whereby the connection between physics and graphics is established by the use of R.U.B.E. I am searching for the most painless way of realization for the ass on fire. Thanks for reading and kind regards to the community! 

In Stendhal our loot tables are lists. Each entry contains the name of the item, a min and max quantity and the probability. The internal structure is very similar to what we display on the creature's webpage. It is important for us that game designers who have a great knowledge of the world can define such things. That is, without understanding complex logic at the program code level. So we don't have the definitions of creatures and items in the program code but moved them to .xml files such as elves.xml or club.xml. We do have a gui editor for them, but most game designers modify the .xml file directly. In order to make creatures and items easily extendable, we use a building block system: There is no program class for "elf" or "archer elf". But there are a number of behavior related classes such as "coward", "patrol", "aggressive", "archer", "healer". Designers can define new creatures be selecting those behaviors without writing program code: For example to create an "archer elf" draw an elf sprite with a bow and define it as "offensive", "archer". Then define level and similar attributes and add some elvish items to the loot table. For items we have a similar approach, but it is currently limited to one behavior: A designer can add a new item and define a behavior such as "ConsumableItem", "KeyItem" or "AttackItem", "Spell", "Scroll" without having to program logic. 

This example probably still needs some tweaking to make it just like you want, but it should get you started. 

You can change the price at any time, or make it free if you like. Also, you have the option of uploading your app under a different name. This is done often as demo/pro versions, where one is free and the other is paid. 

You can use the dot product of a world up vector with an up vector relative to the player. If both of these vectors are normalized, you're results will be between 1 and -1. With 2d vectors the dot product is calculated by taking the product of the x components and adding them to the product of the y components. Given the vectors and . The dot product is . So, if the world up vector is (0, 1), we can see that: if player up vector is (0, 1), then the dot product of the up vectors is 0*0 + 1*1 = 1, and, if the player up vector is (0, -1), then the dot product is 0*0 + -1*1 = -1. This tells us the player is upside down. If the player is standing on the side of a wall (1, 0), perpendicular to the world up vector. Then the dot product is 1*0 + 0*1 = 0. So, to recap, if the dot product is 1, the player is up right, as the dot product approaches 0, the player becomes more and more perpendicular to the world, and is perpendicular with the result is 0. As the dot product turns negative, then player's head starts angling towards the ground, and the player is completely upside down when the dot product is -1. 

whereby line 6 is corrected with . Since Javascript is not typesafe this mistake totally broke the simulation of the bodies, instead of throwing an error. 

I have a Box2D project and I want to tween an kinematic body from position A, to position B. The tween function, got it from this blog: 

I am developing a little Game with something like particles, where every particle is represented by a box2d Body. To insert new particles I need to find a place in the b2World where no bodies reside. How can I obtain this? greeting... 

I have an box2d project with some bodies in it, which move around without any user interaction. But if the user selects one of the bodies, he should be able to move it around just like he wants to. To keep it short, I want to change the type of the body to "kinematic" while the user controls it and back to "dynamic" afterwards. If I do so the rotation center of the body changes with the change of the type. How can I reset this? The body's fixture is created of a single b2PolygonShape, with its vertices set via SetAsArray(). Greetings philipp EDIT:: So I looked around about setting the local center of bodies. what brought me to this solution: 

I am about to create a Jump'n'run game using Box2D for the physics. I am asked to add a Dropshadow to the main Character, but as I noticed this could become quite complicated. Basically the Light should be parallel with an angle of 90°, so from top to bottom. Please see the image below. 

The Thread.sleep(500) call will now only put the new image loading thead to sleep while the rest of the game continues to be executed. Note: I assumed that you need the delay in order to keep load on the server low. If the delay is needed in order to wait until the image is loaded completely on the client side, a different approach would be better. 

I'd suggest to keep things apart. In Stendhal which is a 2D MORPG written in Java, we did the following things and it works out pretty fine: 

In Stendhal we solved the performance issue by adding game events to a queue and then processing them asynchronously in the background. In our case the events are not just records but objects which have a little bit of logic because in some cases we need to do two inserts with a link between them. For example the first time a item is handled in game, it needs to be inserted into the item table first before an item-event can be logged. But writing the log is only one side of the problem: What questions do you want to answer with the logs? It is easy to just read the complete log in chronologically order; or to filter it for one player. But there might be questions like: 

Probably the easiest way is to alter the A* heuristic. Once a tile has been used in a path, increase the heuristic for this tile so that the next pathfinding call will try to avoid that tile. This will also make the zombies gather around the player. 

It is unclear as to why you are using a perpendicular. There isn't enough detail to describe the problem you are working. However, perhaps this will help. A 2D vector can be described using the values (x, y). The left hand perpendicular and the right hand perpendicular are easily calculated. The left hand perpendicular of (x, y) is (-y, x). The Right hand perpendicular of (x, y) is (y, -x). This can be easily seen with an example. On a grid where positive y is up, and positive x is to the right, a normalized vector pointing up can be written as (0, 1). The left hand perpendicular of (0, 1) is (-1, 0). The Right hand perpendicular of (0, 1) is (1, -0), or (1, 0). 

Your code only makes a single test with before advancing. This skips over certain nodes that are in a straight line. For example, if you have 5 points (A->B->C->D->E) all in a straight. The smoothed path should only contain two points (A->E). In your logic you test if you can travel between A->C and if you can then B is eliminated. You then check to see if you can get from C->E, and if you can then D is eliminated. Here you reach the end of the path and you are left with an extra waypoint (A->C->E). Because you are moving your further down the path at ever iteration you are not eliminating all possible waypoints. You should check to see if you can walk between and , if so, mark for deletion and advance to . If you cannot walk between then advance and . 

Right now, the movement of the character is implemented so that forces and impulses are applied to the chassis body. Especially if there is an Impulse to the left or right, the desired tilt of the robots body comes to happen, but it fades away when the velocity becomes more constant, or acceleration comes closer to zero. What can I do to keep the robots body tilted, when it is in motion? 

I have created a jump'n'run browser-game based on SVG. The »World« grew large (~80px * ~20000px, before scaled to viewport height) and rendering went slow. In consequence I included a range searching algorithm to exclude elements from the render tree, if they are out of the visible area. To get all elements inside the viewport, I am using a range query on a AVL-Tree. Basically the approach was very effective and increased the performance up to 40%, unfortunately it also results in flickering of the graphic if the player is in motion. The initialization looks like this: 

where t is the current value, b the start, c the end and d the total amount of frames (in my case). I am using the method introduced by this lesson of todd's b2d tutorials to move the body by setting its linear Velocity so here is relevant update code of the sprite: 

There is some confusion as to what the parameters for are. This function takes two values. The documentation list them as , which I think the confusion is coming from. It can be read as (and it should be) from here to there. If you are thinking of these parameters as points, this from here to there idea gives you a line. However, if you consider the parameters to be vectors, then what you are looking at is an angle. This is illustrated by the purple arc. 

One thing you can do is not let the character travel diagonally when the path crosses the corner of a wall. The character is free to travel diagonally out on the open, but not next to a wall. This is done in your a* algorithm. 

Following along with the other suggestions, you can use the screen width to determine the left or right side of the screen. I might also suggest using a dead spot around the balloon. Precision touching can be difficult. if you split the screen on a single column of pixels, touches near this divide might get registered on the wrong side of the line that the player wants. This bit of pseudo code assumes that the balloon stays in the center of the screen and the background moves. 

As mentioned above, the framerate increased between 20% and 40% on each platform, but flickering and kind of sloppy rendering began. What could I do to gain a more fluent rendering? 

I have got a floating character, which should be a robot like thing, floating over the ground, whereby I am using the »hovercar« effect described here. Zhe Image below outlines the basic setup of the physics 

I have a Box2D project that is about to create a view where the user looks from the Sky onto Water. Or perhaps on a bathtub filled with water or something like this. The Object which holds the fluid actually does not matter, what matters is the movement of the bodies, because they should move like drops of grease on a soup, or wood on water, I can even imagine the the fluid is mercurial, extreme heavy and "lazy". How can I manipulate the bodies (every frame or time by time) to make them move like this? I started with randomly manipulation their linear velocity, but I turned out that this not very smooth and looks quite hard. Is it a better idea to check their velocity and apply impulses? Is there any example? Greetings philipp 

what actually is modifying the private data of the body. But it works and no errors appear, but can I really do this without the risk of breaking the application, or in other words, under which circumstances could this solution might cause errors? n.b.: I am using box2dweb of the latest release.
