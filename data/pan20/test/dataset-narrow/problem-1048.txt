Windows 7 SP1 64 bit ISO or fresh install can't talk to Microaoft because of the new update mechanism. I would like to slipstream the requisite updates into a USB stick installer. I have the requisite update(s), but all guides point to software no longer posted to do the slipstreaming. NTLite looks like it can do slipstreaming, but it's only patching the host OS, therefore, I'm not aure what its purpose actually is. Guides only mention RT se7en, and the 64 bit version is MIA. I found the x86 version though. If I want to slipstream updates into a Windows 7, how do I do that? 

It looks like the Creator's update pushed out and/or reset new stuff from Microsoft. I have uninstalled and disabled UWPs as much as I can, along with Cortana and Edge. Yet today I saw a weird green bar popup saying something about "Press Win + G to bring up the game bar". I figured it would have to do with the Xbox UWP app, which I have previously uninstalled. I presume this is UWP functionality, but I'm not sure how to find out for certain. Can this app or program exist outside of the UWP ecosystem? Is it a part of the Xbox app? What method(s) are there to remove it? Is there a prophylactic to prevent such things in the future? I'm currently stuck in Windows Home, even though I tried to upgrade to Pro (not me, but gives you context). I will be fixing that sometime soon. 

Like most new Firefox features, the only thing I want to do with them is turn them off. Firefox 42 or 43 implemented this new search/preview/magnifying glass thing, and trying to search The Internets for a way to turn it off has not been fruitful thus far. This link talks about Chrome as far as I can tell, and it's from 2010. The feature I'm referring to is very new. Is there a way to turn this off? Usually there's a setting in about:config that disable the new features that they roll out. 

I've been reading articles about high framerate displays, about how some of them cheat and don't actually work at 120/144hz, and also about software that seemingly fixes those problems. Most software just sets the framerate from 60, as it was before the new display was connected, to whatever maximum it now has. Above that I've found some info on increasing graphics card update rate. Supposedly it should improve perceived update rate on a display that doesn't support as many fps as the tool would say it shows. For example, people say that 74hz on a 60hz display looks smoother than before. I can't objectively test it myself, and I don't know much about the technicalities of that. How truthful is that? Is it just the placebo effect, or is there some sort of non-v-sync'ed tearing from converting 74 frames down to 60 which seems smoother? 

I'd like to automate some things by starting an app when a USB wifi router is plugged in. How do I detect that in Windows 7? 

Use Skype's detailed call information to see the average bandwidth used. For voice calls, it is usually pretty low, around 2-8kbps, video calls will of course use more bandwidth. If you want to know how much bandwidth Skype uses per hour in your specific case, just use any internet traffic monitor apps to see how much bandwidth Skype uses and talk for a few hours to get more precise data. Or just use Windows' standard Resource Monitor utility. Press Start button, type and hit Enter. Select the Network tab and you will see how much bandwidth Skype is currently using: 

It will kill all executables starting with that name, so make sure you don't just type something like because that could obviously kill critical processes like . Also, the flag is for killing the tree of processes, which is the target process and all the child processes it spawned. It may not be necessary most of the time. 

I have been running into this problem in Firefox for years. I use SessionManager to be able to recover after I forcibly crash Firefox and restart it, because I haven't found a reliable way to prevent Firefox from gorging on memory. There are plenty of extensions that purport to plug the memory leaks, though they usually only last for so long before Mozilla changes things to break them. Today, while being irate at this issue and looking around SuperUser, I found an article that seemed to have something useful. 20 minutes in, and memory usage has stayed around 500mb, and it was ~3GB before I tried the setting. I did have to crash and restore Firefox though. I think the magic came from one or all of these settings: 

Completely uninstall Firefox via Programs and Features Reboot Run a cleanup utility like CCleaner. Manually remove the leftovers and profile folder if you have to. Install from the 56.0.2 executable you downloaded. Verify it works with a new profile. Restore your backed up profile (Mozilla Support) 

when PowerPoint opens, I would like for it to show me a blank presentation with no preformatted text boxes like the following, preferably with multiple blank slides (use case below): 

I have a WRT54G and I loaded OpenWRT 10.03 to it according to this article. There was no Wi-Fi after loading it, so I connected via Ethernet and can log in to the LuCi interface. There's an option to enable Wi-Fi. Enabling it does not enable the Wi-Fi. Resetting the unit to factory defaults does not enable the Wi-Fi. I don't see much on the web nor Super User about this problem, so I'm guessing I did something wrong. I will try resending the firmware again. What else can I do or try to get things working? I don't see any instructions about how to configure this (like a 1st time Wi-Fi config), from what I can tell, it should just work. EDIT It turns out that this particular file will not enable Wi-Fi by default. Therefore, you have to connect wired and turn it on. I did several loads/resets, and loaded to v3 and v2.2 to determine this. 

old solution using AutoIt Note: this solution may cause stuttering and occasional freezes on older CPUs or at full CPU load. I whipped up an AutoIt script which detects the cursor within the notes list area and if you scroll up or down, makes a click on the "up" and "down" buttons on the scrollbar. This works with multiple OneNote windows. You don't have to have focus on the window for the scroll to work, just hover over that list: 

I have the same exact motherboard and this error is familiar to me. Indeed you have a bad battery on that board. It can't keep the BIOS settings saved anymore. You need to replace it with a new one for this message to stop appearing. Or ignore this message altogether if you don't need any non-default settings, it's safe like that. (at least nothing happened to my computer in 6 years) 

This is very bad. How do I return it to the previous state, where the menu options and bookmarks do not cover the top of the drag area and it's big and you don't need surgical precision to drag the window? 

This seems to be a pre-boot options menu. It appears most likely either because you have an installation media such as a USB drive with Windows 10 on it plugged in or a DVD in the optical drive, and the computer is set up to load from them first. It should not appear if you take them out before starting up. Or it could be because you have done a compression and this got added as an additional boot option. In this case you can remove it after booting into Windows and pressing WinKey(to the right of the left Ctrl)+R, and typing in . That should open a window like this: 

I know I can choose not to download specific files in torrent clients, but that is not enough precision in some cases. Sometimes I know roughly the time range within a movie where I wanna look up a specific scene, but I can't select downloaded chunks with more precision than the whole file (in uTorrent, at least). Are there any other bittorrent clients that allow this, or is there some other way that I can do this (plugin, perhaps)? 

I am trying to reverse engineer a protocol in Wireshark, and I'm not that familiar with Wireshark. I have found some of the packets that I want, and I can see the XML data in the Data View pane. I would like to get it out of there so I can clean it up and read it and start figuring out what is required to use it elsewhere. Are the dots after every character a part of Wireshark, or a part of the protocol I am looking at? I am presuming Wireshark, so part of the reason I want the data out of Wireshark is to clean up the data. What can I do to accomplish this goal? I finally figured out how to multi select packets (CTRL + M), which is ridiculously tedious, but worked because I have a small set of packets to work with. Printing them does not give me what I want, and exporting doesn't seem to do what I want. Of course, it's entirely possible I am screwing up those operations because of n00bishness. Update I found this article that explains how the feature was purposefully obfuscated. Well, I have found it anyways, but now I'm just getting a representation of what i saw in the data pane. I would like to just get the ASCII that is there. Is there some way in Wireshark to output this? It would be nice to mash up some packets and get their reassembled payload, like the receiver would send to the application server. See below for graphic (courtesy of this question on Stack Overflow: 

I have written some VBA code in an Excel Spreadsheet (Excel 2016). I was working in a sample spreadsheet, and now I want to easily transplant my VBA code into the real spreadsheet. Copying/pasting the command buttons doesn't carry over any of the code. And I'd rather not do a whole bunch of manual copypasta. I know that you can export a single module/class, but I have not found a way to export everything all at once. Do I need custom vba code for this? Some kind of add-on? Or is there a process built into Excel somewhere that I missed? I have a few userforms, modules; and a few buttons on a worksheet. I could do it manually, but I'm worried about making mistakes in the future if I have to do it again. The autosuggessted question, even though the title is 180 degrees from what I am looking, does not apply. I tried to copy the worksheet to another spreadsheet, and the VBA code did not copy over. The sheet and the buttons on the sheet did though. META While asking this question, I got an automated "This question appears subjective and is likely to be closed". I assure you, this is not subjective, although it is probably a very n00b level question. 

The whole bar became a solid color, which didn't seem to be the average color of the whole bar. Pink, light-green and turquoise were prevalent, with much rarer brownish-tan and purple. Yellow only seems to occur right after the index becomes greater than 256. The weird thing is this persisted even after reloading uTorrent application and rebooting the PC. After the download completed, availability index lowered to 14 and the bar returned to normal. Naturally, I wanted to check things out again, so I deleted data and re-downloaded the torrent to see if this keeps happening. It does. Is this a bug or an intended feature? If so, what do these colors signify? 

Not sure about other versions, but in Windows 7 you can simply create a shortcut in your user folder (for example, ) and name it whatever you want. You can then press Start with your mouse or hit Winkey and type its name to start the linked application quickly. You can add custom launch parameters in that link if you want. Also the link stays in your user folder and this means other users won't be bothered by its existence, in case they want different things to run after typing the same short name. If for some reason the search function is disabled on your Windows and you don't have the search bar in Start menu (maybe because of some silly corporate policies) you can still launch that app but through the Run window, which is called by the key combo WinKey+R, type the name there and hit Enter. This is my preferred way because it doesn't take even that part-second to "find" the app link through the search bar. 

I've noticed that my display with HDMI input shows a very slight, just barely visible pattern on dark colors. Sometimes it's vertical lines, sometimes it's a plaid-like square pattern, sometimes it's like random noise. But these patterns don't animate like noise on a TV, they're static as long as the image is static. I tried playing around in Photoshop with 1 bit changes in colors and I managed to produce different patterns. It's very hard to make a good photo of, but here's the test pattern image: 

The workflow is misnamed because I started with a sample called "pingparrallel" and have been trying to understand worflows. The original script tried to use a particular ping class, and that didn't work. How can I pass in the IP address of the device I want this 2nd party cmdlet to process correctly? Does it matter that that 2nd party code is using runspaces? Asking the manufacturer for assistance probably won't go so well. It's a pet project of theirs, response times are slow for this technology, and I used to work there, so I have the inside scoop already. 

Is there a way to prevent Lastpass from logging me in to a website while in private browsing mode? Ideally I would like to keep autologin turned on for regular browsing mode, but turn it off for all sites by default in private browsing mode. Windows 7, Firefox 

Your modem or router could be coming under attack and that glitch is the device going down or shutting down the port to protect itself. 

I'm relatively new to Crystal Reports and I'm testing out various report viewers. When I made my report in Crystal reports, apparently I used an OLE DB connection to the data source, in this case SQL Server 2008 R2. I was watching a tutorial series from Lynda and then Infinite Skills to get started. I'm testing the report viewers on a Windows 7 VM (Pro 64 bit, SP1). I developed the report on a different Windows 7 machine (Ultimate N, 64 bit, SP1). According to one of the devs of one of the report viewers I was testing, it seems that the built in OLE DB connection is failing or "missing drivers". I don't see any downloadable drivers like with PC hardware, and it seems that the two terms, while supposed to be different, are used interchangeably in practice. Is there a practical difference in the access methodologies when used with Crystal Reports? Should I just switch to ODBC and be done with it? Update 1 I've been continuing to work on this, and it appears there is more than 1 OLE DB driver in Crystal Reports. In using a different OLE DB driver, the 3rd party reports are able to work, but there is a popup from the Crystal Engine to enter in credentials. In using one of the report viewers, it seems clear that the credentials for the datasource connection are not being embedded into the report.
