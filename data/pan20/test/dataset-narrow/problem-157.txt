This is mostly a semantic problem. From a physical point of view, most connections you will see are point to point -- there are very few physical multipoint media types (I would propose they are all obsolete). From a logical point of view, however, many technologies act a a multipoint networks, where any endpoint can directly address another at the data link level. 

Here is a short answer: A L2 VPN acts like a layer 2 network. That is, all the devices that connect to the VPN would normally be on the same subnet, and broadcasts go to all devices. In a L3 VPN, each site makes a L3 point to point link to the MPLS provider. Each site must run a routing protocol (or use static routing) with the provider to reach other sites. Another way to think about it is, a L2 VPN acts like a virtual switch, while a L3 VPN acts like a virtual router. 

TCP and UDP are layer 4 (transport) protocols. They always use IP as the layer 3 (network) protocol. The text you quote is just plain wrong. You may notice that the page you reference was marked for cleanup. That should indicate that you should be suspicious of the accuracy. 

They limit broadcasts by breaking up broadcasts domains They limit L2 failure domains, caused by misbehaving NIC cards They provide a convenient handle to apply various policies such as security, QoS, etc. 

The only thing that would cause a delay is congestion on the network, although those delays would be in the milliseconds. It's possible that congestion will cause packet drops, and the retransmission would cause noticeable delays. Unless you are doing other data intensive things on your private network, you are unlikely to notice any delays. 

Vlans are layer two constructs. Subnets are layer three constructs. In all but a very few exceptions, you have one subnet per VLAN and vice versa. 

There are two interrelated issues here: coverage area and channel bandwidth/utilization. Multiple access points will extend the coverage area and improve throughput, because signals will be stronger and therefore your clients can operate at higher speeds. Even if your coverage is perfectly adequate with one AP, having multiple APs allow you to use multiple channels, and this will reduce channel contention and increase throughput. With one AP, all your clients are competing for airtime on one channel; with 3 APs on different channels, for instance, you have three times the channel capacity, and your clients will have greater throughput. If you have a modern wireless network with a central controller, it can influence how and when your clients chose a particular AP. Ultimately though, the client makes the decision which AP to associate with, and when to roam. 

Because there is no "state " in the network layer nor signaling for connection setup. Packets are forwarded based on destination address and each packet is forwarded irrespective of previous traffic. 

The switch boots up into the default configuration. Then it loads the configuration saved in memory. Thatâ€™s considered a change. 

The ARQN bit doesn't provide the sender with enough information to be used as flow control. ACK only means "I received the packet intact." I don't see how it could also be used for flow control. If the receiver receives the packet, but wants the sender to stop, what could it do? If it sends an ACK, the sender will keep on sending. If it sends a NAK, or sends nothing, that tells the sender the packet was bad. So the sender will retransmit it, making things worse. The FLOW bit means "I'm busy, please stop sending." 

Layer 2 switches are also called transparent bridges (OK, a long time ago), which means they do not modify the frame. They examine the destination MAC address and forward it based on their forwarding table. It is up to the sender to determine the destination MAC address. 

What you're asking for is called Policy NAT. You use an access list to define what traffic gets NATed. I don't have your configuration, so here is a sample of what you need to do. 

These terms are abstract logical concepts, much like the OSI model. Data plane refers to all the functions and processes that forward packets/frames from one interface to another. Control plane refers to all the functions and processes that determine which path to use. Routing protocols, spanning tree, ldp, etc are examples. Management plane is all the functions you use to control and monitor devices. These are mostly logical concepts but things like SDN separate them into actual devices. Finally, all manufacturers use these concepts. 

There is a lot of confusion regarding what part of the OSI model is in use here. Let me see if I can help: Remember that the OSI model is just a model. It doesn't represent anything in actual use. The TCP/IP model is a better fit for protocols in use on the Internet. The statement "routers are just depicted as having and using the networking protocols and IP" is an oversimplification -- and that's where some of the confusion comes from. Router software has the full stack in order to run routing protocols like BGP as well as management functions (telnet, SSH, snmp, etc). Is BGP a network protocol or an application protocol? The BGP process that runs on a router talks to BGP processes on other routers. BGP makes use of TCP/IP to facilitate that communication. It establishes sessions between peers and has its own messaging format and syntax. In that sense, BGP is an application that runs on a router. BGP's purpose is to populate the forwarding table of the router. When the router makes a forwarding decision for an IP packet, it looks in the table for the next hop address, adds the layer 2 header, and transmits it out an interface. That process only involves layers 1-3. So if you're talking about how routers route, that's all you need to discuss -- and that's probably where the confusion comes from. In summary, the forwarding of packets involves layers 1-3. the information used to forward packets comes from many sources -- one of which could be the BGP application running on the router. 

Yes. If you connect two vlans together, you have essentially created one VLAN. They are in the same broadcast domain and all hosts can address each other directly. That makes it one layer 2 network. The vlan names "VLAN 2", "VLAN 3," are local to the switch - they haven no meaning outside the switch. Although most switches don't operate this way, you could have the same VLAN have different tags on different ports. For example, you could have a VLAN that was tagged with VID 2 on one trunk port, but VID 3 on another. It's still the same layer 2 network. 

Unfortunately, Cisco did away with wildcard masks in IPv6. That is mostly a good thing, EXCEPT in this particular case. For your idea to work however, you have to rely on Facebook being both "clever" and consistent, which is probably more than one can hope for. But if you want to process Facebook's traffic differently than other traffic, you can simply filter on their assigned address block. The one you mention in your question is actually assigned to Facebook Ireland: 2a03:2880::/32. But it is just as easy to look up others in the registries. 

Many new networking students spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out "which layer" a protocol or function belongs to. It is a fool's errand, because whatever protocol you are looking at was not designed with the OSI model in mind. So you are forcing it to fit into an arbitrary model. That's fine, I suppose for entertainment's sake, but it won't really help you understand networking any better. Many protocols straddle different layers of the OSI (and TCP/IP) model. Is ICMP layer 3 or layer 4? Is ARP layer 2 or layer 3? Perhaps a little of each. MPLS? Don't get me started. The important thing about all models (here's one that things actually follow sometimes $URL$ ) is that there ARE layers. And layers have interfaces to the ones above and below it. So you can replace the functions of a layer with another, and as long as the interface between the other layers stays the same, everything works. So, for example, you can replace one layer 3 protocol, IP version 4, with IP version 6, and everything else will continue to work exactly as before, because IPv6 communicates with layer 2 (below) and layer 4 above) in exactly the same way as IPv4. The other thing to remember about layers is that, for the sender, a layer encapsulates the data (technically, the protocol data unit, PDU) of the layer above it. So layer 3 encapsulates the layer 4 data unit, layer 2 encapsulates the layer 3 unit, etc. The receiver reverses the process, decapsulating the data and handing it off to the layer above it. Sander's post about ARP, BTW is right on. 

BUT, there are a lot of things to consider about when and how you are redistributing. More details about your network would help with a more complete answer. 

While product recommendations are off-topic for this forum, you are correct that the firewall should be placed between the router and the rest of the network. The big change is that now the default gateway of all your PCs will point to the firewall instead of the router. Similarly, the router now points to the firewall instead of the internal network For those devices that are accessible from the outside, good practice says to put them on a separate network (called a DMZ) and a separate interface on the firewall. You should only allow the necessary ports into the DMZ from the outside. To implement a site-to-site VPN, a hardware router makes things much easier. You also want to limit inbound traffic from the VPN tunnel.
