Erratic behaviours are difficult to debug. I used Jaunty until last month and did not experience that. If I were in your situation I would probably try to see if newer versions of alacarte have been backported, and if yes, I would try to install them. Compiling the latest source code is also an option, if you really can't stand this behaviour. 

output to you? If it is a standalone program you will get the directory where the executable is located and thus probably be able to understand what installation is part of. If it is a bash (ot other shell) command it will silently fail (no output). 

Real need for processing lots of stuff. Run out of RAM and use of swap-space. Waiting for a service that either takes time to start, either fails entirely to start (so that the computer waits for the request to time-out). 

It seems that ~quack took the proposal of making a rc script and expanded it to a nice how-to in his answer, so you might want to try that instead of editing your file by hand. A doubt stroke me though: UFW is just a frontend for iptables, so you could check if iptables is using the rules you set for it. From the shell, type ; you should get the list of rules currently in use. For example I opened a few ports, and in the rules listed out I find them in the form: 

Maybe I got your question wrong and John T already gave the right answer, but I understood you referred to the system beep, the one you were used to get in the old good days when you would keep a key pressed for too long, under MS-DOS. :) If that is what you were asking. Then you have to disable the module responsible for that in the kernel (don't panic... it's dead easy!). From terminal, as root user (or by doing sudo): 

I always do fresh reinstalls, so I did not do the following myself, but I imagine that you could follow these steps: 

Once in a while, in random instance, a portion of my screen (maybe half of it) will blinking black patches for a milisecond. This happened even when I'm not in a game, e.g. browsing Windows Explorer, using internet, etc. I can't seem to track when and why it happens, but it seems to happen more frequently when watching YouTube. EDIT: This is what I mean by blinking black patches. Watch it slowly in the first few seconds... $URL$ 

Then what if I unplug the external hard drive, plug it into another laptop, what will happen to both the hard drive and the documents that was being opened if I do the following actions from the another laptop? 

If you have Adobe Photoshop at hand, you could batch resize the files in one folder. Open Photoshop, File > Scripts > Image Processor. Choose the folder the files are in. Or you could also do this online with: $URL$ 

Put my laptop into "hibernate" state instead of shutting it down Open the back of the laptop (I mean something like this) Pull out the hard-drive from the back Put the hard-drive into an external hard-drive casing, something like this: 

Is there a way to move my files from "My Laptop" (the old PC) to "My Laptop (1)" (the new PC) and let it sync there? The guide I found requires me to uninstall Drive in the old PC but in my case it's not possible (because of hard drive failure). 

Will it damage the hard drive or the documents in any way? I hope my English is understandable. Thank you for the answers. :) 

Might only be tangentially related, but there's also this weird continuous blinking every time I open this website: $URL$ (despite the name, it's not a weird fetish and 100% safe for work) Here's a short video depicting what I meant: $URL$ Curiously other HTML5 video seems to be fine. It's not exactly the same blinking with the one I've described before, but I'd lke to know if it's somehow related. Thanks! 

With a metaphor: for the same reasons for which you will go faster on a well lubricated bicycle than on a rusty one. Modern hard drives are smart enough to compensate for hardware problems, so - unless a core component is broken - they will find a way to keep running (this is so because HD's obsolete very quickly, and if they would stop working at the first writing error or corrupted sector, you would be changing your HD every few weeks). 

I recently purchased a Truly Ergonomic keyboard (model 209) that I use both at home on my GNU/Linux machine and at work where - very sadly - I am obliged to use an macbook air sporting the last version of OSX. While the keyboard is equipped with a few dip switches that allow to change the keycode of the modifier keys to naturally fit the "special needs" of OSX, these are too fragile to withstand daily toggling, and I therefore wanted to remap the keyboard via software, keeping the switches in their default position. The problem I am currently facing, is that OSX - differently than other OS's doesn't detect the pressure of the two extra keys of model 209: 

I don't have a definite answer to your question, as I never really felt the need for something similar. In ubuntu I commonly use do do special pastes (including "paste as simple text"). I just thought to mention it, in case you didn't know about this possibility. 

EDIT: Sorry, I missed your note about not being the bash break. :-| However I can't reproduce the error message you get. I get instead: 

You could create a script in . This runlevel is the same that starts system-wide services like pulseaudio or webservices... Upadate 

If it works and you are pleased with the result, you could make the change permanent (and easily reversible) by making a file with lines 2-3 from above in it, then making it executable (right-click > properties > permissions > Allow executing...), then adding this file to the list of files which get ran automatically when you log in (System > Preferences > Startup applications). There are other ways to make the change permanent by editing the scripts in but as I do not have an old installation, I would not be able to guide you through. Hope this helps! PS: For getting the best out of the new notification system, you should enable compiz! 

I want to remove the (dot) in line that has the word , but not on other lines. So it would look something like this: 

I hope I lay out my question/explanation clear, since English is not my mother tounge. Thank you in advance! 

I'm moving from my old PC to a new one because the old one is broken (hard drive failure). I still have my files in Drive (now Backup & Sync) and I want to import those files to my new computer. But when I install Drive in my new PC, it just creates a new directory. 

When it does connect, it runs really slow. However my other devices (smartphones) are okay, the problem only occurrs on my laptop, and my brother's laptop (which, oddly, wasn't touched by my cousin). This has never happened before... I asked my cousin what he did, but he claimed that he doesn't know and "it just works" for him. I know this lacks fruitful information, but I really don't have any clue to networking at all. May I ask for help? My router is linksys WRH54G... 

My cousin went into my home yesterday and he complained his laptop not being able to connect with the internet on my house (we use wireless connection). So he asked me to configure the internet connection, and he asked me to borrow my laptop too. I don't know what he did, but he succeed in connecting to the internet, but now my laptop is broken. There's a yellow warning sign on the traybar, it says IPv6 and IPv4 "No internet connectivity, and each time I try to diagnose, these errors appear often: 

I want to select whole line that contains the word . Fro the Search menu > Find, using will select whole line that contains the word . But using does not. What's the correct regex command? 

But, still, it hasn't been successful. The warning always appears and gives me a lot of headaches. I can't install anything. Any help? :/
