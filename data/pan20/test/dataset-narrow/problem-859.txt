I'm running a couple of iSCSI Targets with OCFS2. I had to reboot my iSCSI Target (the physical iSCSI Target) due to some hardware changes and it caused all the initiators to reboot. I want to prevent that or at least make them wait a lot longer before they reboot. Is there some sysctl variables I can use to modify the targets? I have multiple iSCSI Targets on my main system, due to need to share them out with multiple systems I'm running OCFS2 as the Filesystems on the Initiators 

I just check to see if the Currently Active slave has changed or not. Also if you are just looking to see if link is lost on one of your NIC's, you can still do that though SNMP or other standard forms of monitoring. 

Not only could you still perform your job function, but probably better than if you were using a Linux destop manager(on the server that is). As a Linux SA for the past three years I have yet to use Linux as a workstation and have never once needed to use X or any window managers on a server. I have seen a few servers running a full blown desktop manager before; always assumed the tech who installed it was clueless. I use mac as my workstation and keep a few virtual centos instances in parallels for trial and error. I run macvim as my editor and the rest is standard. 

For a quick change do: "MaxRequestsPerChild 4096" to something like: 700 will help. The longer an apache process lives the more resident memory it's going to consume due to mod_php and the like. Also, enable keepalive and place aggresive timeout settings for it: 

I'm using an asterisk VOIP server, and I'm able to make called though with my SIP client. The problem I get is one-way voice. I can hear the incoming voice but the caller can not hear me. I have no problems when using the X-Lite3 windows SIP client. I VOIP provider is broadvoice. Could it be something in the firewall rules that I need to fix? 

I was wondering who uses off site tape storage for their backups and their Positives and Negatives with each system. My basic requirements are secure storage, HIPPA certified, or SAS certified would be great. We rotate our tapes out every 6 months to offsite storage. I have looked briefly at Iron Mountain. 

Glad you solved it! Another method is to have the external server be part of the VPN. Then just set the domain/s to the servers new VPN IP instead of the public IP. This way all administrative access to the external server travels over the VPN as well. Plus no special routes or NAT rules. 

cloudburst attack is more or less a fancy term for "Host code execution vulnerability from a guest operating system." How do you protect against that? The same way you protect against every products security exploits, with updates/patches. What does this means if you are using some virtual hosting provider (SaaS, PaaS, etc)? Pick one whose core virtualization technology is well tested. Xen would be a great candidate since it's open source and therefore receives external code reviews. If you are implementing virtualization in house use the most recent stable version and implement any additional host protections possible, such as chroots, selinux, jails, kernel patches like grsec, etc. 

Is there a way I can convert an MBR partition setup to a GPT partitions with out having to destroy all my data? Thanks 

This has happened to me in the past. It Have you tried Different ports on the switch and a different Ethernet Cable. I've seen where a bad cable will give you link but not show you have a good enough connection to the pins to keep the signal of proper quality for higher then 10/Half. 

arp -an will show what you you are looking for. There is a time out for how long the MAC will stay in the table. 

What you are creating is a third level domain. This should help a bit. DNS just converts the IP address computers talk into names humans can use easily. The reason you don't have to specify the NS server is pretty simple. You have already specified them for example.com. r.example.com is just pointing to a different IP address. 

Run the above on the server and it should list which services are running and which ports they are "bound" to. If 80 is not listed then you need to troubleshoot the apache startup. 

If in fact it isn't what Frenchie said, which it most likely is, it may be helpful to look at that users mail. Cron mails output from cron jobs to the user account of that crontab. That is why you often see STDOUT and STDERR piped to /dev/null, so they wont be mailed output they don't care about. You can use the mail command as that user to check for mail with helpful output. Also, the /var/log/cron file may include helpful information. 

You need to create a snapshot of the data and import that in to your slave before you start the replication slave. Typically that is done with mysqldump. On you master check "show Master status", and on your slave check "show slave status". That will give you any errors. And follow what quanta link you to. 

I use Bacula, its free and open and works on Windows and Linux, and has extensive documentation on the linux and windows ports. As for Duplicati, I have never used it so I cant really tell you what do on that, but you that is an alternative. 

Another service you can use is CAcert.org. They offer free SSL certs, you may want to look at them I use them for some of my certs. 

Does the originating/source IP show up in that log output? If yes does that IP show any valid requests in the http logs? Perhaps a monitoring system of some kind is checking http on your server, since you said it was in consistent intervals. Just throwing stuff out there. 

You're referring to "incremental backups". Assuming your looking for something open source checkout bacula or backuppc. Backuppc can have a bit of a learning curve but it works great. R1soft is awesome (bare metal restores) but it is a commercial product. 

Listening services should be explicitly enabled not implicitly as is the case with core services on most servers. If you don't need ports 137,138, etc then disable the services so they aren't listening. Google "disable netbios over tcp". You can disable netbios services on a per Network Adapter basis. So disable them on the WAN for sure. First google result: $URL$ Also, as was stated previously you should only listen publicly on your webserver and only on those ports you are actually using. Use the windows host-based firewall to drop everything except tcp requests to http(80), https(443), DNS(53)(UDP). Also, is this internal network solely your own? If it is shared with other "dedicated" server customers or other departments you may wish to limit access by source IP on the internal interface to any netbios, core windows services. 

Bind is trying to to resolve ipv6 addresses from an ipv6 server. Is your server configured with IPv6? 

It sounds like there is some security that your system administrator setup. I would talk to your IT/System Administrators before you go trying to bypass the security they have put into place. There are a number of different setups that could be "blocking" you. 

This sounds like a Harddrive issue. Does this happen on all the laptops or just a few? Have you checked the Eventlog to see if there have been harddrive or hardware errors. One easy way to check and see if it's a hard drive issue would be to load up a Live-Linux CD and check for badblocks. Also I forgot to ask what type of hardware do you have for these laptops. That could be another factor to look at. 

The default configuration on most distros is going to be pretty secure. It's up to you to make it otherwise. ;) So before implementing custom htaccess rules, enabling symlink support, adding new modules, etc be sure to ask yourself how that change relates to security. Research that particular directive in the context of security via google and apache.org. The default configuration of Apache, though secure, may have modules and features you do not require. So you may wish to disable unnecessary modules, cgi support, ssi support, directory browsing, etc. There are a slew of articles available search for "hardening linux" and start with ones that don't include mod_security or re-compiling. I recommend testing each change as you make it so as to know which ones break your site. Also, often more important that securing Apache itself is securing the content Apache serves. Read about proper site permissions and the configuration files related to the languages used (php.ini). Sorry it's hard to be more specific without a more specific question. I obviously don't want to duplicate Google search results. 

I have been using Raid1 on linux with write's way over 15M/S. Those log messages are indicative of either a hardware issue with the drive, a bad Sata cable, or a bad connection on the motherboard. Does SMART reporting show any errors with the drive. I would check that and the SATA cable. Easy cheap solutions if it is a hard drive issue. 

What does show? Once you get the kernel names you can just Just make sure you do not purge your current kernel. The results can be unexpected. 

You can host multiple SSL based sites. You have to use SNI, and not all browsers support SNI, so you can have issues with an older web browser. Most modern browsers should support it. It's described in RFC-6066 This HOW-TO can walk you though how to do it.
