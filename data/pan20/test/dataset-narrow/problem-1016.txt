Some resources below to make your life easier: 1) Dual-boot-windows-7-ubuntu - dedoimedo.com 2) Dual-Boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu in Perfect Harmony - lifehacker.com These ought help you through the install process, and these guides require that you install Widows 7 first. 

I am looking for a simple software to track monthly expenses, jobs, etc which is as simple to use as Remember the Milk. I would like it to be offline, hence a desktop software. My operating system is Windows 7 

I would like to import .obj files into Google SketchUp with its textures, currently SketchUp only imports .3ds format. The current work flow that I use is to import the .obj file into 3D Max and export a .3ds file. The problem is that the file loses its textures and all that I get in SketchUp is the model minus the texture. Is there a free importer for .obj files in Google Sketchup or a free converter that can convert the .obj files to .3ds with the textures, so that I don't have to build the textures from scratch. 

Can you try getting a codec pack for another audio player and then try? For eg: get a codec pack for WMP, probably VLC isn't able to play it well. Edit: What player are you using to play this on your linux systems, if its VLC then i maybe wrong.. then its probably just getting an updated driver pack? 

It's just an annoying bug in Windows 7. I faced it on one of my laptops. I had to get the latest graphics drivers, but its didn't solve utill i did a full re-install of Windows 7 and then applied the latest graphics drivers You could get the latest drives and try to install them first, if all fails do a reinstall that ought to work out. It at least worked out on my laptop. 

Well you can use Acronis True Image or Norton Ghost that backup and restore your OS and softwares, although your OS might or might not support dissimilar hardware. (Acronis True Image does have a universal restore feature in some of its products, but I can't vouch for it as I haven't personally used this feature.) What I would suggest is do a clean install and create an image of this install which can be restored to a later date so you don't have to do the installation all over again. As for a backup of your older settings: There are lot of third party or free software that let you backup your settings but there are no guarantees that you will find such a solution for all your softwares. For eg: You can backup most Mozilla products using Mozbackup. One more solution is to google each software that you own and try to copy the files that hold your settings and you can restore them after your installation is complete but this is really a manual process. I wish there was an all in one software that could backup all your software settings but making such a software would require the creator to study different software storage patterns and write the software accordingly and the software would definitely need many updates depending on how often the software is renewed. If you want to copy your entire hard drive (data) to another drive you could use the clone disk feature available in Acronis True Image or simply connect both the hard-drive on one computer and copy-paste the old hard drive data to the new hard drive. 

I'll be going to a country side for a few days and the speeds there are pathetic! Which voice messenger uses the least amount of bandwidth in order to make voice calls to other pc's. Speeds are a little better than dial-up nearly 80-100 kbps 

I have currently looked at Untangle, I want to know if there are any other similiar projects which have add-on open source projects similiar to what Untangle does 

Edit: Also can I remote into any of the computers on the network to troubleshoot common issues (like grandma deleting the Firefox shortcut for the nth time and screaming "Google does not work any more") 

Okay got it this post helped me solve the issue, it wasn't Google SketchUp's issue in importing the textures it needed to link up in 3d Max. This is the text of the post that helped to solve the issue, just in case anyone else faces this problem. I merely followed these steps and the .3ds file imported perfectly textures et all into Google SketchUp: 

Have you tried SMF? you would need a few modifications to add features but this should meet your requirements 

This could happen if your processor fan is misaligned, or if your ram is not plugged in well or you have a faulty power supply. I would like to suggest a few steps: 

MS Excel export allows a csv (comma delimited) export. Is it possible to export my files from excel to .txt or csv files (all the cells in my excel file) delimited by "|" (without the quotes) instead of commas. 

I'd say anything 600 dpi up is pretty good for photos, nothing lower as when you would want to edit them the colors and resolution would not be good enough 

You can use TimeLeft, (its a free software) to give you popup's on your screen at a time interval you choose or at a specific time. Its not exactly what you want coz it won't grey out your screen but the alert should make you aware that you have to do something else. 

Some further reading for common reasons on why a computer could possibly keep restarting/rebooting itself. 

Found an amazing paid application to do the same after comprehensive searching here's a link to the website if anyone's interested. 

Why don't you use KonBoot, login into your admin user account and then change the password! You will need a blank CD and CD/DVD drive to burn the iso and boot from it. If you don't own a CD/DVD drive, here's a tutorial on how to use a pendrive for the same. This will be way faster than trying to brute force your own computer to find out your own password. Besides why use brute force when you can by-pass it way simpler. (And hopefully you own this computer coz I wouldn't want to try this otherwise) 

I don't think that this is currently possible. Vbuzzer does currently have support for MSN, AOL and Yahoo Messenger so that you can keep in touch with friends who have ID's on those IM services. But currently it doesn't support Skype, though if there is a round about way of doing this then i could be wrong. 

I am not aware of a direct method for equally distributing your bandwidth using only a router, but you can assign bandwidth priority for certain applications (web-browsers, bit torrent clients, etc) and that way make sure that you have enough bandwidth to surf. Have a look at this article it will give some ideas on how to achieve priority based bandwidth management for applications by configuring the QoS ruleset of your router. The article does recommend a router too but you can also look for other routers with the same specifications as the router could be an outdated model. (Also you can get a refurbished or a used model of the router mentioned in the article for around 50 bucks but I haven't checked up for other models in the same price range.) 

Obviously you want this machine to be your test-bed, so I'd suggest that you get a second hand PC or a second hand parts that way you could even play around with the hardware configuration and get exactly what you want for any specific application or operating system.. also a good way to economize. If you get a good bargain you could probably purchase extra spares too in the same budget that you planned, just be careful not to get duped. 

You can try Ccleaner. It will do all of this and more for you in a jiffy. And if you are not satisfied by the defaults, you can add/remove custom files and folders from the cleaning process. Here you can take a look at all its features 

My Dell Inspiron 1525 shuts down randomly, it's running Windows 7. I checked the error log and this is what the last error was: 

Conhost.exe is a new binary on Win7. It hosts the command prompt window that cmd.exe runs in. Source here 

When I point at any currently running software on the super-bar for a preview it lasts for less than 2 seconds, hence I cannot point or preview any software. It worked perfectly till i decided that I wanted a change of theme and then Aero stopped working so I troubleshooted for the error and then windows solved the error in the troubleshooting wizard, but the preview was limited to 2 seconds which is very little time or preview or switch running software's. Is there a way to manually increase the preview time ? 

Can you check if it can detect on any other pc or laptop, maybe a friends. You will also need to use a recovery software like Recuva in order that you can retrieve the data. And please stop using flash drives as your primary storage device, keep a backup somewhere if you do so. 

A playlist is like a database of the locations of the songs selected by you usually stored/saved on your computer like a text file so depending on the number of songs the size of a playlist file will just be a few kb. So it merely access the songs location and plays it accordingly (you are right in saying that its like a bookmark) It doesn't make a copy of your songs. 

A Freeware software does indeed exist to create custom mouse pointers. Its called Real World Cursor Editor and here's the article through which I found this free utility. The site also features custom cursor gallery, you can have a look if you find something useful. 

Do you mean that you want to copy your firefox 3.6 profile to firefox 4 (i.e. keep all your settings, bookmarks, addons,etc.)? If that is what you want to do this should help: Video of how to backup and restore your profiles in Ubuntu. (In short use the FEBE addon/extension in FF, if that doesn't work just copy your profile folder and paste it from the same place in the newer version you copied it from) 

The x tells Windows to not check that particular drive on the next reboot. At this point reboot your computer, it should not perform a chkdsk on startup and take you directly to Windows. When you are back in Windows you want to do a manual check disk on the c drive, to do this: 

Are there any free virtual webcam softwares which will display my screen instead. I do have my own webcam but am looking for an alternative through which any software can access this virtual webcam which will display my screen instead of me. 

I don't think its possible to assign 1 static ip to many computers on your network and expect them to connect to the internet. That's why you have NAT, to translate it to private ip's. If you have to connect multiple computers to your network to access they internet, they have to be assigned private ip addresses (the 192.x.x.x kind) either manually or by using DHCP,but it seems that you want to turn off DHCP. Why don't you want to use DHCP, what do you want to achieve here? Is you objective here just to share your internet connection? What is your current networking layout i.e. how do you connect to the internet? (directly to a modem or via switch > router > modem or via router > modem) Please do correct me if I have failed to grasp your question. 

I'll be leaving for uni soon and would like to know the different methods of connecting remotely to my home pc. I know about VPN but are there any other ways? Also how secure is each of this method as I wouldn't want snoopers on my home-pc especially when I'm away. Also can i set up a remote connection to start and shut down my computer My operating system is windows, but if linux is more secure i would be willing to switch. 

The new version of Skype is always stuck on my Super-Bar(unless i exit the program), which is really annoying. There is not option to minimize it to the tray at least in Skype options. Has anyone had this problem and figured out how to minimize it to the tray? 

Doesn't seem to be possible to customize notifications to appear on a monitor of your choice, but this thread should give you some insights on the issue. 

I have Adobe Flash CS3 and Adobe Flash CS4 installed on Windows 7 PC. The problem is that i can set the default to either of the applications but i can't seem to set it to open the appropriate file types. For eg: I want the files that I create in Flash CS3 to open in the same version i.e. Flash CS3, and the Flash CS4 files to open automatically in the Flash CS4 is there a way to do this? (i.e. If I am opening the files from windows explorer)

Recently installed CentOS on Gigabyte GA-G31M-ES2L motherboard everything works well except the graphics are a bit laggy, so I'm wondering if it hasn't got the drivers in place. Where do I locate the drivers for this motherboard as I can't find them on the manufacturer's site and they aren't located on the DVD that came with the motherboard. 

You will have to get to the router login page (by typing its ip address in a web browser), login in with the required credentials. Then browse to the wireless section and enable it. I'll have a look at your documentation and try to get you screenshots.
