Assuming you're using rsyslog, which is the default on Debian squeeze: Use rsyslog's mail output module to send yourself email. You can configure which messages get sent to you in the usual way: 

The reason this isn't working (and isn't going to work) is that iptables operates on the IP address of the machine that directly connected to yours. If you're using CloudFlare, this means you are receiving connections from CloudFlare, not directly from the end users. Here's an example, taken from one of my sites on CloudFlare: 

The bug you linked was closed as a duplicate of bug 552522. That bug then links to RHBA-2012:0255-1, which states the issue was fixed in . Unfortunately, you didn't tell us what version of your system has installed, so you'll have to do the comparison yourself. Make sure you have actually installed this or a later version. 

The field of an RPM is set by whoever created the package, usually the developer working on packaging it. The format is completely arbitrary, and one does not necessarily have any relation to another. That said, Red Hat will always put or in their field, indicating the major and minor versions of RHEL for which the package was built. 

In the long term you should probably find another router, the software for which is better supported by its manufacturer. (I'm not going to make any recommendations, though.) 

You forgot to set . The configuration file did warn you that you have to set this equal to the netblock of your local network. 

No, only destroys the metadata identifying the logical volume and the specific extents which it used. It is possible to recover the data that used to be in the volume, if specific steps were not taken to destroy it. This is a little better if you are using LVM thin provisioning. In this case, a newly provisioned LV will use no space at all, and thus reads from it will all return zeroes until something is actually written to it, in the process destroying the previous data. If your primary concern is VMs being able to read data from previous VMs, this should be sufficient. 

That's because your configuration seems to be telling it not to do so for any file with a digit 0-9 in the name. Delete this entire section; it's mostly redundant anyway, and almost certainly isn't doing anything that you might want. 

This will be the general process. See the man page and your own local configuration for the exact commands to use, if you don't already know them. 

Your configuration line doesn't contain the expected hyphen (). It instead contains an en dash (). It looks similar, but it's a completely different character. In fact, it appears both of them are en dashes. This can happen if you copy and paste from a web site which has unhelpfully changed hyphens to en dashes. To solve the problem, replace both of the en dashes with hyphens. 

It can filter on much more than email address, so you will probably have more than that to add to it. 

You're on your own for installing anything else. As @Matt noted, the motherboard form factor is SSI TEB, so you could theoretically install any board with that form factor, though you may run into other problems (like baffles not fitting back into place, etc). 

In the case of third party packages, you can also mirror those yourself using the command line tool, which downloads the contents of yum repositories to a local filesystem, and , which creates a yum repository out of a set of RPMs in a directory. Remember that repositories do not have to be on the network. They can be located on a local filesystem such as a hard drive, DVD-ROM or USB stick. 

Because it was not yet considered GA (stable) when RHEL 7 went into feature freeze (about a year ago). If you need it, MariaDB provide their own yum repositories, including (now) for EL 7. 

Your file is not readable by the PHP process. You can see that the permissions on the script permit only the user to read (or write) to the file, but PHP by default runs under a different user ID (e.g. or ). To resolve the issue, make the file world readable. You may also need to make the containing directory and its parent directories searchable. 

You need to apply an update to your NetScaler hosts as described in Citrix security bulletin CTX123359. Appliance firmware version 8.1, build 68.7 or later, and version 9.1, build 99.8 or later. 

If you used a partition as an LVM PV then it doesn't matter whether the disk was partitioned as MSDOS or GPT. LVM does not operate at this level; it doesn't care at all where the block device came from. 

First some background: Most Linux distributions shipping SELinux are using a policy based on the so-called reference policy, which contains a functional policy that can be used as a base for site-specific customization, or used as-is. The attributes you're looking at are: the SELinux user, the role, and the type (or domain) for the file or process. In SELinux, login users are mapped to SELinux users, and then the SELinux users are assigned to roles which they are allowed to perform. Each role has a set of domains that it can transition to. In this way, one can switch a user's role (users can switch their own role with the command, if they are allowed to change roles) to provide or deny access to a completely different set of domains. In the case of files, access to the file is mediated based on the user and role of the process matching the user and role with which the file is labeled. However, in the case of unconfined users, (and whenever you want, in your own custom policies) these may be ignored and only the type used, or the type ignored as well. If you're using the default targeted policy, user and role are almost entirely unused, as this policy really does very little with user- or role-based access control, focusing on confining outward-facing services instead. This policy does have some support for confining users, but it is off by default, and all interactive user logins are unconfined. Under the strict or mls policies, though, user- and role-based access control are much more heavily used. Users are always confined under these policies, and even what the user can do is limited by placing the root user in the role. Note that the mls policy causes X to break, so you won't generally see it on workstations. Most SELinux systems you're likely to run across will only be using the targeted policy; it's unusual to find strict or mls in use, though you will see it in places that require the user- and role-based security (e.g. defense contractors). In those cases you'll also likely see that they've customized the users and roles in use. It's possible to write a complete SELinux policy from scratch, but since this is a lot of work, and carries its own set of nightmares (e.g. documentation or the lack thereof) you won't see it very often. Though if you want to see a demo of role-based access control, this example from IBM of a policy written from scratch serves well. (A complete answer would be even more theory, so I'll just leave you with this. Day-to-day, the SELinux User Guide is your friend, and for the really tough SELinux questions, the mailing list is also your friend.) 

You say you have an "instance", which most likely means you're running RHEL on a cloud provider such as Amazon AWS or Google Cloud Platform. In this case, in addition to opening the firewall port within the instance, you also need to open the port in the external firewall provided by the cloud platform, such as an Amazon EC2 security group or Google cloud firewall. 

The problem is that you've put the tilde inside double quotes. When you do this, it is not expanded to the path of your home directory. Consider: 

You should already be using WordPress Multisite with the domain mapping extension. If you were, this would already work out-of-the-box. (Though you need to add something to your script to set up the domain map for each new customer.) This also eliminates the need to use mod_userdir, which seems like an ugly hack... 

The text-based CentOS installer installs only the "minimal" installation set, about 214 packages the last time I counted. Or maybe it was 241. Anyway, a very small set that is identical to what you would get if you chose "minimal" in the GUI installer. The Installation Guide has this to say: 

You're nowhere near cause for concern. A typical RADIUS access server has a configurable timeout of several seconds (e.g. Brocade switches have a 3 second timeout, Cisco switches have a 5 second timeout, and they all allow you to change it). Just keep your network connections terrestrial (that is, not over satellite) and you're not likely to run into any issues. If you need to increase the timeout, your existing switches should allow you to do that. 

Most likely you have some old PHP packages hanging around from before you installed the remi repository. First, make sure everything is up to date: 

PHP is well known to be rather CPU intensive. You've used all of the available CPU and nearly all of the available RAM. You should first take steps to deal with that, such as opcode caching (e.g. Zend OPcache) and file caching (e.g. W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin). If those don't help enough, then it's time to upgrade the instance. 

You can verify that OpenSSL uses Intel AES-NI by running OpenSSL's internal benchmarks. Compare the output of with . The former skips hardware acceleration even if present, while the latter uses acceleration if available. Except for the benchmark, it will be used automatically if present. For example: 

They're 13 highly available clusters of servers, not simply 13 servers. Among other things, root nameserver operators are required to have enough capacity to handle three times their normal traffic load (RFC 2870). This leads to rather large clusters. However, the root nameservers only serve responses for the top level domains themselves, i.e. , , , , etc., and the nameservers which query the root can cache this information up to 48 hours, which dramatically reduces the load at the root nameservers. This leads to smaller clusters. The root nameservers are in over 130 physical locations in 53 countries; with only 13 server names, this is done through the magic of IPv4 anycast. The root nameservers also have their own web site, which you may find interesting reading. 

Single quote the whole parameter (don't double quote it because is treated specially in double quoted items): 

If the sender is in your domain, it's outbound. If the recipient is in your domain, it's inbound. If neither are in your domain, it's relay, and drop it like a hot potato. 

You should no longer need to run any command to detect new devices; they should be detected and configured automatically when you connect them. If you have a device that isn't, then you should investigate that specifically. 

MySQL clients which link against libmysqlclient read global options from the section of . This is a typical behavior for such clients, and ProFTPD is such a client when you use its MySQL module. The SELinux boolean will allow this access, but it also effectively disables SELinux for the entire FTP daemon's operations, so it should not be used without extreme caution. If it were me, I would file a feature request against requesting that a boolean to allow this access be added, or perhaps to add it to the boolean. 

I'm assuming you've placed a file you want to include on the same DVD or USB media from which you are trying to install RHEL. The key here is that the installation media is not mounted at when you boot into it. Rather, is mounted from the read-only filesystem image on the installation media. The DVD/USB media itself gets mounted at in RHEL 7. So if you placed a file in the top level directory of the installation media, you will find it at . 

This will give you the transaction ID, which you can then look up and find the dependencies which were installed, e.g. with . 

You can match a rule for deletion by specifying it precisely and using () instead of . For instance: 

You may see a number of power-on hours on a new drive. It is normal for drive manufacturers to test their drives prior to shipping. For instance, WD RE drives are burn-in tested: 

It sounds like you have somehow created a password policy with a minimum password life longer than the maximum password life. Remember that the maximum is specified in days while the minimum is specified in hours. If you mix these up, then it's easy to do this. To confirm it, check the existing password policy: 

Your domain doesn't have an MX record to specify where mail should be delivered. When this happens, the address record (AAAA or A) will be tried instead, but your domain name doesn't have those either. Or, the domain has an MX record but the host named in the MX record label does not have address records. To resolve the problem, create an appropriate MX record. 

Courier imapd tries to do reverse DNS and ident lookups by default. Make sure you disable these, as one or the other (or both) is the most likely cause (and doing reverse DNS lookups at connection time leads to bad security). For instance: 

First you need to install the correct package. Download it and use to install it over the wrong package. Second, you need to clean the cached yum metadata that it had. Use to get rid of everything. Third, use to downgrade any packages that were installed for the wrong distribution. (And note that this will also upgrade any out-of-date packages.) 

The error message from told you why it didn't work, but for some reason you didn't act on that information. You should do what it suggested and stop the ntp server first, then try it again. 

The first of these accepts all local traffic, on the interface, regardless of its IP address. The second one accepts all traffic from 127.0.0.1, regardless of what interface it arrives on. In this case the first one is clearly better. In the first case, local traffic doesn't necessarily use 127.0.0.1 as its IP address but you probably want to accept it, (the best known of these is Debian's odd 127.0.1.1, but it's possible for global IP addresses to be attached to ) and in the second case, someone could send you spoofed packets with 127.0.0.1 as its source address and you probably don't want to accept that. Second: 

It's clear that even 40 is too many Apache processes. You have only 1GB RAM and 2GB swap, and you're using all the RAM and more than half of the swap. The reason your processes are in D status is because your virtual machine is thrashing in and out of swap. It's unlikely to recover on its own; you may as well reboot it. Decrease the number significantly. For a low traffic site on a micro instance, I can't imagine any way you would need it to be higher than 10 (nor for the instance to be able to handle much more). In fact, the settings you have commented out look like a very good starting point, and you should probably restore them. Once you've recovered, you can start looking at what else on the system might be eating up lots of RAM. 

It might be easiest if you just make a new kickstart file. Do the installation manually from the USB stick. The installed system will have a generated which you can then add your own customizations to. Customize and copy that kickstart file back to the USB stick and then run it. 

Fedora 21 and RHEL/CentOS 7 use the new Python-based postgrey reimplementation. In this implementation the only change you need in your Postfix configuration is to call the service from . For instance, taken from my own mail server: 

At the end of our rules, we reject all traffic that didn't match a rule, using "port unreachable". This results in the standard "Connection refused" message at the other end, and effectively hides the fact that we have a firewall. Tools such as nmap will report that all our ports are "closed" rather than "filtered" and have a much more difficult time determining that we even have a firewall. 

The displayed uptime is that of the host. The kernel does not track uptime for individual containers in this way (though Docker does). 

You already removed Plesk, so just reinstall it. And, in future, be careful with . Inspect what it says it's doing very carefully before you approve it. 

The way to handle this is to collect all the information about what access the program needs, and then explicitly allow only that access in a custom policy module. This is fairly easy to do. First, you set the domain permissive, so that SELinux temporarily does not enforce its rules. It will still log the denials, and later you will use these logs.
