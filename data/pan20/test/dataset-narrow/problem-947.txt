If I had to do this, I would do it via option 2 - but I have experience in excel and scripting. I guess you need to weigh up the time involved trying to do it manually vs the time it will take you to work out custom formatting and potentially H or V Lookup in excel. 

To create 3D PDF's you need a PDF Printer which supports this, I haven't seen a free piece of software to do this, but there may be one. Try these - 

You do not need to change the MBR, if you have two physical hard disks, change their Boot Order in the BIOS so that the Grub Disk boots first. 

You have several options to achieve this, It's hard to say which is best without more information - here's two options... 

I have this disk partition layout - with 2 working W10 OS's. One on the 40GB partition and one on the 400GB partition. I want to use the additional 34GB in the OS on the 40GB partition. I dont mind reinstalling the OS on the 40GB disk, but want to keep the 400GB W10 OS intact. Is this possible somehow? 

I want to view the USB bandwidth usage of different devices on my Windows 10 laptop (1607). I found this article from Microsoft which advises to check in Device Manager, however the Advanced tab doesn't exist when I look at the properties of my USB Host Controller. The controller name is "Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)" so I thought I might need a less generic driver from Intel. But when I check the Intel site I can only find USB 3.0 drivers for Windows 7 and below. Is there a way on Windows 10 to view the USB bandwidth usage of individual devices? 

I can't say 100% yes or no, but there are some things you may be able to investigate to increase your confidence either way.... What is the maximum output resolution on the mini-display port. Graphics cards have seperate 'heads'. If the maximum display resolution on the head is 2x the monitor resolutions you are using, you can probably use a splitter. If not, probably not. 

Note that I had to use my own addresses as I'm configured for a different subnet etc, and I don't have DNS Keys setup so am unable to test that. A couple of things to check; What have you got set in You should have a line like this; so that your box asks its self for NS lookups I suspect your machine is configured to use another DNS server. What's the IP address of you box - you had an error in your original question with having a reverse address of and a forward of 

It sounds like you need to provide your proxy details to so that you can connect; In you should add the following lines (updated with your valid proxy & login details). 

Yes - but you will need to restart ntpd to reload the config. Have a look at the docs here. You can set two options and which you can adjust to give you the desired upper and lower limits. 

It sounds like your repo data has gone stale, corrupt, or something has changed since you last updated. Please try and then try again and see if that has resolved your issue. If it's still not working check the file which you should find located at you should expect to see something like this (extracted from my file) 

The short answer is 'no' the UPS you provided the link too has a built in NIC and USB port for management and controlling server shutdown etc. You can connect the UPS to your existing network or connect directly to your server via USB (Provided you can get the software for your OS). Check the APC documentation and that should tell you the default IP so you can configure the UPS. You don't say what you want to 'manage' but once the UPS is on the network you will be able to setup SNMP, email alerts and get access to the web portal of system settings (Voltage adjust, low battery warning time etc.) With regards to having it shut down a server you have a couple of choices so should look at the software options on the APC site here. 

This has been a problem for me for too long, and I have no idea how to resolve. I use a Dell Laptop with a docking station, the 14" Touch Screen has a greater than HD resolution. This means that when using the laptop screen, I have the displayed scaled to 125%. Generally this works well, and when my laptop is docked and connected to my two desk screens (1920x1080) I have the display scaled at 100%. The problem is that randomly some desktop components do not respect the DPI scaling settings. e.g. PowerBI (a Microsoft application!) was working fine for me yesterday while docked. Now today some of the text is wrong, see screenshot. Notice how the popup autocomplete window text is too big, and therefore cutoff. What confuse me is that this was fine yesterday. This issue seems to happen in Visual Studio and other Microsoft products more often than other applications, which is extra frustrating because I'm running their OS (W10 v1511) and their software and it doesnt work!! Any suggestions? 

I have a lab setup on Hyper-V 2016. It was a few servers and two Domain Controllers. I had some issues with the host and noticed that my vm's rebooted randomly with a message unable to connect to VM Storage. The storage was a storage group with 2 1TB HDD's and 4 256 SSD's. I assumed that the Disk IO was just too much and caused the issue so to remove some of the IO load, i removed all the snapshots. (Big Mistake!) I connect to the lab today and both domain controllers are unbootable, looks like they ungracefully shutdown during a windows update - the bit preboot. Tried a couple of reboots, a fix about deleting pending.xml but can't get either of them to boot. Is there anyway to recover a domain controller with no backup, just with access to the hard disk? 

It could be that the graphics card does not support analogue output. With DVI you can have an analog or a digital signal. With analogue a basic adaptor can convert DVI -> VGA, but if the signal is digital you need an 'active' adaptor. Active adaptors have to convert Digital to Analog so require additional power and are more expensive. I think you may need an active DVI -> VGA adaptor. 

It looks like your yum is broken... - Can you check your config file is actually at and its contents is valid. You could try and re-install from here. You may need to find your own deps. 

If you are on a linux client with ntp installed & configured to point at the Windows DC you can do; which will return all the info. If you need help to understand it please post it here and we can help. or which will do a 1 time query of the time/date but NOT set the client. 

For example in my config I list; which polls my gps pps every 16sec. & cal be used together. I don't believe there is any way to reduce the poll frequency 'now' and have it work back up to 1024 but you can reduce it and keep it within a more desired window. 

Where is the package name you want. Having seen your comment the direct download can be found here One other thing to check - (Or whatever your version is called) and check to see if you have the following lines and what's enabled. 

This answer presumes you have access to the admin page on the DIR-655 and physical access to the device cabling. Presuming all of these devices share a common IP subnet (Address range) then you should be able to do the following; 

You have a couple of errors in your zone config. The biggest one is the incorrect IP address A valid IP only allows up to 255. I have built your zone into one of my test servers and it loads once the errors have been fixed (I changed the IP to become .8 (as per your rev-zone). There was a clue in the log output you got when trying to start named. Here is a working zone file tested on bind-9.8; 

Firstly ntpdate is depreciated so you shouldn't use that in a production environment now. You should configure and run the ntp daemon correctly configured instead for a reliable timing setup and removing the chances that you will jump the server time (as ntp will continually adjust the clock as required) As you have seen the problem with just using the pool is that you may get any server it decides based on the dns query, in your situation you should pick 3 - 5 low stratum servers directly and add those to your config on both machines. ntp likes to have a minimum of 3 servers and ideally 5 to sync from to ensure a robust time domain. If you pick some low stratum servers they should all be within a few ms of each other (if not better) and provided they are configured correctly you shouldn't need to worry. If your requirements grow and you need to sync more machines then you could run your own server to ensure that what you serve internally only ever comes from 1 reference source at a time. 

You need to add the data you have to the data model in excel. Then you can pivot it and do a SUM on the hours. Depending on your version of Excel, you may need to install PowerPivot add in. 

Sharing folders via Windows is called SMB or CIFS. However I doubt if you have a home network with one machine on 192.168.2.1 and another on 192.168.1.1 that it would work as they would probably be on different subnets depending on your network config. 

Use a table in word, fill in the left most column with the question numbers manually then add "a" to "x" in the other cells. Manually set the background colour to black and the text colour to white on the cells you require. If you already have a list of question numbers and the correct answer (a,b,c etc...) then do it in excel using conditional formatting to highlight the correct answer. Then just copy and paste into word. 

I don't think its a problem Mouse / Keyboard as they are both quite standard devices, which work fine through a Hub connected to any machine and also through the KVM Switch whilst connected to Computer 1. Any help or advice people might have is very welcome - over the years I have had many problems with different KVM's and can never understand why, when simple unpowered USB hubs work fine. 

I don't understand how / why this will not work, I have a un-powered USB hub which works with all three computers and the two peripherals connected. The keyboard is a DELL KB212-B and Mouse is a classic Microsoft White 5 Button Optical USB InteliMouse. The USB portion of a KVM should be a hub and the parent USB connection gets disconnected and reconnected to the other parent USB port when the switch is pressed? The StarTech manual says to change the following BIOS options, which do not exist in a DELL BIOS :
