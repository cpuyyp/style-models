The two host acan ping each other because they are on the same subnet, /16 can contains host located on /24, that is the reason. 

This ACL is defined to vlan 4, allowing access to internet and to vlan 1. MUST be applied INBOUND on respective vlan 4 subinterface on router. You need to create 2 mores to vlan 2 and 3, and do the same thing 

There is a LOOP between the SG200-26(server room) and SG200-26(office1) switches, i think your probarly need to implement some etherchannel to use the 2 links like one and get more bandwith. Once you do that, convert it into a trunk port and allow vlan 2 and 3, that´s it, its simple. By other hand, if you read your logs, you ccan see mac-address flapping between the 2 switches, and with that, topology changes. If you troubleshoot spanning-tree you can see that one of the 2 ports on one on the switches is in DISCARDING state, that is the reason why you can´t communicate on that VLAN 

You need to clear your conf, and see between your gateways and static routes. Firts: chimay can ping orval and westmalle because it is directly connected, but, once the request arrives from HOST to chimay, then it is sended to orval and westmalle(you can see it on a sniffer), but the thing is that orval and westmalle do not know where is located HOST(IP 192.168.122.1). I think you need to add an static route on orval like this 

You need to set a gateway to all the PC!!!!! When you configure the addressing of all pc, you must set, IP address, Mask and Gateway. Gateway is the only way that your network can communicate with other network, in this case, the address that you set on the router interface connected on the same switch. In this case, E0(router) should be configured with an IP of your network, and that IP must me configured as gateway in all your PCs. 

So, the longer answer to your question is that you're "not supposed" to do it that way. You should have all that overhead configuration in your network monitoring system. Routers are not very good databases. For example, if you upgrade your transit connection data rate you might change the CID. Does that mean you need to change the description on the BGP peer? 

And this would run 'generic-policy' in the middle of the 'test' route-policy. However, it looks like XE uses route-maps and not route-policies, so unfortunately that capability isn't available to you. route-maps in XE appear to be discrete objects and you can't chain them in that way. 

There are some platforms like my "favorite" 6500 which can have strong negative reactions to some types or amounts of traffic that is just fine being completely switched through the router becomes a different story once you create a SVI. typically this would be non-ip traffic, but its very hard to predict. 

I know the API guide linked is the 4.1 version, but I can't find the 4.2 version of the same document. Also, the XML tty agent (i.e., typing 'XML' at the # prompt) does work as expected. 

There are several interface counters that don't work as well as they used to. Sometimes this is because the chassis/router has a 'fast' switching mode (CEF, or something else), and that particular 'bucket' never gets hit. Another reason might be that that particular counter only works in L3 mode instead of L2 mode. This kind of stuff is quite common, unfortunately on cisco products, particularly on the 6500 which has an enormous amount of legacy code/architecture weighing it down. 

There are some odd corner cases you can do with wild card masks that are difficult to do with subnet masks - for example, you could do 1.2.*.4 easily in a wild card mask that would be hard to do in a subnet mask. How practical this is is left up to the operator in question. Basically a wild card mask splits up each bit into a 'match' or 'don't care' setting. if you have 255.255.255.33. for example, that would translate to '11111111.11111111.11111111.00100001'. If the original IP was 1.1.1.200, this translates to 00000001.00000001.00000001.10001000. Using the example given, which is starting to make my brain hurt from doing binary math, only the 3 and 8th bit of the last octet would have to match the original IP in order to be a pass (along with the other 3 octets). 

Buddy, Wireshark only shows capture traffic in a readable way for the user, this is the only function, read, decrypt, follow networks streams, and so on. What you want to do is configure some kind of mirror of all your pcs to yours. I guess, you need to read the documentation of your switch, and it mirror capabilities. By the other hand, there is one kind of wireshark configuration that gives you what you want, but you need to install wireshark on every pc, and activate the remote capture on it. 

Explaination about the Data link layer is frequently related with a software as a driver for a network interface card (NIC). The data link and physical layers are so closely one to the other, because many types of hardware are also associated with the data link layer. Ex: NICs typically implement a specific data link layer technology, so they are often called Ethernet cards, Token Ring cards, etc. Then Enpoints on physical and data link layer, is to hard to differetiate, cause the pyshical layer is the medium, electrical or optical signal that travel on some form, to reach some device(where most often, is decoded the signal(link-layer) and the information is passed up to the upper layers. An application endpoint is the commom application that perform the action, the data request or transmit, ex: an Explorer, FTP_client and so on 

You need to communicate with your provider, on the way to see if it's presenting some troubles on his side, checking from the physical link, eg, fiber troubles, some equipment, or something else. On the way to debug your BGP session, you need to change what do you want to see, like is explained here: $URL$ 

Note: x can be a gateway provide by your isp (usually you entablish a link using an /30 network, or can be the interface connected to you ISP, this one depends of your configuration) 

If you use linux or windows, you can test with Iperf, and server-client application that easily can do what you want. You can get information here: 

...and promptly get hacked, but your attacker will end up in user mode. So if you have an enable password set, at least you have somewhat limited the damage that can be done. (Technically, you can't go any further without an enable password either. More on that in a moment...) Naturally, no one would do this in real life. Your minimum requirement, by default and by common sense, is to set a simple password: 

In this scenario, there's no need to use an enable password (or secret.) If you're not yet thinking, "wow... what a clusterfudge that was", bear in mind there's a whole other long-winded post still lurking behind the command , where you get to dive into things like external authentication servers (RADIUS, TACACS+, LDAP, etc.), authentication lists (which define the sources to use, and in which order), authorization levels, and user activity accounting. Save all that for a time when you feel like getting locked out of your router for a while. Hope that helps! 

This is one of those things that tightens the sphincter of the security-conscious. Whether it's justified anxiety is again something you have to decide for yourself. On one hand, if you have sufficient access to see the configuration, you probably have sufficient access to change the configuration. On the other hand, if you happen to have carelessly revealed your configuration to someone who doesn't have the means themselves, then ... well, now they do have the means. Luckily, that first line in the snippet above, , is the key to changing that: 

Now, you will be asked for a password, and you will again end up in user mode. If you're coming in via the console, you can just type to get access without having to enter another password. But things are different via telnet, where you will probably get this instead: 

This is marginally better than plain-text passwords, because the displayed string isn't memorable enough to shoulder-surf. However, it's trivial to decrypt -- and I use that term loosely here. You can literally paste that string above into one of a dozen JavaScript password crackers on the first Google results page, and get the original text back immediately. These so-called "7" passwords are commonly considered "obfuscated" rather than "encrypted" to highlight the fact that it is just barely better than nothing. As it turns out, however, all those commands are deprecated. (Or if they're not, they should be.) That's why you have the following two options: 

To give to you a correct answer, you need to exposed wich kind of network equipment do you have, ex: switches, routers. Router is the expensive way, you only need to configure the PLC in one network, and all your other equipment in the other network. The router will be on charge to forward all the traffic between the 2 equipments with it respective ip address. With switches, you must configure every one of the equipment in different vlans, with it respective address, PLC in a 192.168.x.x range, and the other in 10.10.x.x range. The you must set the gateway of the PLC pointing to the vlan if of that network on the switch, and do the same with the other network to reach the PLC. On this way, you would be able to communicate between then Another solution: On a router, also you can NAT the PLC address to an address in your network 

iBGP is for internal use on an AS, is entablished between routers on the same AS. By other hand, eBGP is between routers on different AS, is on the way that internet works. On your question, you said that why routers on the same AS some time need to learn routes learned by BG, i guess, because BGP works with the major posibilities of some routing protocols, it can be used to control the way that traffic flow on your AS: maybe you are a transit AS connected to different ISP, Providers an so on, then you can control the path that traffic get to reach some networks, and with that, saving money(maybe your L2 providers have different prices), providing the less congested link to some ISP, use the fastest link to leave your AS, and some other scenarios. 

You can get the mac address of the device that you want to isolate, and put it on your router, blocking or filtering the access to the admin console. That is a basic security function on networks devices. 

If you turn on inbound soft-reconfiguration on the neighbor in question, then you will see another entry in the list with the pre-policy communities on it. 

Your routers on the f0/0 network are not in the same subnet. Router 2 should be 172.16.2.2 255.255.255.0 They can only communicate with each other if they have a shared subnet. I'm also assuming that the ethernet network is the one you're using to connect them. 

In IOS-XR, there are different concepts of authorization than in classic IOS. In classic IOS, there's only command authorization, which allows or denies specific commands, typically sent to a tacacs+ or radius server. In IOS-XR, there is command authorization (aaa authorization commands) (but you're better off doing this via task-groups) and exec authorization(aaa authorization exec) , which controls who can actually start an exec session. It appears that using the normal access method (ssh/telnet to the vtys) that if you're authenticated, no other authorization is necessary, but if you start the XML agent on its own dedicated port, then that use must be authorized. In my particular case, we are using a TACACS server for authentication, and I was specifying to use local authorization. The username does not exist on the router, so using the local method 'aaa authorization exec default local' caused authorization to fail. Changing it to 'aaa authorization exec group tacacs+ local' caused it to get the 'authorization OK' from the TACACS servers, and all is well. 

So if I put in a fake password, it knows that it's the wrong one, and doesn't go any further, but when I put in my real password it looks like I'm missing some kind of link-up between the authorization engine and the XML engine. If I take out the aaa authorizaion exec default local, I get a slightly different error: 

Unfortunately on IOS the show advertised command has always showed the attributes of the route pre policy. It will drop routes that were denied but the attributes are the original ones. Instead I recommend setting up a bgp session to another one of your devices, turning on soft reconfig inbound and denying all routes. This will let you look at the attributes of the sent routes. You could also try a debug, but that might be a lot to go through.
