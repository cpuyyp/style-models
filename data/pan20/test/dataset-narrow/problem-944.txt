I've had to deal with some issues like this on a clients workstation before. We needed a utility called CleanWipe which is only legitimately obtained from their support after opening a ticket (It might have changed). I found the following link which explains a little more about the CleanWipe tool and obtaining it $URL$ 

Yep, its just like chrisF said, Here is a KB article from microsoft explaining it as well and Here is a KB article explaining what a DLL is. Think of them as library files for programs on your computer. They hold instructions on how to do different things for different programs. When you register it you are telling your computer that you have these instructions, where there at and programs that say they need them can use them now. 

With X and Y being two different values, Acceleration and Threshold I believe. These settings change after a reboot so you would have to add them into a startup script. A quick search says that this command will give you your current value on ubuntu, but im not in a location I can try it right now. 

Well if you are just looking for a cheap way to add an extra monitor and you can not or do not want to purchase a new video card you can always look at some of these USB video cards. The drivers for most that I have seen are only for windows systems and the cards will not be as powerful, but if you are looking for a cheap easy way to add an extra monitor, it is another option besides adding another internal video card. 

First thing that I would do is to go to the computer that it does not work on, run each command from cmd.exe one after another and see which step does not complete its task like it should. Once we can narrow it down to which step is having problems it might be easier to find out what is going wrong on that machine. If everything works fine when you manually run each command then I would guess that one of the variables is not setting itself correctly on the other machine. 

First, I would try to get access to chkdsk.exe if possible and run that on the drive just incase there is a problem with the filesystem and linux is just being much more picky about it. It seems that fat32 has a backup boot sector at sector 6. You could always try to replace sector 0 with that sector and see if it helps you out, but I would probably try the chkdsk route and see if that helps you out at all. 

I am running a headless Linux Ubuntu 10.0.4 on my server. I only allow access to the server using ssh (and scp). I have a dev machine situated at home (behind a firewall) and I am able to copy files from my local (dev) machine to the server using scp. However, I now want to transfer files the other way, i.e. from the server to my dev machine. Anyone knows the best way to do this?. BTW, I am running same OS on my dev machine (Ubuntu 10.0.4) 

What is the meaning of this messade? Why have the mounts failed? (most important) what are the steps required to I recover from this disaster? 

I am new to bash scripting (not programming in general). I am writing a bash script that will run a Python script I have written. I want to be able to do the following: 

Update I followed Giles advice. I setup my my PC to bootup from the USB disk if all else fails. This time, I get the following message (shortened here, as I am typing it out) 

At this stage, I am not sure if my USB stick is bootable or not (dosen't look like it is). I am thinking of installing a barand new OS on the stick, and starting from there - BUT, I don't know what the consequences of that will be (will I lose my existing data on my machine?). Help! 

I am running Ubuntu 10.x on one of my boxes. Yesterday the SPM popped up during a session, with the choice to install the latest updates. I agreed (like I have done many times before). This time, during the installation, the system crashed, the SPM reported that a Python exception had occured during the installation (unfortunately, I don't remember on which stage of the installation the exception occured). I rebooted the system, since I could not get rid of the SPM dialog box which was displayed greyed out and was unresponsive. When I attempted to login again (after the reboot), I was met with a console screen with the following message (after a stack trace): 

I run a script which generated about 10k files in a directory. I just discovered that there is a bug in the script which causes some filenames to have a carriage return (presumably a '\n' character). I want to run a sed command to remove the carriage return from the filenames. Anyone knows which params to pass to sed to clean up the filenames in the manner described? I am running on Linux (Ubuntu) UPDATE The character causing the filename to 'break up' accross multiple lines appear to be a CR (carriage return) instead of '\n'. The filename is being diaplayed in thetitle of a text editor with %0D in the positions of where the file name breaks up. So I need to remove the CR chars from my filenames. 

I'm guessing it's not related to ICMP being blocked. If that was the case, the response would simply timeout, not result in a "no route to host" message. "No route to host" means exactly that: when the destination of the ICMP message is not on the local subnet, it will be forwarded to the machine's default gateway for it to handle. If there is no default gateway, or the gateway has no information in its routing table to forward the packets, you'll see "no route to host." Both your ping and traceroute commands are resolving the domain name to an IP address (albeit different addresses), so it appears that the DNS resolution is probably working okay. So I'd double check that your default gateways are the same/properly configured on the iMac first. Also, from what I've seen, OS X seems to favor WiFi to a wired connection when both are connected. Check that you only have one connected (if you happen to be using both) and see if it works. 

Try disconnecting all wireless devices and then connecting them one at a time, checking that speed readout after each new device is connected. I'm not 100% sure about the N standard, but with some of the older standards, one device could slow down the rates for all devices (ie. when a B device connects to a G network, the G network slows to B speeds). Perhaps something similar is happening here. 

Windows can do some interesting things with sleep. I believe it can be configured to wake and then go into hibernate mode (which would avoid giving you errors from an unexpected shutdown). It doesn't look like your machine is configured that way (I'd expect to see "sleep after" x minutes, and then "hibernate after" x minutes, or perhaps "Critical battery action" as "hibernate"). My guess (although the corresponding option in your power settings output you includes is missing for some reason) is that your machine has "hybrid sleep" enabled, which saves the contents of RAM to your hard drive at sleep time and then sleeps as normal. If a power loss occurs, then the contents of RAM are restored from the hard drive, just as if you had originally hibernated instead of put the machine to sleep. From Microsoft: "Hybrid sleep is designed primarily for desktop computers. Hybrid sleep is a combination of sleep and hibernateâ€”it puts any open documents and programs in memory and on your hard disk, and then puts your computer into a low-power state so that you can quickly resume your work. That way, if a power failure occurs, Windows can restore your work from your hard disk. When hybrid sleep is turned on, putting your computer into sleep automatically puts your computer into hybrid sleep. Hybrid sleep is typically turned on by default on desktop computers." source: $URL$ Perhaps that option is missing because this feature is primarily for desktops, or because the manufacturer (if you haven't clean installed Windows after purchasing the machine) has somehow removed it from that list. It could still be enabled, but not customizable for you.
