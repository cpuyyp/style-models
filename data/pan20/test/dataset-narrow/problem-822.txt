Apologies for such a simple question, but I've been searching for how to download the UE-V 2.x client files for the last few days and all I can find is references on how to install them, nothing on where they are located to begin with. I must be missing something basic, for anyone who has setup EU-V before can you fill me in on what I'm missing? 

Apologies for the wasted time, I didn't realise at the time but when I restored the database to the second server I didn't select restore with NO RECOVERY. After making the change and attempting to mirror again the process worked. I still don't understand why I was receiving an error indicating the cluster was not responding considering the problem was on the stand-alone mirrored server. 

I've got a MS SQL 2008 R2 Fail-Over Clustered Instance running between two Windows 2008 R2 servers using the inbuilt Windows Clustering features, that is working with a DTC and Quorum with a disk based Witness. This has been working fine for months and little concerns with the functionality. I've now been asked to add DB Mirroring to an alternate site (asynchronously) but when setting up the Mirroring partners the Endpoint on the cluster fails to respond. Pinging the Cluster Name returns the clusters IP so I'm not sure how to confirm its routing to the active host. Firewall port has been opened on both the remote server and the two clustered servers. Can anyone direct me on the steps you need to take to do Asynchronous database mirroring on a W2008R2/MSSQL2008R2 Fail-Over Cluster in order to make the Endpoint on the cluster reachable by the mirror? 

I followed a link for a beta version of the client and found that it was included in Microsoft Desktop Optimisation Pack. Apologies for wasting your time... and mine 

I'm trying to deploy a custom background into %windir%\system32\oobe\info\background\backgroundDefault.jpg and have created bat, ps1 files in both Applications and Packages to try and deliver the file, however when run through CM the file and folders are not created and success is reported. Even if the background folder doesn't exist the Detection Method still states it exists. For the Application method of deployment I tried a File System path detection on File and on Folder. I also tried a custom powershell script for detection. In both cases installation was recorded successful but the files weren't transferred. Package based installation did the same thing, completed with no errors. I'm pretty confused and search engines aren't helping. When I run the scripts manually with admin access the process works. But SCCM running as System (not in user Context) it repeats the same answer. Has anyone seen this? I'm stumped. Here is the basic bat and ps1 scripts, the custom detection method was just a PowerShell Test-Path command on the end file. bat 

I have created 2 EC2 instances in AWS. One acts as DB Server and one acts as client. Oracle 12c DB instance is installed on DB server and Oracle 12c instant client on client server. I have created a schema, added some tables and data in it and then I exported the DB dump and the log. I am able to connect to Oracle server via sys user from Oracle Client server. I have transferred the exported DB dump (using expdp command) and logs to client server. I am trying to import the exported DB dump from the client server using impdp command. 

Here the important line is cmdline Now we can run the below command to install the KVM guest. This command can be run on a Physical server. 

I have installed the required packages for KVM virtualization on my server. Now I am trying to install a KVM guest. But I am not able to install it. Below is the command which I have tried to do. 

But still I am not able to run the expect command as a normal user. I have some scripts which needs to be run as normal user with expect statements. I have done all possible ways which I can think of. Please help!! 

In virtual box, we may encounter timeout & dracut error. You just need to enter exit in the dracut shell. So that the installation will continue. 

Since I am using the LXC containers, all the processes of the VM's are are originated from the Host server. So number of process on the host server was very large if we exclude the root user. Initially thought that it may be because of Java Heap space issue and i tried to increase the heap space to a larger value. But the issue was repeating. I resolved the issue by increasing the number of process for user in Host server 

I am thinking that there has to be a way in mailx command which allows the mail to be send with html format or atleast the tab spaced output as seen in the linux. if this doesn't work by anyways then I need to get the sendmail working. 

I have an LXC container with CentOS 7.4 running. On running expect from Normal user I am getting the below error. 

The output of mount also have these in mount point. devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,relatime,seclabel,mode=620,ptmxmode=000) I have ran the below updates in the server. 

After quite a bit of searching, I found that I needed to create the /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts structures inside the chroot. 

I've built a test lab running Windows Server 2016 and SCCM 2016 and I'm having an issue with PXE booting a VM to install an OS via SCCM. Here's the run down on the configuration. At this stage SCCM isn't being touched Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 with Hyper-V Role installed Private Network Virtual Switch, no VLAN set, named "Local only" VM - DHCP - Gen2 VM - Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 with DHCP Role installed, Network Adapter - On vSwitch "Local Only" VM - Win10BC - Gen2 VM - No OS (PXE UEFI), Network Adapter - On vSwitch "Local Only" For both VMs NIC Hardware Acceleration Tab has Enable Virtual Machine Queue ticked, Enable IPsec task offloading ticked with Maximum number: 1 For both VMs NIC Advanced Features Tab has Protected Network ticked DHCP Server has a single domain authorised IPv4 Scope bound to Eth0 192.168.0.5, NICs from full OS VMs in the same configuration can get a DHCP Lease Win10BC VM attempts to PXE Boot - "PXE Network Boot using IPv4 ( ESC to cancel), Performing DHCP Negotiation........" Using Wireshark on DHCP Server I can see DHCP Discover from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, DHCP Server Responds 192.168.0.5 to 255.255.255.255 with DHCP Offer. After a short delay the DHCP Discover and Offer process occurs again and there is no DHCP Request or Acknowledge step returned to the DHCP Server. It ends up timing out and Virtual Machine Boot Summary, 1. Network Adapter DHCP Failed This is where I'm stuck, either the DHCP Offer Broadcast isn't reaching the PXE VM or it's receiving and not responding to the DHCP Server. I've tried adding a vLAN to each member, I've tried turning off VMQ and IPsec task offloading, I've turned off Protected network with no change. On the DHCP Server I've ensured the DHCP firewall rules for IPv4 apply to Domain, Private and Public, Checked the NIC is correctly bound to respond and that other devices can get leases. All of this is on a single Hyper-V host with the DHCP Server and PXE Guest on the same vSwitch. I realise this is Technical Preview software but I'm hoping there is a solution and this isn't a bug in the preview software. Has anyone experienced this before? On 2016, 2012? I can provide screenshots of configuration as required. 

I'm implementing security restrictions for a client who would like to prevent admin accounts from logging into workstations. For example each person has a user account and an admin account and only the user account should have access. The admin account is for troubleshooting purposes and for escalating privileges to resolve issues. If I deny Interactive Log-on for the admin accounts, then the ability to use them for Run As is also removed. I also looked at "Allow Log on locally" and specifying only normal accounts but that means removing Administrators from Allow Log on locally which causes further issues. My current recourse is to make a logon script that looks to see if the user is a normal account or admin account and in the latter circumstance start a logout process. Can anyone think of a better way of doing this? We are simply trying to implement least privileged access and ensure the administrators don't login with their admin accounts. 

I have increased the nproc limit in my server to 2047. And I hope that resourse unavailable message will not come again But while entering the java command itself, it is throwing the error "Insufficent memory". I tried to set the java heap memory but that also not allowing. I am not sure how to proceed further. Please help!! OS is Centos 6.8 Java Version is Jdk 1.6 Virtualization is LXC multiple Virtual machines are running in host server. Free memory is 15GB across all virtual machines. 

But I am not getting how to mention local server (client server) path as directory. when ever i try adding a virtual directory it is saying path doesn't exists. This path /home/oracle/exportDB is in client server. Can you please give me suggestions as I am out of options. PS: I am doing this for a POC purpose in scenario where there is less space in DB server and cannot send the DB dump file to DB server because it is huge. And please do not down vote question. I have searched many forums and no where this is referenced. 

Thanks to the website $URL$ I have quoted the script and the details from the above site. After executing the script, I was able to execute the command 

I have a requirement to send the output of certain output as an email to myself. like etc. I have used mailx command with override of smtp host with command , I was able to receive the mail but the formatting was not correct and it came as a . It is not aligned and it is getting difficult to read the content. In all the forums/blogs, I saw that we will be able to send the html content inside mail using sendmail. But I wanted to try out by overriding the smtp host. But unable to do the same. Any help would be much appreciated. 

I have created a kickstart file and pointed the location. But I am not able to proceed further. I have seen options telling you need to have a vnc console and proceed. But I am looking for a text only automatic installation. I am trying to install this over ssh, so vnc or console is not an option for me. Any help is much appreciated. 

to a large value of 16000. And also I increased the number of process in each VM's to a higher value of 4096. Now both the issues of "Resource temporarily unavailable [fork] & insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue" are resolved. And everything is working fine now. 

I have one SCCM 2012 server not correctly responding to PXE requests for unknown computers. The server has PXE boot support enabled, enabled unknown computer support, boot images available with OS deployments available and targeted at unknown computers. However every time a computer comes through I receive the following error.

On all other errors I've looked at with people having problems with this step it shows further information about unable to find and then to return with abortpxe.com but mine isn't. ItemKey="2046820353" is "x64 Unknown Computer" in my SCCM at the Primary site for this Secondary site Deployment server. I've deleted all the "Unknown" computers, I've cleared pending PXE deployments and updated Memberships of all relevant computer groups but it still won't work. Does anyone have any idea on where I should look to resolve this problem or to dig deeper? Thanks 

Since I posted this I've come into the problem many times, and in nearly all of them it was Scope Options Having any of the following options set caused problems, 60, 66, 67. In the case of only 60 being set it still allowed connection to an SCCM PXE point outside of the subnet with IP Helpers enabled but failed at providing a boot image. In addition I've also seen incorrect vlan id's causing very similar issues. So in general if you get to the point that PXE starts, talks to CM but doesn't complete (and no error is reported), check your IP Helpers, your vLANs and your Scope options.
