I just looked at my copy of Winrar, and I do not think it is possible to make Winrar check for an OS and extract based on that (I had serious doubts even before I looked). You may be able to do it in a batch file on your own, or using some other program that makes installers. You would be interested in the or variables. Using those would direct it to the proper program files you wish to use. 

Adapters, while they can certainly go bad, are much more reliable than routers. You see questions here all the time where the routers have just gone bad. They also often fail intermittently rather than dropping dead. I have seen it happen with one computer, but not another, so see if you can test your desktop with another router. This could rule out the desktop as the problem. You can also update your network card driver. 

I always thought 255 total as in Breakthrough's answer but I found this to be contradictory as I started to double-check my thoughts: 

I will delete this after you look at it, but compare your settings to this default found in Tools>Options>Content>Fonts & Colors>Advanced: 

If you are the same user logged in and RDP'ing, it just does it. So if you are both using the same user, just set up two different ones, and it should work as you want. Otherwise, I am not sure how else to do it. 

I don't know if you like the new task bar, but I HATE it. I use the "Free Launch Bar". It gives you back the old task bar, including a quick-launch equivalent. After you install it, you enable it by right-clicking the taskbar>Toolbar>click Free Launch Bar. It is awesome, imo. $URL$ 

Leave the username blank, and the password is admin. If you set that, it will hold it automatically, unless you use the reset button to set it back to the factory defaults (not something you can do by accident since you have to hold the button in for 5 seconds). $URL$ 

Try disabling your anti-virus while running it. Also, are you running it with administrative privileges. 

I would not use the Microsoft Disk Management tool. I am not a fan of Microsoft's Dynamic disks. I would use a 3rd party tool. I personally have a number of them dating back a long time, including Partition Magic and Acronis Disk Director. A very popular and easy-to-use option is the home edition of Easeus: $URL$ . $URL$ 

Just open Devices and Printers, Right-click the printer, and click "Create shortcut". It will put the shortcut on your desktop and you can then move it wherever you want. You can see the one I created, and opened by clicking the shortcut to the right in this screenshot: 

The point of -L is to find all the servers on the entire network, so you cannot bypass it scanning the entire network, and that switch will not work with other switches. The timeout is really related specifically to your network, and its configuration. Are you just trying to find the instance names? What specifically are you trying to accomplish? 

If you are trying to send from a home-class Internet service using a DHCP IP address, the entire subnet has been listed as DHCP by your ISP (they are required to do this), and that has been picked up by the blacklists. If you have a DHCP IP address, another major issue is that your PTR DNS record (used to make sure that you are who you say you are, and not a spammer, who is relaying) does not refer back to your mail server, but to your ISP's DNS host name they have given your IP address. That problem will also get your mail blackholed at Hotmail and AOL, among others. In that case, your only option is a "smarthost", which is a relay that you send your mail through, and it delivers it on your behalf. These are not blacklisted and are configured with a proper PTR record, so the mail goes fine. Your ISP may have an SMTP server smarthost that you can relay though, but unless you have a business account (I actually have a business-class Internet package that I use with DHCP and DDNS, so I relay through their business-class SMTP relay smarthost), SMTP servers for home-class Internet packages have all but gone away. If that is the case, you Google "smtp relay service" (minus the quotes), and find one that you can pay for. They are typically $20-$50 per year. I have been doing IT professionally for 17 years, but e-mail is my specialty. 

The single biggest reason for Pro is to join a Windows domain (not that home users don't want other features). Other than that, based on these forums, the next biggest would be to be able to RDP into the computer. A couple of lesser, but important, reasons would be language packs and bitlocker encryption. Personally, I hate how they eliminate some troubleshooting and management functionality, like not having group policy editors. 

Simply put, you do not have enough memory to really run Windows XP well. Your are probably doing a lot of memory swapping to the hard drive, causing you slowness. New service packs, and a lot of (necessary security) updates can often make it worse. I consider 1GB the minimum to run XP well, and 2GB to run Vista/Windows 7 well. I have had many people, who I know and have helped personally, change their minds about buying a new computer after simply upgrading the RAM (and cleaning the viruses out, in some cases). 

It is much simpler than a script: Just copy the shortcuts to the Startup Program folder. It is located here on XP: 

If you do not have the original disk (as you stated), or have otherwise recorded it, there is no way to get that key back. I know of no manufacturer, even if you had support, who records and maintains that. 

The GoFlex has a removable base, which is the interface. Typically, most people would buy it with the new USB3 option, but you can buy it with USB2 or other interfaces. If you don't need to run the hard drive on computers with varying interfaces, you can just buy a unit with a dedicated USB interface, but I would buy one with USB3 at this point. 

You just install it twice, with different descriptive names (like HP_1320n_Watermark and HP_1320_Normal). You can just pick the driver out of the list, and it will ask you if you want to use the same driver, and you will answer yes. You then just change the settings for each printer as you want them. There is no issue with having two different "logical" printers printing to the same single physical printer. Another really easy way to do it is to install the printer with any driver you want (if you are not sure what to use), and then once installed, to to Properties>Advanced, and choose the same driver you are using for the printer that is already installed. If you have any questions as you do it, just post back, but it is easier than you think once you do it. 

I would go to their FTP site, and download, and run their "uninstalltiontool.exe". ftp://ftp.f-secure.com/support/tools/uitool It it does not work, boot into safe mode, and stop any F-Secure services that may be running, and kill any related processes, and then run it again. 

The network administrator should not give you the password. What he should do is remove it from your computer. At that point, even with these enterprise level products, most of these packages have an unmanaged version they could give you to use. In the alternative, after they remove it, just pick a different free AV to use. 

Interface-wise, the SATA-3 should be backward compatible, but I suspect that maybe your RAID controller is being particular due to the firmware. Try taking out the SATA-2 drive and seeing if you can get the controller to recognize only the SATA-3 drive. If so, you know your answer. If not, try it in non-RAID mode, or if you have another system, try the SATA-3 drive there to make sure it was not just DOA. This has all the docs for your drive, so you might want to keep this page: hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/products/Deskstar_7K3000 This is the Install guide, which I am looking at now: hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/â€¦ I see nothing about a jumper as on some of these drives have for compatibility. At this point, I would call Hitachi and ask them, and also see if they have a firmware update for one, or both drives.
