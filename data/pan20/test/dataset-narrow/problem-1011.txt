I could be terribly wrong here, but I don't think that your xorg.conf is to blame. Check the settings in System -> Preferences -> Display If that menu entry is not present, it is either disabled in the menu or the required package is not installed. You need to run which is included in the package. And if you are not using Gnome, just forget everything I just wrote. 

Take a look at the website of the Open Net Initiative. They "investigate, expose and analyze Internet filtering and surveillance practices in a credible and non-partisan fashion". 

(ssh to B and create a tunnel from the localport 127.0.0.1:2200 to the remote port A:22) Because CVS doesn't allow you to specify ports when using the protocol, this simple command line will not be good enough. What you need to do instead is create or modify your file: 

This will write (-a) and then re-read (-n) the history file each time bash prompts for the next command. Additional benefit: you'll get command X in shell 1 in the history of shell 2. 

Word assumes a fixed page width. That's why you can tell word how big a page should be. The web however, doesn't (or at least shouldn't) make any such assumptions. When writing HTML, either manually or using Word, you have no way of knowing how large the broser window will be when the HTML is rendered again. If you want a fixed layout that looks exactly as it looked in Word, convert your document to PDF and offer that for download. 

The first one that comes to mind is midnight commander (the package in the Debian and Ubuntu world). 

You should be able to achieve this by creating a userContent.css file in your Thunderbird profile directory. 

What you are looking for is described in Vim Tip 605. If you yank the first word with yiw, you can then replace another word with the first one by typing viwp. If you leave out the i, yw will also yank the whitespace after your word and when pasting this you get too much spaces. Therefore, use i to select the inner word. 

I really like the Inbox Zero strategy. Of course, it requires some effort, but you cannot expect effortless handling of email, can you? 

Are you using the correct screen resolution? Find out what the native resolution of your monitor is and make sure your laptop uses that. Is the monitor properly adjusted? Find the "Auto-foobar" feature that will adjust the display automatically. If both of these options don't help, you may have ended up with a laptop that has a very bad VGA signal, which isn't particularly rare. In that case, I'd try a smaller monitor with a smaller resolution. 

I am currently test-driving Opera 10 and the first thing that irks me is that I don't seem to be able to make it start without any open tabs. I also don't want speed dial. Just Opera without any tabs open. Is this even possible in version 10? 

Why did you try to install this from source? Use the Ubuntu packages and the system will keep them up to date: 

It seems to me that gksudo never does that. For example, gvim will give you a working shell back when you started it. But starting it with gksudo will block the shell. The easiest thing you can do is run it in the background: 

Since you are not using Compiz, you should check out your options under -> -> . The section contains at least two entries that might be helpful here: and . Maybe you can assign a single key shortcut to one of those. 

It seems like Linux is trying to use your phone as a modem, which is clearly not what you are trying to achieve. Don't know about the k750i, but on the SonyEricssons I had, you could configure what kind of connection the phone should perform when plugged into a computer via USB. 

In Ubuntu 9.04 using Gnome, this is most easily accomplished via the GUI. Go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard, switch to the "Layouts" tab and click the "Layout Options" button. You'll find several "Caps Lock key behaviors" there to choose from. You can make CapsLock and additional Escape and you can swap both, e.g. 

A little bit of heat might help. Use a hair dryer to heat the stickers and make the glue and little less gluey. Of course, if you're not careful, your shiny new laptop might morph a bit. 

These are two entries. The first one tells ssh to create a tunnel whenever you ssh to B. The second one defines the new 'hostname' that you can use for cvs. First, open the tunnel by ssh'ing to B: 

With SSH this is quite easy. Let's assume that your DB is listening for connections on 127.0.0.1:3306 on machine S. You want to access that DB from machine C. On machine C you simply do this: 

I guess this depends on the terminal emulator you are using. The article you linked to, for instance, mentions that the KDE terminal, Konsole, offers the desired behavior. 

Ubuntu may not be the right distribution for you. However, you can try to backports repositories. They have more bleeding-edge software, but not each software package in the regular repositories has its own backport. In short: your mileage may vary, but you should take a look the the Ubuntu-Backports. 

What drives me nuts is when people search for the right arrow key during a presentation instead of simply hitting space to get to the next slide. 

The obvious response to that question would be another question: WHY? But for the sake of whatever, you could change your current umask, make a copy of the file, delete the file and finally rename the copy to match the original. UPDATE: Note that this will only work changing the current permissions to more restrictive ones. The other way does not seem to work. 

That would heavily depend on the program. Just try that with IE. And besides: why would you want to? 

Check out System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. There is a section named "Sound" which lets you set shortcuts for system volume. 

Insert the command in your . This will append to the history file instead of overwriting it. Also in your , insert and the history file will be re-written and re-read each time bash shows the prompt. 

Rather than granting write access to the whole word, simply make yourself the owner of that directory: 

On your server, check the system logs in . I am not sure where failed login attempts get logged on your machine, but look for the log files that have been changed recently after a failed login and you should be able to come up with something. If that didn't help, try getting a verbose out put from ssh: . The output is hard to read and understand, but it might give you a clue about what might have gone wrong. It is also always worth checking that the public key you put on your server didn't end up there in multiple lines. One public key = one single line in the authorized_keys file. Finally, are you sure that public key logins are enabled on your server? 

Because of the size and the associated weight. Of course, especially when it comes to netbooks, the price is a major factor, too. 

I have been updating Ubuntu ever since 6.04. There was always a little bug that got introduced, but it was always possible to find a workaround or a fix. However: 

Changing file ownership can only be done by root. Ordinary user_a simply cannot create a file owned by ordinary user_b, whether file creation is done by gzipping or by gunzipping. If you need to preserve ownership, unzip as root. 

Medical equipment must be able to survive disinfecting. I guess this has a pretty severe impact on the screen surface. 

Use a virus scanner and a personal firewall, don't enable sharing on any of your drives and don't let others use your flash drive. 

If you are using openssh keys to login via ssh, you could simply disallow password logins for all accounts. ing would still be possible. 

You have to set your name and email locally. You should be able to do this via Tortoise's settings. Keep in mind that for git, a commiter is not necessarily the guy who pushes it to the remote server. Thus setting your committers' names locally should get you what you want. 

Opera 10 final works quite well on my Ubuntu 9.04 systems. Have you tried starting over, moving away your ~/.opera directory? You should be able to keep your bookmarks and wand passwords eventually, but for a first test, I'd simply move the complete directory (rename it) and see if that solves and problems. 

Since you are asking about a "bash command or something", I assume that you are on Linux or something. Try this: 

This will give you the size in megabytes of the directories contained in and . If you want the output to be sorted, pipe it through the utility: 

Stuff like this can be set on a per-user basis in which case you should be able to find something in your , or files. Or it can be set on a global level. In that case, I'd take a look inside , and . 

The same thing happened to me when I upgraded to 9.04. Here is what I did: Hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 to change to a command line terminal and log in. Now go to the directory `.config/autostart' in your home directory and create a file named 'nautilus desktop'. Copy the following content into that file: 

If you have a script that creates the download directory for you, it should not be a problem to let the script edit your Firefox preferences as well (of course, you'd have to do that before starting Firefox). Simply find your Firefox profile directory which should contain a file named 'prefs.js'. This line: 

bobince is almost correct. Checkout the devede-faq: I added a VOB file and marked the option "This is already a DVD/xCD-suitable MPEG file", but DeVeDe fails. The VOB files aren't fully suitable for DVDAuthor. In order to get the right file you can repackage it (without recompressing, so you will not loose quality) just marking the option Repack audio and video without reencoding. 

And vim will replace "some_unique_string" with "foo bar baz" as soon as you enter it in insert mode. 

There is no way to disable encryption - this is ssh after all. And it looks like compression is disabled by default as you have to request it with the switch. But you may want to check your file for settings regarding compression. If you add the following lines at the top of that file, compression should be disabled: 

Take a look at FreePOPs. Supposedly this also works with excite and it will let you use a normal, local email client to retrieve messages. 

You change your proxy settings system wide. There isn't anything else you can do, system-wide, to achieve what you want. If some applications don't honor the setting, your best bet is a bug report. 

Use the find's option. This will find files in the current directory that are either executable by their owner, by group members or by others: 

This is due of the peculiarities of the IMAP protocol. Strangely enough, the authors of that protocol not only thought about email when they dreamed it up, they also thought about usenet and newsgroups. The newsgroups of the usenet form a large hierarchy with thousands and thousands of groups. The original aim of IMAP was to support having the complete hierarchy available through your IMAP account. Of course, you wouldn't want all those groups to show up in your mail client, thus the concept of folder subscriptions was added to the protocol. If I remember correctly, Thunderbird also has an option to simply show you all your available folders without going through the motions of subscribing to single folders. It has nothing to do with offline use or synchronization. If you want to know more about the IMAP protocol, check out the corresponding Wikipedia article. You can also try to read the corresponding RFC which makes up the protocol and which is full of examples concerning usenet newsgroups (and has only a few examples that relate directly to email). 

It's been a while since I used Windows, but wasn't SHIFT+F10 a replacement of that key a couple of Windows versions back when the majority of keyboards didn't even have it?
