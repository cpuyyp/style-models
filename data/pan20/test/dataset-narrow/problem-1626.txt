I have a Netgear router that is compatible to flash DD-WRT. I have read you can use mac windows or linux. I only have a RPi3 no other computers. Will my Rpi3 work for this? I am running the latest Rasbian and have a 16G sd card. 

Maybe I missed something but I think sudo apt-get install, needs to know what to install. sudo apt-get install toilet for example. 

I would check the voltage one the tutorial link posted. It is for a 12v strip. Yours says 24v? Raspberry pi 5v. Seems a bit inefficient to me. 

I would start over. If you have started making or building files and directories and moving things or deleting things you are going to spend a lot of time trying to fix things that never should have been messed with. Burn Raspbian or NOOBS from Raspberrypi.org according to the instructions given on the downloads page. After you reinstall do not make,remove, or delete files and folders before you check simple things like spelling, punctuation and spacing as you type them in the terminal. Make sure you use sudo or have permission to do what are trying to do. You stated you did not think you had a boot folder, and also you made a boot folder to create a config.txt file. I will tell you this..you may have deleted, moved or renamed it but at one time you did. I personally do NOT mess around with folders like boot without caution and backing up my system. I would suggest you spend some time learning the file tree, how it works and what the files and folders are used for. Raspberry pi is very forgiving. You can mess up and just burn a new image to reinstall and keep going a million times. By taking time to learn about your system and how it works you wont need to reinstall a million times. This is not the answer you are looking for, but they way you asked the question and what you are asking for I believe this is the answer you need. There may be a series of commands that could potentially save the day and undo what has been done, but if you are just planning on typing in commands that you never understand you will always have problems. If you always have problems you are not having fun, and if you are not having fun what is the point. Trust me I was given the advice I am giving you. I was offended at first but I gave it a try and it is fun it takes effort but it is worth it. 

Then just create some script, and in call your script, and ensure the script will not get called in future. There are other possible solutions; in the issue discussion, one person explains how he made his own repository and package which he configured the installer to use. He also posted a link to the source. And there are one or two other suggestions as well. My method isn't perfect, but for the sake of keeping things short I will leave it as it is - it will get you off the ground. Mainly I suggest reviewing secirity since everything is done as root. But please do let me know if you have any issues or suggestions. 

How do developers of Raspbian test it on the Pi? If an install takes say 30 minutes, then that's 30 minutes for every combination of installation configuration and model of Pi and its components - let alone hardware that might be used with it. Would this be run on a farm of Pi's? (Or should that be a bakery...) Or the majority of the code split into modules that can be tested without going through the whole installation process? And I assume much of it is done on virtual machines that are close enough to being equivalent to the Pi? The reason I ask, is I use a minimal version of the Raspbian distro (FooDeas/raspberrypi-ua-netinst) and AFAIK it is slow to test; not ideal for development. I want to extend it, and maybe contribute to it, so wondering if there's a better way. 

is empty when I reboot. And when I manually try to mount it again, the url: serverip/owncloud (so basically the owncloud page) is empty. ( I think it's because I changed something while it was still running). Now dont take my word on the this but I thought about some possible situations/solutions, but I also have no idea how to solve this: 

I succesfully installed owncloud on my raspberry pi, but I want to upload files to my hdd when I upload on owncloud. So I did this: 

Can I make my files not just read only when I want to use my HDD normally and at the same time just use it for owncloud? (You need to set permissions to read only for owncloud to work) Can I just make my own php script which uploads it to my hdd which doesn't need read only? 

I bought this case: $URL$ Now i've got the upper part off the raspberry, but the down part isn't that easy to get off the raspberry Is there anyway to easily remove the case or is it just by pulling very hard? 

When I power up Pi Zero, I get to the page to boot into safe mode and the screen goes black for a few seconds and then flashes and shows four colored squares in the top right corner of my screen. If I try and press shift to boot into recovery it does the same thing. I have not seen this issue before is it my SD card or possibly a power problem 

$URL$ You will need to calculate that question yourself. The cost of mining and hash rate is unique to every miner. If this is endevor is a must for you I suggest you look at pooling if that is still an option. Keep in mind the calculations that are trying to be solved to actually get any bitcoin are very complex and take alot of power That needs to be apart of the equation. Join a bit coin forum they can help as most of the users are currently mining. 

If I use a password manager to store all passwords including my password for the pi itself. Does any type of text file or folder get created and stored anywhere on the raspberrypi..or only on the usb drive? 

Where it says the type "24Cxx" must be used: if an EEPROM has the prefix 24C, does this mean it might still be 5v only? And if it has that prefix, does that still mean it might not be 16-bit addressable, might be paged, might perform clock stretching, and might not have a WP pin that protects the entire memory? To save a lot of work, is there a list of potentially suitable EEPROMs? 

Beginning Raspbian Jessie (and I presume future versions as well), has been replaced by . So instead, follow instructions here. It will automatically log in as user To quote the answer, create this file: 

The systemd files ensure that when the installer is done and reboots that the system automatically logs in. The .bashrc file ensures that when it logs in that first time, it performs the remaining installation that you choose in the full Raspbian rather than busybox, which makes it a whole lot easier. 

Without USB devices attached to the Pi it should use under 1 amp., certainly nowhere near 2A. Mainly guessing, but your power supply is probably ok, since most now have 2.1A ports - and the fact that it only says it gives a total of 3A out implies to me that all ports share a single supply bus. Your cable might be a problem, some are better than others, but a higher rated cable would help. It might help to also have a shorter cable, but not necessarily. If you get unreliable operation from your Pi then I would first change the cable to one rated at 2A, and if still a problem, get a PSU that has a dedicated 2.1A output - both dirt cheap on eBay. But my guess is you won't need either unless you attach thirsty USB peripherals on the Pi. 

I have no idea if this would work, if I am right or how to do this> So I'll just ask a couple of questions first. Is one of the listed situations the situation I am in now? ( So will one of the solutions work?) Why is there a blank page on the owncloud url when I manually boot the hdd while the owncloud is still running? If one of the listed situations is the situation, how do I execute the solution? Also, if I dont change the data directory to the directory on my hdd,but keep it the same, it works perfectly. Of course I dont want it to keep it the standard since I dont wanna upload on the raspberry but on the hdd. Before mounting the hdd and accessing the owncloud will just give me the header of owncloud + an error saying: "Failed to connect to database" That's probably because the data directory doesn't exist because the hdd isn't mounted yet. So overall I think the thing that is wrong right now is: I boot the raspberry pi, so owncloud boots as well. The hdd isn't automatically connected, so I have to manually connect it while owncloud is still running. After mounting, I try to go to: raspberrypi-ip/owncloud and it's a white screen. In order to lose the white screen, I should reboot the raspberry. Which brings me back to the beginning. NOTE: I do use a powered usb hub 

I am running Raspbian jessie 8 on my RPi3. I am trying to see what version of samba is installed if any. I do not remember installing it as far as i know it is for remote access but I am not totally sure. It seems like when I update I see it updating but again i am not 100% sure. Can some one give me a hint on the command. I have already tried uname -a, smbd -v, and smbdstatus. 

Dude It is very well documented no motors for the pi. Get arduino, sparkfun, or adafruit micro controller for this stuff. Pi and Arduino work well together and both offer features the other lacks. Just as a reference check out the Arduino web IDE. Open file-examples and see all the possibilities instantly. RPi can not compare in this way 

I bought my son a pi zero w. Originally we he wanted Retropi. Now he wants to stream Steam instead. I found information that said adding a graphics card to RPI 3 it is possible to stream some games. I have found no information referencing the pi zero at all. Does this mean it is not possible? 

I think that the raspberry must be automatically mounted at booting since the owncloud automatically boots as well. The owncloud should be stopped, with a command(no idea which command) , then I can manually mount the hdd and I can start it again. 

So I am trying to set up owncloud and the tutorial I've been following tells me this: Let's assume your apache runs as "www-data" (as it e.g. would under Ubuntu). Then you should change all files to be owned by that user, like so: 

I'm trying to get my Raspberry to work on my TV screen and on my computer monitor, however, Whenever I connect through HDMI with my screen I get . I used to get this sometimes and by rebooting and take cables out and put them back in and it worked again. I had the same by using HDMI-DVI to my computer monitor but it would work if I just reboot or take cables out and put them back in. Now when i went back to work with my Raspberry again after like 3 months or so, it worked to DVI monitor perfectly. When I tried to connect my raspberry with my tv monitor I would get whatever I tried before it didn't work. But when I try to switch to HDMI channel I can only switch to it when BOTH the raspberry is connected with my TV screen and the raspberry is powered on. So the TV screen does recognize the raspberry. Anyone know how to solve this and what is going wrong? 

I want an external circuit to know when the Pi has started booting up and finished shutting down. How early/late is it possible to control the pins? And how might it be done? I'm thinking of writing a simple C program and using systemd to control when it's run. But how early/late would this actually be able to work? What software alternatives are there for controlling GPIO state as early/late as possible, short of recompiling the kernel or other high-skill methods? Also I want to avoid hacking the hardware, as I would want to make a hat for the Pi with this circuitry, and I want to be able to install it on a normal Raspbian installation 

The advantage of the Pi is once you have two of them working well together, it isn't too hard to get up to about 100 working together - limited only by the communication between them. (ZeroMQ) makes it relatively easy. 

Why? They use relatively little power, are easy to set up as a cluster since come with ethernet, and are quite cheap. If you use the graphics processor to crunch numbers, the Pi is actually rather powerful. They have minimal components, a powerful and efficient ARM processor, and are well-supported software-wise. They might not be the very most efficient solution in one way or another, but easy and affordable for a tech hobbyist. Like with any cluster, some possible uses: 

And the only thing I can change is not even the How do I setup my Owncloud server as I want in this screen? And why is the url so weird? Any one can explain how to set it up the right way from this menu? 

Now I have a problem with the setup since I can't acces my owncloud because of my permissions. Is there a different user that runs apache on Raspberry? 

I am using owncloud on the Raspberry Pi for file sharing and I use a HDD to save the files. I use my HDD for more then just the Raspberry and I had to change the permission of the HDD, so now when I open a file, I get every file in READ ONLY. I don't want this. Is there a solution for this? If not, I am thinking about just making my own php script which uploads to a map(in my HDD). So: 

I am trying to install owncloud on the raspberry and I found this link: $URL$ I followed every step but when I get to the sudo part, I get a different setup screen. (I am also new to Owncloud) See my Attachement. This is what it looks like:
