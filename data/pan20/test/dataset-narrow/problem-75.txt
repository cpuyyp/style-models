I'm trying to get the following system setup - I want a single client to get to two different servers - which both have the same IP address I have an ASA 5520 - ver 9.1(1) The commands for one NAT translation are as follows 

and I want to covert them to SSH. So I'll need to change their current method of logon. I've always used aaa new-model and so on and so whilst I don't believe its possible to use SSH without a user I want to know that this is true before I tell my customer. I've seen some articles about using certificates but nothing specifically about this. 

If I tracer 172.17.4.10 The firewall sees the udp packets (which is what I want) My problem is if I tracer 172.17.5.10 the firewall does not see the udp packets - and I see the traceroute going between 10.1.64.2 and 10.1.64.4 Tracer 172.17.5.10 

An "alternative" would appear to me to be (in line with answering "or if you can think of an even better solution") - Treat the switches and the network as untrusted and force the clients to use VPN to connect. This is my company's standard response to small offices (4 workstations seems small to me) due to the difficulty of controlling the physical switches on site .For the offices we use like this the printers can only be used when not on VPN or using direct USB. I'm not sure this is applicable for you - I either got confused about the switches you propose or you seem to have a requirement for a lot of ports for just four computers. 

means that traversal of that hop is mandatory. means that you let CSPF/MPLS TED (populated by OSPF or ISIS) handle how to get to the destination. And then when you create your LSP, you can tell it to use that specific path as primary/standby etc, ie: 

EDIT: I forgot to mention this - if you're interested, there have been books written about this topic. I highly recommend Bill Norton's The Internet Peering Playbook. Available in print or digital copies - it's pretty much the de facto text on this kind of stuff. DISCLAIMER: The examples used here are hypothetical only - I have zero insight into the business relationships of the carriers mentioned in the below post. The Internet is really controlled by the peering coordinators of the Tier 1 ISP's around the world. In the Internet connectivity business world, there's transit and peering. There are also various forms of peering (paid peering, settlement-free peering, etc) but for the most part, these are what Internet connectivity as a whole boils down to. Yes, it is complex because when it comes down to it, there is a cost involved with getting your bits from Oklahoma to Germany and back. It's not just technical jargon and routing policy - there are significant economic and business drivers involved as well. The term "buying transit" just refers to a contract where you're paying a provider money to get bits off of your network and on to someone else's network. Keeping to your example, let's say there are three providers involved with you sending traffic from your local office in Oklahoma to a branch office in Germany. Let's say your local provider is Hurricane Electric. Hurricane Electric gets the traffic to Germany via Level3. Level3 connects to a major German incumbent provider - DTAG, aka Deutsche Telekom AG. DTAG will then get your traffic to its final destination if the local office is buying transit from DTAG, or from someone else that relies on DTAG. So the connectivity would go something like this: 

I don't see how a transmit power of -5.5 dBm is being received as -1.4 dBm so my question is , Is it real - how am I receiving more power than I transmit? Can I control the transmit power ? (other than inserting the lead but not clicking it into place - which actually seems to work as shown by the receive level below 

Is there a way of setting up a Cisco swtich (Cisco Catalyst 3850 12 Port GE SFP IP Base - its not arrived so I don't know the IOS) to allow SSH without specifying a USERNAME The customer currently has many switches all setup allowing TELNET using 

And more importantly is this a problem ? I can see that the 1000BASE-ZX has a much higher transmit power than a receive power - so this would need an attenuation cable 

However this appears to require a IP address on the NET2 interface ( that is if I put address 192.168.20.1 on NET2 it works- However without the address present Packet tracer indicates that this address is not required - in that the following output occurs when there is no IP address on the interface. So the first question is the address on NET2 required? My problem is that I cannot put addresses in the correct sub-net on BOTH interfaces (NET1 and NET2) Output of interface config and packet tracer follows (The packet tracer command full text is 

If I ping 172.17.5.10 from Router2A the firewall does see the packets Router 3 is a 3750 , Router 2 are 3850s There is no device with an IP in the range 172.17.5.0/25 - I am using this to demonstrate the problem to myself So I'm close to saying this is a bug - I'm waiting for a reboot but my questions at the moment are 

My non-EE-background stab at an answer is: I don't believe fiber was initially looked at as a transmission medium purely for bandwidth reasons, but more for the fact that it [light] can travel much longer distances without amplification/regeneration, and the fact that it's immune to factors that electrical transmission mediums are not immune to, like noise for example. The higher bandwidth rates are a product of engineering done at the PHY level - I'm not sure if you're familiar with WDM technology, but basically it multiplexes light at various wavelengths to increase the total capacity of a single fiber pair - this gives you a higher aggregated bandwidth, but each wavelength still has a max of 10G (disclaimer: I'm not up on optical engineering news so it's possible that you can get higher rates per wavelength). There are certainly specs for (and maybe even small deployments of) 10G over copper, typically over what's called "direct attach" cables - they're twinax copper cables with SFP's on either side. There are also QSFP's which are 40G capable, but these will typically have one QSFP on one end and break out into 4 10G cables on the other end. 

All routers within an OSPF area keep a link state database (note that this is completely separate from the main routing table), where they're aware of all other routers and their links within the area. Each router within the area builds a topology tree of the area, with shortest paths to all other links/routers with itself as the root. This last part is important. When an area grows large, the link state database (the tree or topology) that each router must maintain also grows large. This means that it can become more and more intensive for the router to process link state (topology) changes as there are now a large number of entries in the link state database. The tree grows larger and is more difficult to "keep up" with as there become more and more branches/leaves of the tree. Something else to keep in mind is that as the area (network) grows larger, there is greater potential for link state changes, and thus a greater potential for recalculations of the link state database. While the details of which are somewhat "out of scope" of this answer, the OSPF link state update process is also relevant here. Ultimately, as a single area grows larger and larger, the SPF recalculations themselves will take longer to complete, and you have more risk of those SPF recalculations happening due to various reasons - the moral of the story is your routers' CPUs will be sad. The "advantage" of OSPF areas is that they provide a means to alleviate the demands placed on the routers if they were otherwise in a single area, by way of cutting down entries within the link state database and pushing responsibilities of the link state database maintenance to area border routers for their respective areas. It allows for a way to keep the tree size manageable. Thorough thought and planning is mandatory for designing/implementing multi-area OSPF - there are a number of situations where poor design in multi-area OSPF can bite someone. Using areas doesn't necessarily increase the "speed of communication" but it can have significant performance benefits (if done properly) to the routers in your OSPF network, especially if your network is very large, because their CPU's aren't having to work as hard. 

I have a pair of GLC-LH-SMD devices which are 1000BASE-LX/LH In the field they will be a couple of kilometers apart , but whilst I test the setup I only have 5m patch leads. I looked at the specs and Cisco state they are 

This is just some thoughts addressing the question - A packet cannot hop from one sub-net to another without routing - but the frame can go from VLAN10 to VLAN20 by a bridge eg a cable between two access ports would do that. But then the PC would be wrong to send an IP broadcast to 10.20.20.255 out a port configured as 10.20.10.10/24 as it should send it to a gateway based on its routing table So if a PC is only connected to 10.20.10.10/24 and you have no routers - the PC should not even bothering putting the data on the wire. So it appears you have no routers but you have set up a gateway or the PC is doing something with a packet for which its would appear there are no routes. So I would look at what the PC is configured as to see where the packet goes, then look at what that port is - and try and follow what the frame would do Still your understanding is correct - if no router then no way to swap from one subnet to another. However a VLAN is not a subnet. 

is "possible" as it appears you are adding the office network to the data-center firewall - So then the datacentre firewall would send all traffic out that port This is the "not a good idea to span subnets between sites" statement that Ron mentioned. However even with a new gateway located on a device in the office and connected to the new AT&T connection there is an issue of how the data-centre routing decides on which of the two links should be used to send traffic to the office network. You may need to "move" each office device one at a time. For each move you would modifying routing at both ends of the link. This depends on the capabilities of your routers. I think this is what you described 

Talking about terminology you've really already said transport which I think is what that type of service is most commonly referred to as. Sometimes folks will also refer to it as a "tether". You have another option of moving the interface on your side to the same router and then setting up eBGP multihop*** between you and your provider. Yes, you lose redundancy on your side, but on the opposite side it's going to the same router anyway, so that's kind of a moot point. This also eliminates the need for the provider to do eBGP multipath, in case they're not willing to do that with you (but I've found that in general most providers are fine with turning this on, if it's not turned on already). If that doesn't seem plausible then announcing two /25's is likely your best bet, unless of course your provider is willing to turn on (again, assuming they haven't done so already). ***Doing load balancing with eBGP multihop in your scenario will involve the following: 

You should now be able to add devices to GNS3 topologies on your Windows machine, and GNS3 will communicate with the remote hypervisor on another machine. You also get the console access via PuTTy and such for free as well. Note that there isn't really a "configuration limit" on how you want to add your IOS images and hypervisors. You could even have it so that you have a separate remote hypervisor per IOS image if you wanted. Pretty powerful stuff. If anyone could add additional answers on how to make this work with JunOS/"virtual" Olive, I think that would also be pretty useful. :-) 

Things start to get pretty vague near the bottom of that list. I also feel like I might be missing some important items entirely. What are all the things that need to be done when replacing failed Cisco ASA hardware? 

I have a failing Cisco ASA that is being replaced under a support contract. It is a single-point-of-failure in production at a branch office that can tolerate downtime. I will physically replace the device at that site myself. Prior to the hardware failure the configuration was just fine. My goal is to get back to the working state prior to the hardware failure. While I have worked a fair amount with ASAs I have never had to perform a hardware replacement so this is new territory for me. What I am looking for is a checklist, runbook, or procedure to serve the following purpose: 

For IOS Cisco published How to Choose IOS Software Release which, among other things, defines the nomenclature for the version numbers (ie. format ) and software image type (ie. vs. etc). I have not found an equivalent document for ASA. Surely there is some careful release engineering going on by Cisco to strive for stability in some ASA releases and new features in others. I haven't, however, found any document that helps me to sort between the two priorities. I expect to read the release notes to establish what features are available in each release, but without other information I'd still be guessing at how stable each release is. I guess I'm left with the following questions: 

I just finished the swap and definitely have much more clarity about what needs to happen to gracefully swap an ASA5505. There will be, of course, site-specific considerations, but I have tried to mention anything that probably applies in general. Setup and Pre-Configuration These tasks can all be done before taking the old ASA out of service. 

The easiest way to mess someone up on "classful addressing" either on a test, or exam, or whatever, is to use misdirection by way of a subnet mask. Again, remember that the subnet mask does not apply for determining the class of an address. This is easy to forget because as others have said, classless addressing and routing have been around for over two decades now, and the subnet mask and CIDR notation have become ubiquitous in the industry. 

As long as whatever routable address space either network is using on the "External" side is unique, yes, the "Internal" address space may overlap. 

In regards to practical application of the Opaque LSA, likely the most common implementation you'll see of this in the wild is in MPLS traffic engineering. In OSPF extensions for MPLS traffic engineering, Opaque LSA's are used to communicate traffic engineering interface parameters (such as maximum bandwidth, maximum reservable bandwidth, unreserved bandwidth, etc) throughout an area in order to populate the traffic engineering databases of the routers within the area. As for "how to use it" - you shouldn't have to, unless you're writing code that you would need to use it. In terms of practical application on a routing platform, on platforms I have experience with, there's not a specific knob you need to turn that "enables" Opaque LSAs. These should be implicitly enabled if you implement something that has dependencies on them, such as MPLS. 

You want to look for anything that has a '2' in the first column. You can then find the offender and grep for the IP to find the routers that it's configured on. This would likely be the simplest way. You're already on the right track with a Perl script to poll the devices via SNMP to get at the IP addresses, but I will say that SNMP code can be a little "hairier" than just simply using or to just log into the devices and dump the running configs to filehandles (at which point you can use the technique above). Assuming you're running Cisco, there's also a fairly comprehensive troubleshooting guide that covers this topic if you're interested.
