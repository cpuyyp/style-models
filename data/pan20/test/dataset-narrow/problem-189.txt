I have a job in my SQL 2000 server, this job is used to execute a DTS, i want to change the schedule of this job. but every time i try to change of delete or stop this job i get the error message 

Last part of your questions Please let me know this is good practice to move transaction log to some other drive. If not please suggest some other solution to recover from shrinking database log. Detaching & Attaching is good method if you can stop the the application that is in your case stop users from using sharepoint.. 

In SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Native Client Configuration, right-click Aliases, and then click New Alias. In the Alias Name box, type the name of the alias. Client applications use this name when they connect. In the Server box, type the name or IP address of a server. For a named instance append the instance name. In the Protocol box, select the protocol used for this alias. Selecting a protocol, changes the title of the optional properties box to Port No, Pipe Name, or Connection String. $URL$ 

Am sure there are different and better ways to get this task done e.g using cursors or sql functions, etc i thought of sharing my way of getting the task done. beginning create a stored procedure that will generate and execute the insert statements that inserts the dummy data The stored procedure takes in 1 parameter, the parameter is the no. of rows to be added to all tables the logic of the script is simple, a select of joined with & The has all column names the has datatype of the column the has table name, there are other ways to get table name like but i thought that joining sys.columns with is more convenient below is the code 

Updates: Make sure (HideInstance Flag is No) 1)In SQL Server Configuration Manager, expand SQL Server Network Configuration, right-click Protocols for , and then select Properties. On the Flags tab, in the HideInstance box, make sure its No. 2) Make sure (Sql Browser Service is Active) go to SQL Server Configuration Manager, check properties for SQL Browser service, in Advanced tab, make sure it is active & restart it 

If indexing which columns should i index and why Is it good idea to Partition the table Any Other suggestions 

i have 2 tables in my access DB, customer and contracts and they are related through the customerid, this is the script i use normally 

if your windows user has sysadmin privilege> login to your server as you do and after you login to your sql server using SSMS, go to security>logins>sa double click on sa and reset your password 

after that create a job that runs the stored procedure once a day or depending on the schedule you need. 

It has become very difficult to access this table now, a simple takes hours to execute. most of the columns in the table are just integers that's why i didn't do any indexing. What do you think i should do to improve this table, and increase the speed of query's to this table 

when the job fails for any reason (i lose that Days transactions) when for any reason the job run twice or i run it twice (i get duplicates) 

i doubt that the ALTER TRACE permission is a server level permission, and access is at the server level; if a user can start a trace, he or she can retrieve event data no matter what database the event was generated in. for more info $URL$ $URL$ 

The UDP communications gets "lost" on the way. UDP port 1434 are blocked on the network with firewall or windows firewall or IPSEC policy 

When you use EXISTS, SQL Server knows you are doing an existence check. When it finds the first matching value, it returns TRUE and stops looking. when you concatinate 2 columns and if any is null the result will be null e.g 

This will show you the Size of each log file of each database and will show you what space used in the transaction log or If the shrink operation runs without error as you said, but the file does not appear to have changed in size, verify that the file has adequate free space to remove by performing one of the following operations: Run the following query. 

in the BIDS, open your project and double click on your DSV file, you can right click any where and add a table and then do the rest of steps like adding a relation look at images Step 1 Step 2 Is that what you meant 

You cannot create a UNIQUE constraint and allow NULL in sql server, so i guess you can store default value 0 in the ext, and when displaying it you use case to display ext as empty value 

Stop the running sql server Login to your windows machine with the user that you gave access to the sysadmin group Start the mssqlserver service IN the SSMS chose windows quthentication mode when connecting to SQL you can then go to Server>Security>Logins>sa and change the password and enable the account 

after knowing when statistics is triggered it will help you decide when to update statistics manually to know more about Statistics & its effect on performance i recommend BrentOzar and Kimberly in sqlskills very good blogs & bloggers. 

a different approach you can have a separate table to store all the dates, just like a Date dimension table and then in your main table have a foreign key pointing to it 

These might be the reasons and i suggest using a product like sqlping to discover your sql on the network, because if it doesnt show up it doesnt mean its not there, its just the way its broadcasting is the problem 

View the Dates and notice that leap years have feb 29 and non leap years have only till feb 28 a non leap year 

this book is useful $URL$ and here is some reviews and nice articles about it $URL$ $URL$ slideshow $URL$ -- i also suggest watching these video tutorials by Learn it first as a start they can give you a basic but useful introduction Data Mining with Analysis Services $URL$ $URL$ -- chapter 11 of BI Architecture and Design Guide (best practices) is focused on Data mining $URL$ 

i suggest if you have an ID in the table to use it in the joins to find the exact record inserted to make it accurate like below 

Linked Server & Openquery suggested by @Aaron is simplest and fastest option for sql server to connect to remote server, but just to present the variety, you can also develop a SSIS package for sql 2005 & above or a DTS package for sql 2000, these are ETL tools of SQL server 

from the SQL management studio, connect to Analysis services and go to Roles, under the roles, the user that has been removed from active directory will appear in question marks "????????????????" , remove him and reprocess the cube 

the second part of the questions I will detach the database from SQL Server, then after the move particular .LDF file to some other location and attach only the database file back to SQL Server if you detach and move the ldf file, when you try to attach again you will see a message (Not Found) and be given the option to either point to its new location or just remove it and if you remove it a new transaction log file will be created . 

and in your case its the opposite, so Performance decreases if you are using 1 backup device to restore 2 different databases for more on Backup and Restore Performance in SQL Server check section Using Multiple Media or Devices So i guess the answer to your question, is Its possible to restore 2 databases from same file but not Wise 

you can use the DateID as a foreign key in your main table This way you have day, month and year seperate and you also have the Date in dateformat for any date related functions for reference the script to generate a date dimension i used this site $URL$ 

or if you want to get data from ADSI, you will need to create a linked server connection to ADSI and get users info $URL$ $URL$ and use the where clause finally check this article "SSRS 2008 R2: Implementing Row-level Security" $URL$ 

I tried your script and recreated your environment completely and i didn't see any error. Ran perfectly and created all tables and transferred all data successfully i tried running under a sql agent job and still no error was generated but i guess you can update your insert script by making sure the column gets converted under all conditions 

Start the instance of SQL Server in single-user mode by using either the -m or -f options. Members of the Windows Administrators group now have access to SQL Server when SQL Server is in started in single-user mode, also known as â€œmaintenance mode". Stop the SQL Server Agent service. Otherwise, SQL Server Agent might connect first and prevent you from connecting as a second user (just like you did) Start server in single user mode 

now i am trying to design a way where i over come these 2 problems as well as am trying to develop the ETL in such a way that it can auto fix it self incase any of these events occur. i want it to check if there are missing days and run run the ETL for that day, and check if there are duplicates and delete them. below are ways i though of 1. i take in the last 5 days regardless, every day the ETL runs, deletes the last 5 days and refill. 2. i check the destination tables if they have missing dates in the last month and then i query the source with the missing days. keeping in mind that the source is a huge table in a production environment that i have to optimize my query to the maximum when requesting from it. thanks 

This code below adds a trigger to your table that works after insert, it updates the name added and replaces the with 

SSRS in the Report Model is available in sql 2008 R2, but not in express edition check $URL$ and here is how to apply it on sql 2008 R2 $URL$ and if you want to create a view and get TSQL and AD to talk you can use the following functions to get username 

if you want to use triggers thats your call, i am just suggesting a different approach you can use the feature of a table e.g in your , you can make the default value of by below script 

Usually its suggested that this is the opposite of the way you are doing it, so yeah restoring 2 database from the same media device will effect performance because IO operations are happening on the same disk at the same time.

Why does sqlcmd -Lc does not show the local instance? and in your case even if sql server service is working. ok first will talk about what sqlcmd -Lc does it "Lists the locally configured server computers, and the names of the server computers that are broadcasting on the network" for reference and a note to keep in mind is "Because of the nature of broadcasting on networks, sqlcmd may not receive a timely response from all servers" for reference SQL server browser service is the service that Broadcasts and upon startup, SQL Server Browser starts and claims UDP port 1434. if you unplug your machine from the network and type sqlcmd -Lc, you wont be able to see your machine listed, because If it doesn't get a reply from other available SQLs , it doesn't list itself. Now to know more about why sometimes sql server doesnt show up, you need to know about UDP and how sql server uses it to discover other sql servers UDP is a connection-less protocol UDP does use ports, it allows multiple processes to be using UDP at the same time. Since it's connection-less, any connection-like properties between two systems must be handled by the application. It's a fairly small protocol and therefore takes up relatively little bandwidth on the wire. SQL Server, uses UDP in two ways To discover other SQL Servers that are out there. To discover how to connect to a named instance. now after knowing how sql server service works and how it uses UDP here below is list of reasons why you dont see your local instance showing up 

the Overwrite the existing database, do it only if you are sure you want to override your existing database as you mentioned you dont care to delete it RESTORE WITH RECOVERY is the default behavior which leaves the database ready for use by rolling back the uncommitted transactions. Additional transaction logs cannot be restored. That should bring the database online. Then you can delete it & try again. 

I wanted a Script that can loop through all tables and their columns in the database and insert dummy data based on column type and size, so that i can start using the database for testing, and ability to run queries and Test Apps. 

While trying to Process a cube i go this error "Error 133 The following system error occurred: No mapping between account names and security IDs was done. 0 0" i know its some user which is available in the roles have been removed from active directory. the annoying part in this is the error doesn't indicate which user has been removed from active directory, our SQL is setup as windows authentication. and i have to go and check one by one. is there a way to identify the user, so i remove it and continue with the processing 

in your query above, every time some one views your view, an is executed to your server why don't you run a job that transfers the data from your progress server to your sql server and create a view pointing to a table in your server locally. that will be much faster 

When To Update Statistics? if and only if auto update statistics feature is not good enough for your requirements. i mean if auto create and auto update statistics are ON and you are getting a bad query plan because the statistics are not accurate or current then it might be a good idea to have control over statistics creation and update. but if you are fine with your sql server performance and Query execution times. then i suggest stopping the Updates Statistics command from your Maintenance Plans updating statistics is important and useful 1. allows the SQL Server query optimizer to produce good query plans consistently, while keeping development and administration costs low 2. Statistics are used by the query optimizer to estimate the selectivity of expressions, and thus the size of intermediate and final query results. 3. Good statistics allow the optimizer to accurately assess the cost of different query plans and then choose a high-quality plan 

from simple-talk Section 13. When is the Auto-Update to Statistics Triggered? support.microsoft Section: Automating Autostats determination msdn.microsoft section: Maintaining Statistics in SQL Server 2008 

you wont find the exact scripts that were executed on sql.(in the transaction log) A transaction log is a file that contains information regarding every change that has been made to the database. This includes data modifications (transactions), database modifications, and backup/restore events. The primary purpose the transaction log is to provide a method to be able to restore a database to a point-in-time when necessary. This can include rolling back transactions to a certain time, or to roll forward transactions from a full backup restoration. to know more about Transaction log $URL$ here is a script to show you recent ran delete queries 

I have 2 type of tables to populate the data-warehouse with every day, lookup tables or configuration tables with few 100s records, and thats easy where i just truncate and refill the table. but for transaction tables, that have many records, i usually increment, that is i run the ETL daily to add yesterdays records. i have 2 problems that i face always 

I was wondering is it feasible or doable to work from home as a DBA or Database designer/developer or Business intelligence developer. I have seen developers doing great working from home, but can DBAs work from home and be productive or do they have to physically be at work. 

try the FILESTREAM feature in SQL server, FILESTREAM integrates the SQL Server Database Engine with an NTFS file system by storing varbinary(max) binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system nice articles about it
