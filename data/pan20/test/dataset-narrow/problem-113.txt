Technically, any MAC address with a in the I/G bit is a broadcast address, even multicast addresses, which must have that bit set to show it is a group address: 

If these are your only two routers, you have a problem: there is no common network on which these routers can communicate. Routers need a common network between them in order to even communicate with IP, much less with a protocol (e.g. OSPF) which uses IP. OSPF could never form a neighbor relationship if the FastEthernet ports on these routers are connected to the other router as the only links between the routers. 

All the hosts see the ARP request, but only the requester will see the ARP reply. Since ARP replies are unicast back to the requester, Host C will never even see the ARP reply from Host B. How hosts populate their ARP caches is not how switches populate their MAC address tables. Switches look at all the traffic coming through switch ports to populate their MAC address tables. 

It may be a hub or WAP connected to that interface. In that case, it probably needs to be an access interface. If it is a switch, then you should match the configuration of the switch connected to it. The best practice is to connect switches with a trunk link, even if it only has a single VLAN. You can restrict the VLANs allowed on the trunk to a single VLAN, native or not. You cannot add VLANs to an access interface later, but it is a simple matter to add VLANs to a trunk. There will be no performance difference between an access interface and a trunk interface. 

The ICMP message is not the text message you see; it is a code which means destination unreachable. The text message is created by the OS of the device on which you are running Telnet, or by the Telnet application itself. On Cisco interfaces, you can use the command to suppress the interface from generating the ICMP destination unreachable response. This would need to be configured on the target interfaces, not the interface from which you are using Telnet. Cisco IOS IP Command Reference, Volume 1 of 3: Addressing and Services, Release 12.2: 

Basically, with IPv6, most subnets will just be /64. Using subnets of other sizes, with a couple of exceptions, will break features of IPv6. See RFC 5375, IPv6 Unicast Address Assignment Considerations, especially Section 3. Subnet Prefix Considerations: 

You really haven't provided enough information to be completely sure, but a router coming up first will decide it is the DR, and if there is already a DR, there will not be a DR election unless the DR goes down. Also, according to RFC 2328, OSPF Version 2, the BDR is elected first, which appears to be the case in what you have in your question. If Router 2 is the DR, then Router 1 is elected as the BDR. The algorithm for DR/BDR election from Section 9.4: 

RFC 4291, IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, Appendix A has the full explanation. Basically, you split the 48-bit MAC address down the middle, insert to extend it to 64 bits, and flip the U/L bit. This creates the 64-bit Interface ID which you append to the end of the 64 bits of the Global Routing Prefix and Subnet ID combination. For Link-local addresses, the created Interface ID is appended to the Link-local prefix (). Some people are concerned that you can use a unique number, like a MAC address, to track a particular host. To correct this, RFC 4941, Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 was created. Windows and many Linux variants use random addressing by default, but this may be disabled. 

Modern layer-2 switches perform almost all switching in hardware. This facilitate wire-speed switching. Switching in software will slow down switching. Switches use software for added features. Inconsistently, your last paragraph asks about routers. Routers do some things in hardware, but they use software because they need to support different interfaces and protocols. This, for example, allows a router to be upgraded to support both IPv4 and IPv6. Business-grade routers often have modular hardware, and you can get some very diverse hardware combinations. This really needs software support 

None of those commands should have any effect on your networks. The command simply means that the router will forward ND packets for diskless workstations. This is rather obsolete. The commands are for the HTTP server in the router itself. It is a way to configure the router with HTTP, and it means nothing to anything else connected to the router. 

Jamming when it is no longer needed will slow collision recovery, and therefore, unnecessarily reduce throughput on the link. 

As you read in the ISO/IEC 7498-1:1994(E), the Transport Layer is defined as both connection-oriented and connectionless. There are explanations about using it both ways (I highlighted the relevant text in this section, but the entire document speaks to connectionless-mode): 

No. There are no such things as jumbo packets. There are such things as jumbo frames at layer-2. Frames, at layer-2, are sent directly from host to host on the LAN. Routers strip off the frames in order to forward the packets, and they create new frames for the next network to which the packets are forwarded. Packets may be fragmented by routers if the MTU of the next network is smaller than the packet size. The packet fragments are then routed as individual packets, and the destination host will reassemble the packets. Routers route packets individually, including fragments, regardless of any other packets. A router's primary job is to route packets as fast as possible, and fragmentation and reassembly take considerable router resources that are better spent routing the packets, which is why the standard is that router fragments the packets as necessary in order to be able to deliver them, but the destination host is the one to reassemble the packet fragments. From RFC 791, Internet Protocol: 

Most hosts will not recognize tagged frames, and will discard tagged frames, so the hosts will only use the untagged VLANs. Packets from the router will only be addressed for the network of one VLAN, and the router will only use the MAC address of the destination host, so the frames will still only be delivered to a single host. Switches also will build MAC address tables, and they will then only deliver frames to the interface where the MAC address was last seen. This is really a security problem because some hosts, e.g. servers, can be configured to trunk, and this allows them to send and receive traffic on multiple VLANs. Also, broadcasts, e.g. ARP, may be leaked to other VLANs, allowing an attacker to see and spoof a MAC address. This configurations is really goofy, and you should have a really good reason to do it. 

These are two completely independent protocols. VRRP doesn't interact with OSPF, or vice versa. VRRP will create a virtual gateway, and one router (layer-3 switch?) will be the primary and the other router will be the secondary which takes over if the primary router fails. This has nothing to do with the routing protocol. The real concern with an FHRP is that it match its primary router with the STP root switch for the VLAN. Not matching the FHRP primary router with the root switch can cause sub-optimal traffic paths as the layer-2 traffic is switched to the root switch via STP, then to the other router (layer-3 switch) as the FHRP primary gateway. OSPF will populate the routing tables of the routers, and whichever router the traffic goes to (based on the FHRP) will route the traffic based on the best route in the routing table. 

Category-3 cable, is used for 10BASE-T ethernet (10 Mbps), but it can't branch or have a bunch of connections, and you aren't allowed to splice. If you need anything faster, you need to use Category-5E, installed to specification. You would be better off using the Category-3 cable to extend from the DMARC to where you can place the modem close to the router. 

Then place all the interface configurations in common for that channel to an access switch under the channel interface. After that, you add the physical interfaces to an access switch to the channel under the physical interface configuration. It depends on the particular channel protocol you want to use. Unconditionally channel: 

Hosts will send IGMP membership reports to the multicast router, and the multicast router will periodically send out multicast membership queries to see if any hosts on the LAN are still interested in the multicast group traffic. Beyond that, it depends on the IGMP version. I'm not sure why you think routers only listen to ; routers are also just hosts on a LAN, and while they must listen to that multicast group, they also must listen to , and any other multicast groups to which you configure them to listen. When you configure multicast routing on a router, part of it is setting up IGMP on the interfaces which will be used. 

There are certain blocks of multicast address space reserved for certain things. For example, the block is reserved for local network control (Link-Local), and multicast addresses in this block should not be forwarded to another LAN, even with multicast routing enabled. See the IANA IPv4 Multicast Address Space Registry and IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry. The Ad-Hoc blocks are used to register/reserve addresses for various functions, but it requires "Expert Review, IESG Approval, or Standards Action." Basically, you need to get a consensus. The best way would be to get an RFC approved, but notice that some companies have registered multicast address space. For example, is registered to the Walt Disney Company. 

When you subnet a network, you do not advertise the full network from both places. Assuming you have the network, and you want to use half at each data center, then you advertise from one data center, and from the other data center. You do not advertise from both data centers, only advertise what is being used. 

Your answer to the question is incorrect. There are multiple ways routers can learn which interfaces should be used for which network: 

That depends on how the interfaces are configured and used. On a bridge (or a switch, which is a type of bridge), each interface is its own collision domain. If there is only one device connected to the interface, and that device supports full duplex, then the bridge can run that interface in full duplex if the single device does because there are no possibilities for collisions. If there are multiple device connected to that one interface, then there may be collisions, so the bridge interface must run in half duplex. Inside the bridge itself, there are no collisions, so frames can travel between the different ports simultaneously. In one sense, that may be called full duplex, but each bridge interface has its duplex set independently of how the other interfaces are set. Some could be full duplex, and some could be half duplex. 

You really don't seem to understand what the Internet is. It is simply a bunch of ISPs all connected to each other. The ISPs comprising the Internet have agreed to certain protocols. Each ISP is connected to at least one, and probably multiple, other ISP(s). When you send or receive traffic on the Internet, it probably crosses multiple ISPs to reach its destination. It may be that the source or destination of your traffic is on the same ISP you are, but that may be unlikely. 

Whatever you end up using, make sure that the cable installers use the same format for the cable test reports they present to you. You want to be able to look up, sometimes years later, the insertion loss or PSNEXT of a cable as tested at installation, and you need to to be able to relate the test to the actual cable. 

You can think of the virtual link as an OSPF tunnel. ABR B acts like it is an Area 0 border router, and the LSAs it sends to ABR A are the same as any Area 0 border sends into Area 0. ABR B will also receive from ABR A any LSAs that any Area 0 router receives. Any routers in Area 1 will only pass along IP packets from ABR B to ABR A, they will not directly use the LSAs since those routers are not the destination of the IP packets carrying the LSAs. LSA are carried in IP packets which are like any other IP packets and have source and destination IP addresses. The routers routing IP packets do not look in the IP packets unless the packets' destination IP address is an IP address on the router. There is a full explanation of OSPF, including virtual links, in RFC 2328, OSPF Version 2. 

What you seem to be proposing is running HSRP toward the ISP routers in attempt to fool your own routers, but HSRP is a protocol designed to fool LAN hosts, e.g. PCs. On your layer-3 switches, you will have one or more VLANs configured in SVIs. For example: 

A broadcast must be passed to the upper layers in order to evaluate it to see if it is relevant for the host, and that needs to be handled in software. Broadcasts do have an effect on host performance, but not as much as before since we now have faster and multi-core CPUs. Broadcasts also use, possibly unnecessarily, bandwidth, but we also have faster networks. Faster processors and faster networks could also mean more broadcasts, too. It is still a very good practice to limit the size of the broadcast domain. It used to be, "Switch where you can, route where you must." That is no longer strictly true, and an emerging best practice is to use layer-3 switches, instead of layer-2 switches, as access switches. This eliminates problems with things like spanning tree, and allows more granular layer-3 security features. Very few thing we use today depend on hosts being on the same layer-2 network; we live in a layer-3 world. 

While what you are doing may work for the traffic, it is a very bad idea. Trying to run a port channel across links that changes speed on the link can cause problems. 

IPv4 packets can be fragmented, so multiple packets may be needed to recreate the original packet. IPv6 packet header: 

IP is a layer-3 protocol, but you have a layer-2 switch. When a port is configured as a switch (layer-2) port, you can't assign an IP address to it. It doesn't make sense to assign a layer-3 address to a layer-2 port. IP is a layer-3 protocol, so you assign it to layer-3 ports. The layer-2 switch can have a layer-3 SVI port to which you can assign an IP address, but your switch isn't a router or layer-3 switch, so an IP address on your SVI is only for switch management. If you want to have multiple VLANs and route between them, you need a router or a layer-3 switch. If you had a layer-3 switch, you would need to make sure that you have IP routing enabled. You could then assign IP addresses to the ports, but you would first need to use the command. 

The one-MAC-per-port design decision really has nothing to do with STP since all the MAC addresses will be relatively in the same ballpark as far as value, and STP takes into account the port number when making decisions. It is likely that the separate MAC addresses per port are easier to use for the switch's STP port decision if the MAC addresses increase in value as the port number increases. STP will not loop if the same MAC address is used for all the ports. On the contrary, it would be more likely to loop if the MAC addresses are different, but it is unlikely that such a problem would get through product testing, or survive long in implementations. 

Since R1 is not connected to the network, you have two options: create a static route in R1, or run a routing protocol between R3 and R1 to advertise the route from R3 to R1. A statically configured route in R1 would look something like: 

Unfortunately, multicast or broadcast on Wi-Fi is a problem. Your WAP will send multicast and broadcast at the lowest possible rate. This is part of the Wi-Fi standard. There is a proposed standard that is supposed to fix some of the problems with multicast on Wi-Fi, but nothing currently supports it, as far as I can tell. For example, if you have a WAP that supports 802.11b (as you seem to indicate), it will send multicast traffic at 1 Mbps.
