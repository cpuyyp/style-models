Ok, it's clear that you will eventually implement some solution that will not be very secure. I guess you'll have some written statement for the client about the risks. I suggest that in that written statement you also show the customer how easily that competitor's solution can be used to print multiple copies. 

When IMAP has been enabled and the IMAP ports have been opened in the firewall, then in OS X Leopard: 

The following works too, even though is has different results when running the above commands again: 

Just for the sake of completeness, one can also tell the Bash shell to include hidden files, using : 

Not exactly what you asked for, as it's not based on tokens, but: you could join FON, and open up your (cheap†) Fonera router for paid access (not limited to you own guests, if the Wifi range is good). A software solution I never tried, and which seems a bit hard to set up for a regular user, is CoovaChilli. It needs a WPA Enterprise router, and then offers authentication services to selectively --through a so-called captive portal-- share your access point. † Old Fonera routers are just €30, the newest €79 / $99. 

Two options, I guess: Await a very personal message and force the original recipient to act on that. If no response, send that message (including all its headers) to Gmail customer support? If is threatened to be blacklisted by Gmail then maybe they'll finally act... (But, you raised a valid question: does Gmail have some customer support department...?) Or: filter on the header containing . Hopefully they do not have too many mail servers. And hopefully that will not block mail from rr.com subscribers addressed to you. I don't know if Gmail allows for such filter. But if you are using Mac OS X Mail, then you first need to add the Received header to the list of selectable headers: 

Just a thought: I did not read the linked article, but: enabling backups is one thing, while restoring might need some more tweaks? I kind of doubt the installation disc will offer you to restore a full system when it's on an SMB share. 

I noticed as Cyberduck has some trouble, but indeed, on a first generation MacBook, 32 bit, Snow Leopard: 

Too bad, this is caused by the way the web site tries to get information from the other frames. Maybe the things named "detail" and "ust" just don't exist and Internet Explorer ignores that. Or maybe this is just non-standard, IE-only. Bad implementation. (I'm sure someone could create a Greasemonkey script to replace the CSS on the fly, as a workaround. Some script might also fix the bad JavaScript, but as IE works I guess that's a bit too much.) 

My guess would be that the emails are sent as plain text, and that your new Outlook is using a proportional (non-fixed width) font to show that. But we'd need more details to be sure, like maybe a screenshot and some of the non-personal headers of the email message. Outlook 2010 - plain text not lining up indeed claims: 

Maybe you can use some proxy server? And maybe services like www.hidemyass.com use some fixed IP address? 

Save this as an array formula: after typing it, hit Ctrl+Shift+Return (or Command+Shift+Return on a Mac). It will then show in curly braces. And it will not have a single cell as its results, but as many cells as the range you're working on. In the example above, you'd get 3 cells, with values 1, blank and 3. Next, use to find the Nth value: 

(An email sender will look up the so-called MX records of your domain. Though one can define multiple records for fallback servers, those will only be used if the primary server does not respond, not if the primary server does not know your email address. Hence: email senders will always try to deliver all email for some domain to the same provider, or will return the message if that fails.) 

In my experience domain names are often registered by domain squatters when you release them. I've seen the oddest names being registered by domain squatters after the original registration expired and were released because the administrative contact messed up (or the contact details were wrong). I don't know where the squatters get their information, but it seems they know. So: when registering multiple domains, make sure you can afford to maintain them. If not, then let sleeping dogs lie. (And as for the "all" in your question: that's not doable.) 

In Ubuntu, probably yields , telling you your Ubuntu session is using display 0. That should leave any other number for you to use. So, should have been fine, unless there's still some running from a previous test? (Or, like the error states: unless some temporary file was not removed after some earlier test.) But: if you cannot figure out what is using display 1, then any other higher number should do as well. A quick test in a fresh Ubuntu 9.10: 

A bit outdated since the question was altered, and for me it's mostly fun and not really usable, but that is a matter of taste: eyeos. (Or see the demo.) (I especially would like a way to keep the session running after closing the browser. It would also be good if browsing through eyeos is proxied over the server. The latter is possible, but more like a proof of concept. The new eyeos 2.0 was delayed a bit, but it's available since February 1st, 2010. My highlights: collaboration on documents, and (upcoming?) synchronisation of files, contacts and agendas with your home computer. The demo/public server at eyeos.info has not been updated yet.) 

The above results might have been cached by your router/modem, or were delegated to your ISP's DNS server for anything the router did not yet know. The value for might be some indication if the result was cached in the modem/router or not. So, run that very same command again (press arrow-up and Return in Terminal): 

(Eventually press and type to exit Telnet.) Note that in the actual message above your own email address is not mentioned at all. This is also how BCC is handled; it often does not use the header, as then the sending party could not deliver the same message to multiple recipients of the same provider in one go. Upon receiving this message, this yields: 

You can enable SSH access using , or to listen to a non-privileged port (hence not requiring a password). 

It is not clear to me if machines that have been upgraded to XP SP2 are also subject to the new default. I guess they are, and if NAT is indeed used in your situation then I assume the older machine is running 2000 or earlier? Or if upgraded machines are not subject to the new default, then maybe the older machine was installed with XP prior to SP2, and then upgraded to XP SP2 or later? (Please provide some details for later readers.) (The required mappings from the first lines of the Wikipedia quote makes it impossible to have multiple VPN clients behind the same cheap home router that uses manual port mapping. The router can then only apply that mapping towards one of the clients. But I assume most modern home routers will support multiple clients nowadays.)
