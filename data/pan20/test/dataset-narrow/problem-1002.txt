I haven't tested this, but this seems right. (Note: your naming convention is confusing since is really a string rather than a range. 

Copy your entire table and paste it on a new sheet. Select your new table and Remove Duplicates (Data ribbon -> Remove Duplicates) on columns and . This will provide the framework for the condensed table. In B2 (the first entry for ) enter the following: 

Fill this down 11 more rows and then over 9 more columns. Go back to the top-left cell (the first one you entered the formula into) and change its formula to the following: 

If your numbers are in column A, you could enter the following in column B and fill down to assign a category to each. 

To use this formula in your workbook, replace all "6"s with the row number of your target location, replace all "5"s with the width of your table (not counting the header), and replace "K$1" with the address of the top-leftmost cell in your original table (the "A" in your example). Then fill down. 

Fit a line to all your data and use this line to find when the project will be 100% complete. Use only your start and end data points to make a quick-and-dirty linear model and use it to find the 100% complete date. 

In Column , I have a compressed list of these random dates. This list is generated using the array formula below. 

is almost certainly a named range. Use the Name Manager on the ribbon to find out where it is in the workbook. Name Manager can also be accessed by pressing Ctrl+F3. 

Since you're looking for exact matches, the MATCH function will probably be sufficient for this. If the item number you want to check is in and the list of recently ordered items is in on the sheet, you can enter this formula: 

I think it would be easier to manage if you had an extra column where you could simply mark whether a row is active, say with an "x". Then you could have the ordinal rank of each active row calculated automatically in the next column. For instance, if you make Column B hold "x"s to denote the row is active, in Column C you can enter the following (in ): 

Remove Duplicates keeps/removes records based on their position in the column. For each unique value, the record that appears first (highest up) in the column will be kept and any subsequent duplicates will be deleted. I suspect the first time you used this, your data was sorted by date from oldest to most recent, so it behaved as you wanted. Sometime after that, your data for whatever reason was no longer sorted by date. To make sure Remove Duplicates works as you want it to, just be sure to sort your data by date from oldest to most recent before using Remove Duplicates. 

returns the column number of the current cell ( in my example) and returns the column number of the cell that holds . This is written so that the row offset increases by one as the formula is filled to the right. If you're going to put the output somewhere other than in line with the row, you'll need to tinker with this to get it right. 

You can get what you want with a helper column and a filter. Step 1: Helper column Add a column to your table with the following formula, where the names are in and the values are in . 

One workaround is to make your data a dynamic named range. This will allow you to apply the conditional formatting to the named range by name, which will remain constant, while the range the name applies to may change as you add or remove data. How to set up a dynamic named range: Go to the Formula ribbon and click . In the Name Manager, click to create your named range. Give it a descriptive name (no spaces) like . In the field you can use a formula to define the named range. Something like 

Select the range you want to apply the conditional formatting rule to and go to on the Home ribbon, then . From there choose and enter the formula below. 

When executed, this will return in table form the DiscussionID, the UserID, and the number of posts by that user in the discussion for each who has more than one post. Of course, you'll have to change the table and field names to match your database. To find the users who have posted both pro and con in a single discussion, you can use the following query: 

If you are using the rollback feature from my original post, some additional modification will be needed to store cell fill color history so that the fills can be rolled back. Let me know if this is something you would like to use, and I'll try to post a modified version of the code. 

Copy your entire table from Excel and paste it into a text editor. If your data is like your sample data (5-row chunks, not 4, and each record starts with ), you could search for the pattern 

You can do find the amount of the greatest decline using a helper column. For values in , enter the following in and fill down the column: 

The function returns when yields and error, and otherwise. So, you have to reverse the order of the and arguments in your function. 

Save a copy of your entire sheet as .csv. While still open in Excel, delete the columns you don't want. Save. 

Excel assigns PERCENTILES to each value in the array. P(4) = 0; P(6)=0.20; P(8)=0.40; ... ; P(16)=1 Excel then checks where the requested percentile falls in the array. For Q1, 0.25 falls between 6 and 8. Excel then linearly interpolates between these values based on the percentile. 0.25 percentile is 0.05 percentile higher than 0.20 percentile. 0.05/(P(8)-P(6)) = 0.05/0.20 = 1/4 So, the 25th percentile is 1/4 of the way between 6 and 8. Thus, 6.5 is the returned value. (I realize you typed 5.5, but I checked your data in Excel, and 6.5 is returned quartile. Likewise, 13.5 is returned for Q3 instead of 14.5.) 

I don't believe there is a way to make a cell cycle through formats using Excel's native conditional formatting functionality (you can probably do it in VBA, but that seems overkill to me). However, there's a simple enough workaround: For each rule, you can use different formats that aren't incompatible with one another. For instance, Rule 1 can apply a red font, Rule 2 can apply bold text, Rule 3 can apply a blue left border, Rule 4 can apply a red bottom border, and Rule 5 can apply a yellow fill. As long as each format is compatible with the others, you will be able to see exactly which criteria the cell met. Example: 

One solution is to use Excel's Data Table feature. The Data Table is one of the What-If Analysis options available (in Excel 2007 -- I can't confirm this, but I assume it's still in Excel 2010). The following is an example of how to use this feature, which should be useful because the Microsoft help file is light on instruction IMO. To use your example, you want to calculate the formula = 3*x+15 for several different values of x. Where holds some dummy value of x, enter the following in : 

Sort your data by and (A to Z) in that order or priority. Add a column . The value of will be the earlier of the maturity date for that record and one day before the next issue_date for that specific ID. Assuming is in column A, is in column B, and is in column D, enter the following formula for the of the first record. Fill down.
