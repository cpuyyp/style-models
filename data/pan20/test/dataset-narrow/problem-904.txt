Is there a way to make this configuration backwards compatible, so that the new option is used for newer clients and ignored for older clients? 

I have a number of VMs that were based on the same template, each with about 2GB of storage. They all share read-only access to a 50GB volume (currently via NFS, but that is up for negotiation). I want to package up that template and volume so that a similar arrangement can be reproduced in another virtualized environment. Ideally that package would be about 52GB in size, and would allow another admin to create an environment with an arbitrary number of VMs. How should I tackle this? Can I accomplish this setup, or something similar, using OVF, or do I need to use something more proprietary like a vApp, or even a combination of multiple archives for different parts of the problem? 

$URL$ says that the node_name option also sets the client_name, but the formatting of the page makes me think that client_name might be a settable option somewhere. Can it be set differently or separately from node_name? 

I don't know of any package to do this, but here's a hacky idea. You could write a small wrapper script for [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\exefile\shell\open\command] that logs the name of the binary being run, then fetch those logs later from each machine? It would only tell you what was launched directly by the user, not from other processes, and wouldn't tell you anything other than when it was run. 

There are IPs on my network that are not configured as fixed or floating in Neutron, they are simply claimed by an instance (e.g. via ). How do I get openstack (possibly via neutron-openvswitch-agent?) to tell me which instance, if any, has claimed a certain IP? Or produce a list of such IPs? 

I've encountered VM templates distributed as an OVF with a feature so that when you boot the VM for the first time you are prompted for configuration options such as hostname, IP address, root password, etc. What is used to do that? Is it specific to a certain virtualization environment, or to a specific client OS, or something else? 

I have a small Python-based server program that runs fine, but I want launched each time the server is rebooted. What is the least that I need to put into an /etc/init.d script to work? I only care about "stop" and "start" (and thus probably the trivial "restart"). 

I need to make a quick-and-dirty NAT out of a Ubuntu 10.10 box. Just "this side is NATted with DHCP handing out 192.168.x.0/24" and "this side gateways to the Internet", and nothing else interesting. There seems to be many choices with varying degrees of documentation. What's the easiest way to do this? 

First-hand recommendation: Rootbsd.net. They are part of a larger Linux hosting house, but their FreeBSD expertise is quite high. I have had a few in-depth conversations with tech support, and always come away impressed. 

When booting into Linux, there are sometimes one or two lines that get quickly cleared. I think that some of them don't even appear in dmesg. If nothing else, I want to suppress the clear before the "login:" prompt. Is there a kernel command or sysctl that I can set to prevent this so I can read them on the console screen after booting? 

Is there a way to get all of BIND's startup messages to go into the log named in the config file? For example, in named.conf, I have: 

I am creating a test system that will be run by others. It will have some kernel mods, and some of the default software in /usr/bin will be replaced. Because of this, I want to prevent the users from doing "sudo apt-get update" or "sudo apt-get install". These systems will not have any valuable data, and will mostly be behind corporate firewalls, and thus it is safe to completely punt on security-based releases. FWIW, moving apt-* and dpkg* to /usr/dontusethese does not work because some other processes like (gag) MOTD updating relies on them being in /usr/bin and whine if they are not there. 

This is a feature/bug of putty, not FreeBSD. putty always tells the other OS what its width and height are. You can show this easily by doing one of your truncating commands, then widen the putty screen. You can see that the lines were truncated. Now give the comand again: you will see more columns. In essence, what you are asking putty to do is to lie about the width of your window (giving a number larger than what it really is showing) and to wrap the longer lines intelligently. That will work fine for and and so on, and fail miserably for or any other full-screen editor. Such lying can also cause display of information that can be misinterpreted because of the wrapping. There may be a mode of putty that does this, but I could not find it. 

We tried copying imagick.so and memcache.so from the old extension directory to 5.6.7's extension directory, but without any luck. How do we install these extensions to our latest version, PHP 5.6.7? Or is there a way to resolve this without reinstalling anything? Edit: To install PHP 5.6.7, I used the steps given in this gist: 

I am trying to build an automated background backup program to backup my entire website and its heavy photo folders, using Amazon's cloud storage service, S3. I am using S3Sync from S3Tools and have successfully tested a dummy backup using only the command line window. When I save the working command line to a batch file (.BAT) and have a Windows schedule call it, it does not work. I can only think this has something to do with the local paths set in the command line. If I go on to my server and open the command prompt from my 'Start' button, the command prompt has a default of: 

To solve this you need to extend the session's idle time. You can do this by going to: Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Terminal Services Configuration : Right Click Connection > Sessions Tab And then altering the idle timer settings to suit your needs. I changed mine to have an idle of 1 day before disconnecting and logging out. 

Working overly tired caused me to use the wrong web.config file in my application, therefore applying a permanent redirect on the wrong URL!! I was meant to convert: 

I have a busy celebrity stock photo website and I am trying to hide the photos behind the website root, so they can't be accessed via URL, but my ASP script can read the photo and sends it to he browser in binary. I'm using Windows Server 2008 R2. I would like to know what security settings should be on the folder that contain the photos. My website is sitting at and the photos need to be stored on the D drive here: . I did manage to get this working by simply clicking 'Share' in the properties of and then giving 'Everyone' read/write permissions but I feel I'm doing something wrong. What should I be doing to make this folder safe, but accessible for the server administrator account and my website scripts? What 'Share' properties should I be applying? Should I be sharing? 

I would like to automate the installation of FreeBSD 8.2 for a project I'm working on. I know the answer to every question in the standard installation, so even a script that just pushes keystrokes would be acceptable. All clues appreciated. FWIW, I tried this question on the FreeBSD fora ($URL$ but only got one response that didn't solve the problem. Maybe ServerFaulters will have more ideas. 

In Ubuntu, I have two ethernet interfaces eth1 and eth3 that I want to call "foo0" and "foo1", respectively. Basically, I want something like "ip link alias DEVICE SECONDNAME". Is there a way to do this without mucking in the kernel? 

I need to set up an ESXi 5.1 box to run some pre-made VMs that will not run well under VMware Workstation. I have started testing this, but cannot figure out where the @#$% the control comes from other than vSphere Client, which runs only on Windows. I get strong hints that, at least under earlier versions of ESXi, you could do most of the necessary things (start and stop VMs, add files to the datastore, configure new VMs, and so on) from a command line. However, VMware's site is now so littered with related products, it is impossible to find whether this low-end scenario is supported. I would imagine that a lot of serverfaulters would rather not have some of their critical infrastucture running on Windows. Let us set up a hypervisor box, and we'll control it from SSH. If there is a guide for how to do this for ESXi 5.1, I'm not finding it. Clues appreciated. 

The "default" category is supposed to get all of the logging that doesn't happen in other categories. However, when I start named, I get a bunch of messages in /var/log/daemon.log, and then more in the named file. I would like them all to go into the named file so I don't have to look two places to figure out what might have gone wrong when starting. 

If you want to expand beyond the Linux distro world yet still stay small-footprint, check out installing FreeBSD. It comes with Sendmail (general ugh, but good enough out of the box) as part of the base install. You didn't say how little your old computer has, but FreeBSD should run just fine on something as little as 64M. 

I'm fairly new to server administration, so please be gentle with me. On my dedicated server, in IIS6 manager, I've just added a new site called "upload-system", and modified the FTP settings so the home directory is \upload-system\www\uploads\, instead of just \upload-system. This is all okay but have one issue: When I connect to the server using an FTP client, for example CuteFTP, I land in my new home directory, \uploads, just like I wanted, but from there, there's nothing stopping me from going back a directory, using the up-level/back button on the FTP client. I'm actually able to go right back to the c: directory on the server. I created this FTP site so my client can FTP his photos there, I really don't want any of their office staff having access to other parts of the server when connecting via FTP. How do I stop this from happening in IIS6 manager? 

As the title reads, I'm about to download and install URL Rewrite Go Live extension on my Windows Server 2008 R2 dedicated server, and I need to find out which version of URL Rewrite I should be downloading, x64 or x86. The information that came with the server when I started to rent it said it was 64-bit but when I look at my C: directory I have two Program Files directories, one titled "Program Files" and the other "Program Files (86)" - so this has confused me somewhat. Can anybody suggest how to find this out? 

I am trying to migrate an old Windows Server 2003 32-bit machine, running MySQL 4.1, to a new Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit machine, running MySQL 5.1, and have just got to the database part. I have quite a heavy DB sitting on the old server, and before I try to download the tables and then re-upload them to the new site, I want to make sure I don't have to do a conversion first? The old server is not running the latest MySQL or PHP so using PhpMyAdmin is out of the question, and I don't have permsission to change anything like that, I just have a rubbish, basic, buggy WebFusion control panel. Any help gratefully appreciated. 

It has nothing to do with Plesk. The problem is with the way SSL and HTTP work. Basically, SSL doesn't know the name of your server before it starts, and so Apache can't pick which set of certs to use. See $URL$ for more detail on this chicken-and-egg problem. 

a) Yes, I have experience with this. b) The answers above about using hashes answer only the question you asked in the title of this thread, not in the body. To prove you had them before you got the CD-ROM, you will need to provide logs of when they were last touched, something you probably don't have because this kind of information is rarely kept. c) Having said that, your company probably does keep backups, and those backups have dates on them, and those backups can have files selectively restored from them for matching. If your company has a written backup policy, and the backups you kept match the policy, this will make it much easier to convince someone that you didn't fake the backups. If you don't have a policy but the backups are clearly marked, that might be sufficient (although the lawyer for the other side will question this up the wazoo). d) If your company didn't keep backups, and all you have is the described screen shots, forget about it. You will have a very hard time convincing anyone that you are in control of your data well enough to "prove" that you had those files first. 

II am working on a project where I need to create a virtual machine that acts like a home gateway, so I am looking for the firewall/NAT that is most flexible. My hope would be that I could give some configurations that would make the VM act like some of the gateways typically installed in homes and small offices. Has anyone tried this before? Which software might be best for this? I can use any OS, so it could be pf, pfSense, iptables, ipfw, ipfilter, or even something more obscure. Any clues are appreciated. 

I have been using RootBSD ($URL$ for years and remain impressed. Low-cost, excellent tech support. Lots of different VPS plans.
