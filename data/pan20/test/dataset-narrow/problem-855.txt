My question is; how can I create a scheduled task via command line, with the trigger “At task creation/modification". 

I am trying to create a script in powershell that request and install an available application for a user or computer in the sccm application catalog. I know that there is a way to force sccm client actions using wmi methods. Example 

I am creating a schedules task to run just before it's created and deleted after it runs. I am using the tool, schtasks to create the scheduled task, but i havent found the parameter to run the task "At task creation/modification" 

I have a growing stock photo website. It's currently hosted on a pretty basic dedicated server from WebFusion and I now need to expand, both storage and performance, and to lose their rubbish support team. We have 500k photos online now and reckon we could make the million or two mark quite soon. I'm now stuck on what options there are for expanding, whether to just upgrade the server we have to hold more files, use a third-party storage service, like Amazon, buy our own server or something else. Any suggestions would be amazing, thanks. 

We have two versions of PHP on our Linux CentOS6 machine, 5.3.3 and 5.6.7, and wanted to install PHP extensions, memcache and imagick, to 5.6.7. Logged in as root, using yum, we installed both of these, but realised they were only usable in 5.3.3 and not in the latest version. This are the commands we used: 

I am requesting a certificate that must be approved by the CA administrator. When I make the request, it appears in the CA pending request folder and I right click to issue the certificate. but the approved certificates don’t appear in the personal folder of the requesting computer. I have tried refreshing the certificates mmc and updating the machine group policies but the certificate does not appear in the client computer. My question what I need to do after issuing a certificate in order make it appear in the certificate vault of the computer. 

I am in a command prompt of winPE and would like to start from there, the installation of windows 8. I have the files of the installation media on the local drive but I dont know what is the file that I need to execute in order to start the windows installation wizard. Whats the file that start all the installation of windows in winPE. 

You can use a properly formatted method on the Chef recipes you run on the web server that return the node object for your DB server. Then you can get the aforementioned IPs via node["ipaddress"] οr, if you need the public IP/hostname when running on EC2, node["cloud"]["public_hostname"]/node["cloud"]["public_ipv4"]. For example, after deploying the DB server use something like: 

The web server update will occur either asynchronously, whenever the Chef client runs or you can force the run by hand via manual or 

What I do is setup a local VM (either via Vagrant or a simple VirtualBox VM) and then setup a complete Chef server installation there. Afterwards, I copy my normal knife.rb to an alternative knife.rb file (like knife.local.rb) where I change the Chef server's URL and upload all my data via 

To solve this you need to extend the session's idle time. You can do this by going to: Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Terminal Services Configuration : Right Click Connection > Sessions Tab And then altering the idle timer settings to suit your needs. I changed mine to have an idle of 1 day before disconnecting and logging out. 

As the title reads, I'm about to download and install URL Rewrite Go Live extension on my Windows Server 2008 R2 dedicated server, and I need to find out which version of URL Rewrite I should be downloading, x64 or x86. The information that came with the server when I started to rent it said it was 64-bit but when I look at my C: directory I have two Program Files directories, one titled "Program Files" and the other "Program Files (86)" - so this has confused me somewhat. Can anybody suggest how to find this out? 

You can use a Microsoft tool called Process Explorer to find the active processes. You can find the process by dragging the target symbol over the windows you want the get the PID. 

There is a way that by executing a wmi method or command line, in the users computer, to force the installation of and application. 

i just have access to a windows server hyper-v VM via RDP and I need to validate if the attached disk are fixed or dynamically expanding disks. There is this information available inside the operating system or just is possible to validate this in the hypervisor vm setting. 

SNI requires both server AND client (web browser + OS) support. For OSes/web browsers not supporting SNI, such as Windows XP or IE6, the browser will be ignoring the SNI SSL header and still request the default SSL certificate of the server which will most probably mismatch with the actual domain you are visiting. To be able to support almost all popular platforms I would suggest obtaining an different IP for each one of the domains you need to supply with SSL support and configure nginx to listen on a separate address for each one of these domains. 

From there, the options to manage your logs are endless: graylog2/logstash, splunk, php-syslog-ng or a number of other solutions (google is your friend!) 

What is the sensible way to get around this? Can I change the default directory on the command prompt processor, when it's first loaded? Or is there a way of changing my batch command code to use the local paths correctly? Maybe this isn't the problem at all and it's something else? Any help greatly appreciated. My command line code: 

We tried copying imagick.so and memcache.so from the old extension directory to 5.6.7's extension directory, but without any luck. How do we install these extensions to our latest version, PHP 5.6.7? Or is there a way to resolve this without reinstalling anything? Edit: To install PHP 5.6.7, I used the steps given in this gist: 

The git action actually triggers notifications if the revision has changed. So add an execute block that runs only on notification, and you're done! 

to get your sqlite extension installed and automatically loaded. Note: Atomic offers a lot of updated packages and PHP there is on the 5.3 version. Bear that in mind if you are running 5.3-incompatible applications. 

Every action is logged in /var/log/chef/server.log. You can start by examining the file and exporting relevant information. You can also try santoku that supports event hooks on knife events and forward these events on a variety of services (hipchat, logstash etc). 

It depends on the user you are using to run Rails. By best practice for security, this should be a different user than www-data (which is the user debian-based systems use for apache/nginx owned files). www-data should only own what you export in your static directory. That said, if the files you are generating are static (such as thumbnails) and you are sourcing rvm from /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh you can try running the following: 

I need to request a certificate via command line I have investigated that certreq is the tool that can request the certificate. I am used to the gui to request the certificate by selecting one of the available templates, but I need to do the same via command line. Any ideas about how to achieve this? 

I have downloaded a media from msdn of windows server 2012 to upgrade a server core to gui, but this media does not have de winsxs folder in the source folder there is just a SXS folder. I have tried to install the feature with this folder as a, path but is not working. My question is what is the difference between the winsxs and the sxs folder and why is this folder missing from the installation media. 

This will run the command as www-data, launch a login bash shell instantaneously (which means /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh gets loaded) which in turn runs rvm with your specified gemset and commands. Remember to host your code outside of the web server's docroot! 

The Atomic repository offers a nice, well thought out, compliant with the standard Redhat naming convention and up-to-date bunch of PHP rpms for both Centos 5 & 6. Their official site is this and installing the repository (not the packages) is as simple as 

You can use to bootstrap any server into a fully provisioned Chef node. It installs the chef-client binary automatically and runs a prespecified runlist. As usual, try for more information. For the steps BEFORE actually bootstrapping the server you can try a number of different applications built specifically for this purpose:
