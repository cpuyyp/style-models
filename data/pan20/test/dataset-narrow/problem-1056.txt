It sounds like TestDisk could solve (or at least diagnose) all of your problems. You will probably need to boot into a live Linux distro to use it though. TestDisk can: 

What I am ideally trying to achieve is a single wireless network in the house, to which all of the family's devices could connect. This unified network would then load balance all of the requests, keeping everything fast for everyone. I found a post detailing how to do basically what I want here but I can't get the VLANing to work. I am currently testing with 2 of the three WANs. On my LAN, the PFSense box is the DHCP server for a network. This is also my WLAN running from the wireless NIC on the PFSense box. The ethernet NIC and each of the WAN routers is plugged into the unmanaged switch. One WAN is on a network where the PFSense box has a static IP of and the WAN router has an IP of . This is assigned to the (ethernet) interface of the PFSense box. The other WAN is on a network where the PFSense box has a static IP of and the WAN router has an IP of . This is assigned to a VLAN interface on the NIC. Both the and routers have been set as gateways for their respective networks and interfaces. However, while the route works fine, I cannot even ping . I can ping the PFSense box on all of its addresses though. I'm sure there is something simple that I am missing, but I can't figure it out. Any ideas? 

The Issue Today, I had tried to log into a web application on my server, when I was greeted by the following error: 

I recently built my own computer, and I was excited to finally put it all together yesterday and get it running. However, I have noticed an annoying issue on my monitor, and I don't know if it's a hardware- or software-oriented problem. There is a random magenta line on the far left of my monitor, right on the border of the screen. It seems that the system either is unable to see the full screen size, or there is another issue at play. Interestingly enough, I do not notice it at the motherboard BIOS screen or the kernel selection screen, but only once my operating system has booted does it appear. My monitor is a Samsung S24D300H 60Hz 24.0" Monitor and I am running Fedora 20 as my operating system. Is there any way I can diagnose where this issue is coming from and how I can fix it? Any help would be appreciated, and if more information is needed, please just ask. 

TestDisk has a really great, easy to use UI (even from the terminal) as well as some great tutorials on their website here. 

My friend has a (nearly full) failing 1 TB Western Digital My Passport. It will only occasionally mount on my MacBook, and refuses outright to mount on my Ubuntu box. I'm trying to use GNU ddrescue 1.19 (on the Ubuntu box) to create an image of the drive onto a 2 TB Western Digital My Passport Ultra. The failing drive is NTFS and the destination drive is formatted to ExFat. Both are connected via USB 3. Even using to skip scraping, I'm averaging a read speed of ~60-70 kB/s. This works out to about half a year to make its way through the full terabyte. Whenever ddrescue starts, generally the first 2 or 3 reads report ~1-2 MB/s or more, but then it immediately, inevitably plummets. I've looked around the internet and found lots of people with similar issues, but no good solutions. I've tried playing around with the sector size, the cluster size, and the kernel cache bypass, but no luck. My is and my is a .dd file on the output disk, which is mounted in /media. What else can I try to speed this thing up? Edit: SMART output: 

Original answer taken from AskFedora Original Comment Please try adding to kernel command line when booting (you should edit Fedora line in GRUB and add it to the end of linux/linux16/linuxefi line in the boot config, and then press F10), and then run when booted. Also, I'd like to know what do you see when you boot Fedora? The Fedora logo which is being filled with white color, or 3 simple bars at the bottom of screen? Update As can be seen in your last output after adding to kernel boot command line, your graphics driver has been loaded and is working successfully. Previously, it did not load at all and you were using a generic driver. However, this is actually a bug. Kernel should have been loading i915 driver automatically. Update 2 Update 2: To change kernel command line permanently, you can: 

Hold control and shift when opening the command prompt. This will open the command prompt as an Administrator (probably after popping up a UAC dialog). Then you should have full rights to do whatever you want with the registry. Be EXTREMELY careful though, because messing with the registry is the quickest way to completely kill a Windows machine. Edit: Thanks to @DavidPostill I realize I should clarify some more. Some registry keys in Windows are set to the group. In Windows, is the level above (i.e. System has even more rights and power than Admin). Running runs whatever options you supplied as . However, only an has the permissions to execute anything as . Psexec will not warn you of this (at least as of the last time I used it); it will just run with whatever the highest privileges it can, which is likely your user account's privileges. Executing psexec with -s from an shell should solve this problem. 

I now realize that there are "caps" to the amount of data that I can hold in each directory. This was how the server was provided to me and by no means was this intentional, as it puts me in a significant quandary with how I manage my data. I was then given the following advice that I should reimage my drive to correct this issue and to avoid data loss. 

Yesterday, my cousin wanted me to install Linux Mint onto his Windows 8 Lenovo laptop so he could dual-boot Linux Mint and Windows 8 so he could get some hands-on experience with Windows 8. I've only ever installed Linux for dual-booting on Windows XP, and I was originally not aware of all the UEFI details for installing Linux on a Windows 8 machine. So, I created the Linux Mint USB stick and put it onto my 4GB flash drive, which I then plugged into the computer. I booted into the BIOS of the computer and changed the USB stick to be the default boot option. I successfully booted from the Mint USB stick, and I opened up Gparted on the USB drive to edit the partitions. The partitions are as follows: 

So I have been trying to set this up for days and cannot get it to work properly. I am trying to replace our home router (a crappy Thomson router provided by our ISP) with a PFSense box repurposed from a laptop with a dead screen. Here is what I have: 

In Windows (I believe XP and above), you can set the default window size by holding the control key and exiting the program. For example, to get MS Word to open your documents in full screen by default: open a document, maximize it, hold ctrl and click the "X" to close it. This will save that window's size and position (be it maximized or any other position and size you have set) and use it as the default for that program. This should also work for any other program that does not implement its own custom size setting parameters (i.e. command prompt). 

Is my gateway the VPN address, such as vpn.example.com? What type of authentication does a default OpenVPN server require? I know in my configuration file, there are multiple keys that seem to be embedded in the file itself. If the authentication is username + certificates (which I believe it is), where can I find my user certificate, CA certificate, and private key? Are those located somewhere on the server or do I need to generate those locally on this machine? Thank you. 

I have installed a few more things across the course of the night, but none of them seemed to have done any good, so I don't think they are relevant. If any more information is needed, please let me know and I will provide. As a reminder, I am very new to Linux in general and I am still learning, so I am not the most familiar with all the different UNIX operations I am able to do. Here's a quick rundown of my system specs: 

If you are using uTorrent, the best way to achieve full speed is to force outgoing encryption. Open up your settings menu ( on a Mac, or I believe on a PC). Select the BitTorrent tab. In the change it to forced. This way everything BitTorrent sends is encrypted, so the ISP can't identify it as torrent traffic. 

That all depends. If by "wireless network" you are referring to an EDGE (2G) or 3G/4G connection then it would be as simple as going in to your iPhone's settings and turning tethering on. However, in the much more likely scenario that you are referring to a Wi-Fi network then the answer is a simple "No" unless you are not afraid of jailbreaking your device. In case you are unaware, jailbreaking an iPhone is a very simple and completely legal operation that removes many of Apple's restrictions and allows the iPhone to run third-party apps. If you have jailbroken your iPhone then there are a number of apps that could do what you are looking for. I recommend MyWi, though I believe that PDANet would work as well. 

Solution ScreenCloud defaulted the name of the file as something using slashes, e.g. , which the Linux server could not handle because the slashes weren't acceptable characters. The solution was manually changing the screenshot name to exclude slashes, and after that point, uploading screenshots worked fine. 

I recently installed ZNC on a Fedora 22 VPS I'm renting for educational purposes to try to strengthen my Linux skills and knowledge. One thing I am trying to do is set up a small IRC bouncer on this VPS using ZNC. I want to use a specific subdomain for all of the ZNC-related parts of my server, but after reading through the documentation, I am still confused about how I would go about binding ZNC to a specific subdomain as compared to the root domain of the server (i.e. znc.example.com versus example.com). How would I go about doing this? I feel like the BindHosts option is related, but I am having difficulty understanding its purpose.
