It seems obvious that languages with finite generating sets are more powerful than context free grammars (the elements of a finite system don't even have to be decidable), but I wasn't able to construct a counter example. However, if $M_L$ itself is finite, $L$ is even regular and the sets of $M_L$ are decidable! I have posted this question on math.stackexchange without any response. 

Let $\Sigma$ be an finite alphabet and $(N, \circ)$ a semigroup. The semigroup operation on $N$ can be extended to $\mathscr{P}(N)$: $N_1 \circ N_2 := \{ \; n_1 \circ n_2 \; | \; n_1 \in N_1, \; n_2 \in N_2 \; \}$ for $N_1, N_2 \subseteq N$. Want to define: 

Is there a context sensitive language $L$ so that $L$ cannot be recognized by a deterministic linear bounded turing machine in $O(n^2)$ steps, but still can be recognized by a deterministic LBA? The existence of $L$ would imply that linear-space-bounded cellular automata are more powerful than linear-time cellular automata: All deterministic CSL's can be recognized by linear-space-bounded cellular automata and linear-time cellular automata can be simulated by LBA's in $O(n^2)$ steps. By using crossing-sequences, it is shown that unbounded LBA's are more powerful than linear-time-bounded LBA's. In particular the context free language $\{ ww^R\: | \: w \in \Sigma^* \}$ cannot be recognized by a turing machine in $O(n)$ steps, but can be recognized in $O(n^2)$ steps. 

Let $M$ be a binary ($0-1$) matrix of size $n \times m$. We define binary rank of $M$ as the smallest positive integer $r$ for which there exists a product decomposition $M = UV$, where $U$ is $n \times r$ and $V$ is $r \times m$, and all entries of $U$ and $V$ come from $\{0, 1\}$. My question is that is there known algorithmic way to determine the binary rank of $M$; and Singular value decomposition that support the binary rank. Any reference in this regard would highly help. 

For $n>1$ and $~0<p \leq 1$, can we upper and lower bound the following binomial series in terms of $n$ and $p$ $$\Sigma_{i=\lceil p n \rceil}^n {n \choose i} (p )^i(1-p)^{(n-i)}$$ 

We have given a set of $n$ binary vectors each of dimension $d$, i.e. a binary matrix of $d*n$. Our goal is to group vectors which are almost similar, $\forall v_i, v_j\in\{0,1\}^d$, we say $v_i$ and $v_j$ are almost similar, if $HammingDistance(v_i,v_j)<\epsilon$. Since comparing two $d$ bit vectors are expensive, and $n$ is large, we can't afford to do $O(n^2)$ comparisons, we use Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithm to computer similarity preserving matrix in subquadratic time. Now, my question is that how to tune parameters of LSH, i.e. # of hash tables $m$, # of entries per hash table $l$, such that error is minimizes (the number of similar items which hashes to different bucket, and the number of dissimilar items which hashes to same bucket is minimizes). Pls let me know if I am missing something obvious. 

Note that when the poset $I$ has no arcs, then we recover the usual constructions (disjoint union and function dominance). In particular I would like to know whether (i) there could exist an axiomatic / category-theoretic definition of these "directed" operations, (ii) there are other examples of structures displaying this property. 

I'm interested in the possibility of fast algorithms for the following two problems on permutations. 1) Given a permutation $\pi$ and an integer $k$, compute a pair $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})$ where $\mathcal{C}$ is a maximum $k$-chain and $\mathcal{A}$ is a corresponding $l$-antichain certifying the optimality of $\mathcal{C}$. If you only care about $\mathcal{C}$, this can be done in $O(k n \log n)$ by an involved algorithm ('Maximum k-Chains in Planar Point Sets: Combinatorial Structure and Algorithms' by S. Felsner and L. Wernisch). It seems possible to obtain a simpler algorithm that would also provide a certificate. 2) Given a permutation $\pi$, compute the pair of Young tableaux $(P,Q)$ associated to $\pi$ by the Robinson-Schensted bijection. Is it possible to do it in subquadratic time? Note: if we only care about the first $k$ rows of each tableau this can be done in $O(k n \log n)$ time in the RAM model; by Greene theorem, the cumulated size of the first $k$ rows gives the cost of an optimum solution for 1), without providing an explicit solution. Thus question 1) seems to require a different approach. 

We have given a weighted graph $G=\{V,E\}$, where $V=\{v_1, v_2,...,v_n\}$, and for all $i,j$, the weight of edges $w(v_i, v_j)\in (0,W)$. And we have also given a weight threshold s $w$ (where $0<w<W$) on the edge as the input. Now, our goal is to find (probabilistically) cliques (of any size >=3) in the graph such that the edges which are in cliques having weight at least $w$, i.e., we need to find cliques having edge weight at least $w$. Pls let me know if I am able to put the question clearly. 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. For a given $\rho \leq |V|$ and $\epsilon$ with $(0<\epsilon<1)$, is there any sublinear query algorithm known/possible to decide if the graph has a clique of size $\rho$, or all the cliques are of size at most $\rho(1-\epsilon)$. More precisely, for a given probability tolerance $\delta$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$, algorithm queries $f(\frac{1}{\epsilon}, \frac{1}{\delta}).o(n^2)$ many position of the corresponding adjacency matrix of the graph, and accept with probability at least $1-\delta$ if the graph has a clique of size $\rho$, or reject probability at least $1-\delta$ if all the cliques are of size at most $\rho(1-\epsilon).$ Thanks in advance. 

We say that $G$ is perfectly Gallai-colored if the polytope $\mathcal{P}(G)$ is integral for every tuple $c$ with integral values. In particular, for two colors it includes graphs for which the clique-packing / independent-packing problems are LP-solvable. Among those are the comparability and co-comparability graphs, as this should follow by the Greene-Kleitman theorem if I'm correct. I have two questions in this respect: (1) Are there existing references to this class in the literature? (2) Is this class closed under the operation of substitution? If true this would imply that a completely decomposable colored graph is perfectly-Gallai colored. This would generalize the fact that a cograph is both comparability and co-comparability. 

By a graded PSG, we mean a pair $(S,r)$ consisting of a PSG $S = (X,*)$ and of a rank function $r : X \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $x*y$ is defined, $r(x*y) = r(x)+r(y)$. This holds for instance for the interval algebra of an Eulerian poset (see On the Foundations of Combinatorial Theory I. Theory of Moebius Functions, by G.C. Rota). By analogy with the situation in posets, we may define a 'triangular matrix' $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^X$ by $\lambda(x) = 1$ for every $x \in X$, and a mapping $\zeta : \mathbb{R}^X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^X$ by $\zeta(x) = \lambda * x$. It is known that for a partial semigroup obtained from the interval algebra of an Eulerian poset, the function $\lambda$ has an inverse $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^X$ given by $\mu([x,y]) = (-1)^{r(y)-r(x)}$. This suggests a possible extension to certain graded PSGs, which leads me to ask the following. Question: for a graded PSG, under what conditions does $\lambda$ have an inverse $\mu$? When this holds, is it always true that $\mu(x) = (-1)^{r(x)}$? (NOTE: I renamed the rank function $r$ instead of $l$ for greater consistency.) 

I am trying to understand the notion of $\epsilon$-coreset and its relation with sampling bounds of a range space having a finite VC-dimension. Although both of them give an $\epsilon$-approximation sketch of the input data. However, for the later case we know a characterization i.e. if a range space has finite VC dimension, then it can be approximated by a small (constant) size sample. On the other hand, for the case of $\epsilon$-coreset (similar to the concept of VC dimension) is there any characterization known over the problems which can or cannot be sketched by a small size sample? Thanks, 

A result of Johnson and Lindenstrauss shows that a set of $n$ points in high dimensional Euclidean space can be mapped into an $O(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon^2})$- dimensional Euclidean space such that the distance between any two points changes by only a factor of $(1\pm \epsilon).$ I am looking for reference for a similar result for Hamming space- i.e. a set of $n$ binary vectors can be mapped into a very low dimensional space such that the hamming distance between any pair of vectors is approximately preserved. 

The time hierarchy theorem states that turing machines can solve more problems if they have (enough) more time. Does it hold in some way if the space is limited asymptotically? How does $\textrm{DTISP}(g(n), O(s(n)))$ relate to $\textrm{DTISP}(f(n), O(s(n)))$ if $\frac{f}{g}$ grows fast enough? I am especially interested in the case that $s(n) = n$, $g(n) = n^3$ and $f(n) = 2^n$. In particular, I considered the following language: $ L_k := \{ (\langle M \rangle, w) \; : \; \text{M rejects } (\langle M \rangle, w) \text{ using at most } |\langle M \rangle, w|^3 \text{ time steps}, $ $ k * |\langle M \rangle, w| \text{ cells and four different tape symbols} \} $ However, $L_k$ could be decided in $n^3$ steps by using $(k+1)n \in O(n)$ space. Without limiting $M$ to four tape symbols and thus allowing to compress $O(n)$ cells into $n$ cells, we get space issues when simulating an $M$ with too many tape symbols. In this case, the language is not in $\text{DSPACE}(O(n))$ anymore. The same happens when setting $k = h(|w|)$ for some $h$ that can be computed fast enough. This question is basically a rephrase of my question here. Edit Summary: Changed $\textrm{DSPACE}(s(n)) \cap \textrm{DTIME}(f(n))$ to $\textrm{DTISP}(f(n), s(n))$, however, I think the intersection is also worth to think about. 

Are there linear-time recognition algorithms for these classes? By the previous remark, an algorithm for class 2 would immediately yield an algorithm for class 1, although I suspect a more direct algorithm to exist in that case. What is the complexity of the subpattern problem for two skew-merged or two vexillary permutations? The subpattern problem is known to be polynomial for separable and 2-increasing permutations, and these classes seem the next to study. 

Consider the following problem. We're given a circuit $C$ with $n$ binary inputs and $n$ binary outputs, computing some boolean function $f_C : \mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2^n$. We assume for simplicity that $C$ only contains binary AND/OR gates, except for the output gates that can be OR gates of unbounded fan-in. We want to ensure that $C$ is 'disruption-resistant' in the sense that modifying a small number of gates does not change the output. Formally, fix an integer $k$ and a circuit $C$. Call a '$k$-disruption' of $C$ a circuit $C'$ obtained from $C$ by modifying $k$ gates, except for output gates. Say that $C$ is '$k$-resistant' if, for any $k$-disruption $C'$ of $C$, it holds that $f_{C'} = f_C$, i.e. the two circuits compute the same function. Consider the function $\chi_k : \mathbb{Z}_2^k \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2^k$ such that $\chi_k(x) = y$ with $y_j = 1 \Leftrightarrow \sum_{i = 1}^{k} x_i \geq j$. Given two tuples $u,v \in \mathbb{Z}_2^k$, say that $v$ is an $l$-perturbation of $u$ if $d_H(u,v) \leq l$. Consider the following question: given $l < k$, can we find a circuit $X_{k,l}$ such that for each $k$-disruption $C$ of $X_{k,l}$, for each $u \in \mathbb{Z}_2^k$, there is an $l$-perturbation $v$ of $u$ such that $f_C(u) = \chi_k(v)$? That is to say, $C$ would count the one-entries of $u$ up to some additive error $l$. Suppose that we can find such a circuit $X_{4k,k}$ for any integer $k$. We can then solve the first problem using replication as follows. Take $4k$ copies $C_1,\ldots,C_{4k}$ of the given circuit $C$, and let gate $g_{i,j}$ be the $j$th output gate of $C_i$. For each $j \in [n]$, insert a copy of the circuit $X_{4k,k}$ with input connected to the gates $g_{1,j},\ldots,g_{4k,j}$, and with output gates labeled by $h_{1,j},\ldots,h_{4k,j}$. Finally, let the output gate for the $i$th bit be an OR of the outputs $h_{2k-1,i},\ldots,h_{4k,i}$. Let $\Gamma$ denote the resulting circuit. It is then easy to see that for any $k$-disruption $C'$ of $\Gamma$, there are at least $3k$ circuits $C_i$ that are not affected. Thus, if we consider a fixed input $x$, for each $i$th output bit the following holds: if the gates $g_{1,i},\ldots,g_{4k,i}$ evaluate to a constant tuple $t$ in $\Gamma$ and to a tuple $t'$ in $C'$, then $t'$ is a $k$-perturbation of $t$, and by definition of the circuit $X_{4k,k}$ it then computes a value $\chi_k(t'')$ with $t''$ a $2k$-perturbation of $t$. As this circuit has $4k$ outputs it follows that taking the OR of the last $2k+1$ values yields the desired result. It it thus desirable to construct a circuit $X_{k,l}$ fullfilling the above requirements. I'm working on it but I welcome ideas or advice you may have. 

Let $G(V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph such that degree of all the vertices in $V_1$ is bounded by some constant (say) $d$. Now, for given two positive integer $l$ and $k$, we wish to decide if there is a vertex cover $A\cup B$ with $|A|\leq l$ and $|B|\leq k$, where $A\subseteq V_1, B \subseteq V_2.$ Now, I have following two questions: 1) What is the complexity of the above problem when both $k$ and $l$ are part of input. (Intuitively, it appears to be hard.) If it is hard, then is there any PTAS known to approximate the problem. 2) What is the complexity of the problem when one of the parameters $k$ or $l$ is constant? Pls let me know if there is any doubt about the problem. 

Carathéodory's theorem says that if a point $x$ of $R^d$ lies in the convex hull of a point set $P$, then there is a subset $P′ \subseteq P$ consisting of $d + 1$ or fewer points such that $x$ can be expressed as a convex combination of $P′$. A recent result by Barman (see paper) shows an approximate version of the above theorem. More precisely, given a set of points $P$ in the $p$-unit ball with norm $p \in [2,\infty)$, then for every point $x$ in the convex hull of $P$ there exists an $\epsilon$-close point $x'$ (under the $p$-norm distance) that can be expressed as a convex combination of $O\left(\frac{p}{\epsilon^2} \right)$ many points of P. Now, my question is that does the above result implies (or have some connection with) some kind of dimensionality reduction for the points in the convex hull of $P$. It seems intuitive to me (however I don't have a formal proof of it) - as for any point $x$ inside the $P$ there is a point (say) $x'$ in a close neighborhood of $x$ which can be written as convex combination of constant many points of $P$, which in some sense dimensionality reduction of $x'$. Pls let me know if I am able put my question clearly. Thanks.
