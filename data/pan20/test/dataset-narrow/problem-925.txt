What I want to do seems incredibly simple, but I am getting nowhere quickly searching and reading about this. I need to list some policy documents on a Sharepoint page on our corporate intranet. This is in web application $URL$ The documents are stored in a folder in a document library in our HR Team Site - that's in $URL$ There seem to be a variety of methods for displaying the content of the folder on pages within the same site collection or site (e.g. Content Query Web Part, List View Web Part, Data View Web Part), but automatically displaying this in a different site collection seems very difficult, without spending a lot of money on a third party web app, or spending many hours writing one myself. Am I missing something here? I thought Sharepoint was about leveraging your content and data across the enterprise. 

NB - you will see more files listed than this! You may see multiple version of the ASA and ASDM files, which is ok, but can cause problems if the config isn't quite right or a file is corrupt. If you don't have the files you expect in place, look at what is there. If there are corresponding versions of ASA and ASDM on there, update the config to use them - this will allow you to access ASDM and you can upgrade via that if necessary. If there are multiple versions, start with the oldest ones first. Useful links 

If the server(s) is virtual, you should be able to do a full server backup containing everything - either by snapshotting then backing up, or some other mechanism. Quite storage hungry, but I think gives you the fastest restore time in a true disaster. If you are using a SAN you may find similar opportunities available for data snapshots that will beat the pants off any "backup" style solution. 

Look at the error messages in TMG relating to internal traffic (172.16.x.x ones are a good place to start). Figure out what hosts those relate to, and whether or not these are appropriate actions for the firewall to take for the traffic on those hosts. Never assume that a firewall comes with appropriate configuration out of the box especially if that firewall is to be deployed internally. I'd also suggest using separate switches for your iSCSI Storage Network, rather than trying to segregate the traffic with VLANs. A lot easier to get your head around, and you really need to get your iSCSI traffic right if you are using it for VM hard drives! 

Investigating a slow VPN connection (Cisco ASA IPSec) to a remote office, I noticed on our firewall a lot of access rule matches: 

A local area network may be split into subnets and/or VLANs divided by routers and even firewalls. If the workstation that can telnet to the SQL server is in the same subnet/VLAN as the SQL server, and the one that doesn't work is in a different network location, then it is possible that it is a routing device that is preventing your traffic. The SQL server may also be preventing access based on network properties of the device trying to access it. There should be someone you can ask, but if you are the system administrator and don't know what is going on, you should be able to make some educated guesses after looking at the network settings (IP address, subnet, gateway) of the machines involved. 

I think Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) will work for you - it uses multicast to allow multiple servers to be accessed by the same IP address. The servers decide between themselves which one will handle a request. It can be configured to be sticky (session affinity). Be aware however, that it only offers redundancy in terms of whether a server is up or down - it can't decide which server in the cluster is under less load. Most documentation out there will discuss IIS and NLB, but it works for RDP and other applications. I have had some issues using this over Dell PowerConnect switches in a high load scenario, and would be inclined to go for a more heavyweight load balancing solution, but I think for your purposes it is the best place to start. It's free with Windows Server. 

Is there something I am missing in the config that I need to fix so spanning-tree will allow traffic through. Should I just disable spanning tree on the port-channel on Switch A and stop worrying about this? 

CentOS and Ubuntu both have fairly good documentation for the newbie server admin, and pretty straightforward update/install mechanisms (yum and apt). CentOS is based on Red Hat, so is good practice in case you end up working for a business using commercial Linux distribution, which would likely be Red Hat, but Ubuntu is also quite popular in the enterprise, and is based on Debian. That isn't to say there is anything wrong with the other distros, and you would learn much from running any of them. But I reckon CentOS or Ubuntu would give the quickest return on the investment of time and effort. 

If the only problem they are reporting is the loss of access to a shared drive, then I doubt it is a network issue - if you say they also can't get to their new email or Facebo^H^H^H^H^H^Hcritical web based applications, then you probably are looking at a network related issue. I would move that 9Gb pst file off the server anyway. It isn't advised to run that way by Microsoft, and it could be that accessing that behemoth is flooding the network connection. 

I have a video website running on a VPS under Apache2 that will soon start doing pay per view. Until it starts generating decent revenue, I don't want to invest in more servers, so to start with I need to provide a good enough service to the customers I get. I also host a couple of other websites, but these aren't expected to use a lot of bandwidth. I know that my major bottleneck is bandwidth - so I think the best thing to do is to prevent access to the video site to new connections once my bandwidth limit gets near. Anyone who is already viewing a movie should not be affected. Any ideas on the best way to achieve this? Update: The bandwidth limitation isn't my allocated bandwidth from the provider but rather the available bandwidth for my VPS through the network card. I found that once I hit about 250 simultaneous downloads things start to deteriorate. Assuming each download is at 1mbps I want to start throttling things once I hit 250mbps - in theory I can get 1000mbps, but it doesn't look like that really works. 

I have a number of Virtual Machines that were created from physical servers. Some of these have (in my opinion) an inappropriate number of processors - for example, we have a web application, accessed internally only, running on a VM with 4 processors allocated. This is the highest specced of our VMs, but there are others I suspect are overspecced. As I understand it, this can result in performance degradation, as the hypervisor waits until 4 processors are free on the host machine when allocating processor time to this VM. It also causes problems when trying to migrate the VM between hosts. Are these fair assumptions? Looking at the server itself, I don't see any reason why it needs 4 processors. It just happens that the physical server it had been installed on had that number of processors. So the question is - what risks are there in reducing the number of processors on this VM? Some details: We are running VMware ESX 3.5 on servers with 8 cores and 20Gb. The VM in the example above has 4 processors allocated and 3Gb RAM. The server OS on the VM is Windows Server 2003 Standard SP2 (not R2).
