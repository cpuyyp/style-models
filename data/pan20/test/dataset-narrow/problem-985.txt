Though homebrew claims that their apache already configured for work with passenger, I'm wondering if there is any way to check it? 

I just stuck and would really appreciate some help. I am trying to create a list of dictionaries with the information about file existence, using a trick with : 

So the second task (the one after debug) creates results with again 6 dictionary items, while what I actually want is a list of 2 dictionaries (one for each private key) something like: 

/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys contains the correct id_rsa.pub key. Luci confirms this too. What can be wrong?

I've set dynamic dns for my home network(which is behind NAT) using www.noip.com. I use ddclient to send updates of my ip, but sometimes it takes a while to update the ip. Anyways it's not the point. I want to find a way to extract the ip from my no-ip account webpage which is behind the basic authentication using a command line. The webpage where I can see my dyn IP after logging into my account is $URL$ What I have so far is this (but it doesn't work): 

I want to start ssh server on port 21 (for one of my local hosts). OS X Yosemite (10.10.4) I've changed /etc/httpd_config by adding: 

So I could later extract these dictionaries from and them into a list of dictionaries with something like: 

The only dependency for ansible is python which is satisfied. What is wrong and how can I fix it? Thank you. 

And this makes sense because any task in a playbook has to be run for each managed host. But because it is a local action, it runs first time as expected creating the key file. Second time the file already exists and ansible gets an error: with . So really it must be run only once (at least in this situation). I could do something like: 

Please help! I've spent 3 days googling and didn't find any solution why the same settings work for root user and don't work for regular user... I'm in dispare... 

I've finally solved the problem. I had another colorshemefile.vim in ~/.vim/plugin/. So moved it to ~/.vim/colors/ and my conditional with started to work as it should work… It probably happens because plugins load after colors. And themes have the same file extensions (.vim) as plugins so vim doesn't make a difference between them… So if there are any colors in the ~/.vim/plugin/ directory then they have a "priority" 

I have Macpro (late 2013, Yosemite 10.10.4) and Macbookpro (mid 2010, Yosemite 10.10.4) connected to home network via Wi-Fi (using router Actiontech T1200H) I'm able to ssh both ways without any problems (). But when I try telneting: 

I've restarted dnsmasq multiple times, but old IP addresses of all devices did not change... What am I doing wriong? EDIT: after I logged in to my router and go to WAN Settings I've found this options: 

This never happened to me with openvpn servers.. Any ideas what causes this issue with certificates?

Well I've added gem to the Gemfile but it didn't help. People on github say that original snorby isn't working with postgresql... Some say there are a few forks which are kinda postgres-compatible, but I didn't find them ((((

Could anyone explain what kind of information can ISP see about the DNS queries when DNSCrypt proxy is used on my router, configured with some Public DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers (not the ISP's DNS resolvers). I am aware that DNSCrypt is designed mainly for Client-to-Resolver DNS validation (while DNSSEC is another technology that provides AuthoritativeDNSserver-to-Resolver validation). However DNSCrypt also provides Encryption of DNS queries. In this case can ISP see the contents of DNS query when DNSCrypt is used? Or does it see only the fact of DNS traffic going from my public IP to the IP of DNSCrypt-enabled Public Resolver, but not what site I query? 

For some reason tmux didn't reload the ~/.tmux.conf when doing just and again. So I addressed this issue with . After starting new tmux session all worked properly 

And the same for port 7. I'm trying to wake up my MacBookPro 15" Mid 2010 (laptop connected to power adaptor and the built-in display is open) sending pakets from macpro with this command: 

Well, finally I've figured this out. The problem was complex. 1 - I had the following redirect rules which I was not aware of:

Should be something like in this post (scroll down):$URL$ So I assume passenger doesn't work with apache properly and doesn't start the application(correct me if I'm wrong). What am I doing wrong? gives me this(nothing with "passenger"): 

Getting the following Outlook issue this morning. Clicked to open Outlook this morning and got the following Error: 

I've recently purchased the Synology NAS 215j and having problems with SSH. Root user works as expected I've added my public key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys... Problems with non-root user: sshd always asking the password and seems to ignore the key... When I want to use public key authentication only I get I've checked the permissions of user's home dir: 

Actually the solution was extremely easy - the .mpkg file looks like a simple driectory when you look at it throug the shell, so just inside find your .pkg and do with it whatever you want... for example: 

So I've contacted the Synology Support and they told me that this is going to be changed in DSMv6. And finally it was! 

Sorry for being such a newbie but is it possible to make rails driven app (Snorby) being started on port different than 3000? How to do this? I've changed the ports from to at snorby_config.yml but it still running port 3000... 

In this case our will have 2 ip addresses but of course it will act as a dhcp only with range 172.16.42.0/24 

Is it possible in ansible to make task being run ONLY once while running playbook against a group of hosts? Here is the problem: 

I've got two macs connected to home wireless network via Actiontec T1200H Router.

How can I group each 3 dictionary in 1 dictionary in automated way. Is it possible at all? Or what is the correct way to achieve this? 

PF question on OS X Yosemite 10.10.4: I know that disables all filtering (nat and redirects) on lo0, but what if I need to save the httpd port forwarding rules on this interface while disabling all other filterings: 

I've just started to learn git and wondering if there is a good way to use git for recovering homebrew and all formulas after the complete reinsallation (instead of installing homebrew and all formulas from scratch on the fresh osx) ... Is it a good idea to create a repo for /usr/local before the reinstallation of os x and then recover it from git? Does anyone have a recipe for this? Thank you! 

Any ideas why could it happen? I know that overwrites all environment variables, but don't think it may be an issue. Env vars: 

I am not sure, maybe I can create two bridges somehow... Please give me some advices... I know I should be able to achieve this somehow... Thank you. EDIT: Seems like the is a very special bridge. Although I have with static IP 192.168.2.1, I still can not find a way to share internet on this interface without adding it to by checking it in Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing However, when I add to Internet Sharing (technically to ), the only accessible ip is 172.16.42.1 - address of bridge which is set in , ignoring the GUI settings for Ethernet 1 (): 

After restoring configuration backup using Luci web interface, the ssh public key authentication stopped working: 

So I commented them because apt-get uses port 80 (and probably 443) 2 - Main thing. When ticking Internet Sharing checkbox in Preferences, MacOS dynamically adds the following pf anchors: 

Run to make sure that those anchors are included. If not, then just untick and then tick again Internet Sharing checkbox in MacOS system Preferences. 

Finally the guy from Homebrew project on github pointed me in the right direction. For some reason my /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4/httpd.conf which was created with Homebrew httpd24 installation doesn't have this line: (though homebrew claims they should have it - I think it was relatively recent change) That's why my didn't have passenger module included when checking . (for example: In default /etc/apache2/httpd.conf there is ) So I've added to my my /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4/httpd.conf and it works. 

I am writing the role which includes some tasks to be executed on local machine using statements. When gathering facts, ansible registers some variables about the remote host (e.g. or etc.) How could I detect local (not a remote) OS/OS family? Can it be achieved with facts gathering? Or is there any other proper way of doing it? 

Client - Android Strongswan.app. Also testing with Macbook, tethered to the hotspot on the same Android device. CONFIG Certs and keys are in place:

But this is obviously wrong. The problem is that after the first task contains 6 items - one for each file:
