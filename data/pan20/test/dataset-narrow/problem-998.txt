Sorry, nope, no fix. It's "by-design". If the delete dialog cannot determine the physical location of the file, the permanent delete dialog is shown instead. With a symlink, the physical location of the file is "indeterminate" at best... so no-chance for the move-to-recycle bin option. 

In short, no... you don't need IP addresses to connect machines in the same network. There are several examples of protocols like this like: IPX or Banyan protocols. The problem with using hardware-addresses is best described like this: Imagine for a moment that computers are people in a room... (everyone is glued to 1 spot and can't move around) If Bob wants to talk to Suzy... he shouts out "Hey Suzy"... and Suzy responds... and a conversation ensues. Great right? Sure... on a small scale this works quite well and is actually used regularly in some networking protocols between two (or a few) devices. (Many high I/O protocols use non protocols because they're much "simpler" and finely tuned for the task.) The Internet (as we know it today) is not just 2... or a few people talking directly to each other. The internet is literally BILLIONS of devices. If they were all placed into the same "room" (network-segment)... Imagine what would happen if Bob wanted to talk to Suzy. Bob would yell "Hey Suzy!"... and Bob's voice would be lost in the crowd. (Building a room to fit BILLIONS of people is equally ridiculous.) For this reason, networks are into "smaller rooms" which allow people who are in the same (room) to talk directly to each others, but people outside the room you need some sort of to pass messages from one room to the next room. But the vast number of rooms means you need some sort of addressing scheme so the various in the middle know how to get a message from Bob to Suzy. With the IP protocol, they assign a to each "room", and the routers are told how to pass a message from one room to the next. For example, if Bob's address is 1.1.1.1, and Suzy's address 2.2.2.2, and Bob's is 1.1.1.0/24 (meaning the first 3 bytes of his address must match for it to be in his room), Bob needs to pass his message to the so it can be passed along to Suzy's "room*. Bob knows his is 1.1.1.2, so he passes the message to the , and the router passes it along to other routers in the middle until the message is passed to Suzy's router at 2.2.2.1, which hands the message directly to Suzy... and Suzy can send the reply back to Bob in the same way. Computers in the same actually do communicate directly with each other using the MAC address. It actually starts by sending out an request (ARP = Address Resolution Protocol) which means it shouts out "Who has the address X.X.X.X?"... and whoever has that address replies and from that point on, they continue to talk to each other directly. (I can continue this analogy and explain a great deal more of how the Internet works if you're really interested.) 

I believe this is intentional behaviour of the implementation of these headphones. The idea is that music audio is pushed through the 'speakers', and voice audio is pushed through the 'headset'. As soon as the 'headset' or 'mic' becomes active the device assumes that there is a voice call and makes a (questionably reasonable decision to) mute the music channel. I guess this workflow is most appropriate for car/handheld devices but I use this headset on my PC where I'd prefer to have better quality voice audio (my VOIP client will allow me to pump audio through the speakers, and it is noticeably better sounding than headset). But such is life. Curious if this is the norm for bluetooth headphones with multi source? This is my first pair. 

I plug in an external monitor. I notice my colours are all washed out/high gamma Open the NVIDIA Control Panel In the "Choose how color is set", I change the radio button to 'Use NVIDIA settings'. Then I change it back to 'Other applications control color settings". Note that at no time do I actually CHANGE any settings. At this point the gamma is fixed. I can additionally hit 'restore defaults' or 'apply' to no effect (in the future). 

Since Windows XP or before, you are able to force delete a file by holding down shift while pressing delete. For some time now I've noticed if you select a LARGE number of files (e.g. 20k) or so, shift-delete does not force delete - instead it presents the option to send to recycle bin in the same way as if you had just pressed delete. In trying to consistently reproduce this error I have found that it is not based on a pure threshold. Sometimes I am able to properly shift delete 10k files, sometimes it prompts me to recycle 5k. It makes me suspect that something asynchronous is going on in the background but I can't really speculate as to what. The short and sweet of it is, is there a way I can consistently shift-delete a large number of files? Running W7 64-bit for what it's worth. I think i experienced this in XP as well but can't say for certain. 

This is has a much larger answer than you may expect, filled with a lot of variable pieces. First, you need to consider the level of knowledge of your "user". If a highly-advanced user (or hacker) can sit at the computer... there is very little s/he can't do. A tech-savvy-user may know how to access shares directly, but probably can't do much more when presented with a basic "access denied" message. A typical user won't know how to access a network share unless there is a shortcut for them. What you mean by "network shares"? Are you talking about an actual "Windows Network Share"on a separate Windows Server? If so, just set permissions to allow/restrict users as you see fit. As a general rule, if a user does not have permissions on a network share, he can't access them. Browsing to \some-server\share will result in a friendly logon prompt requiring a username/password (if he is not logged into a domain) or simply an "Access Denied" message (if he is logged into a domain and does not have permissions). Permissions could be assigned to the administrator to give him whatever he needs. As far as "hiding it" goes... this goes back to the level of skill the user has. You can't filter network connections by user, only by IP address, port, or other "network" attribute. Once the network connection is established, then you're at the mercy of the application-layer to maintain security. Unfortunately, there is no way to apply a group-policy object on firewall rules per-user. If you want to restrict the "appearance" of network-shares, you can do quite a bit with group-policies that can obscure or limit the view of various network shares... but this discussion can get quite lengthy and really should not be done lightly. If you're talking about a Network-Share on a "home-grade" appliance (router? nas? ???) with a partially-implemented SMB stack, you're really at the mercy of the manufacturer. If it doesn't ask for a user/password, there's not much you can do. If you're talking about something else... we need more information. 

I have a W540 laptop which uses an optimus setup (NVIDIA K2100M and Intel HD Graphics Family (I would like to once again applaud Intel in coming up with such an obscured/generic name for their video adapter) A few weeks ago while I was connected a projector (via a mini-displayport to d-sub adapter, as the inherent d-sub in my laptop did not appear to work), I attempted to adjust the gamma on the NVIDIA Control panel to compensate for the poor quality of the projector. Unfortunately now, every time I plug/unplug an external monitor, the gamma (and possibly other display settings) change to show a washed out colour! So I have to manually reset it in the NVIDIA Control Panel. I'm guessing this is some sort of mixup between the NVIDIA settings, the Intel Settings, and whatever the hell Windows 7 has as inbuilt settings. But I can't figure out where this is. The other odd thing is I do not actually CHANGE any settings. I simply have to switch between the settings for them to be reset back to the defaults. An example of what happens: 

My work place has a bunch of Razer mice. Every now and again when I plug in my a razor mouse to my Windows 10 machine I get a malware screen from Razer prompting me to install Razer Synapse software. Despite having a prompt to 'Never Install', it continues to prompt me to install it occasionally. $URL$ The things that can bring up the prompt again include: 

I have a laptop with the following devices (image doctored; I digitally stitched the bottom on to show all devices) at work: 

I have a Philips SHB8850NC bluetooth headset. When I'm playing audio through this device, if I click on the 'recording' tab, the audio mutes. As soon as I change the tab back again, the audio resumes. There is a slight static click when I switch the tab. I'm not sure what this means, but thought it was worth noting as it is audibly different from performing a software mute button on e.g. my keyboard (which mutes/unmutes without static click). I also noticed that occasionally while communicating over via headset plugged into the 3.5mm audio jack of my laptop, people would complained about my voice being extremely soft. When I clicked on the recording tab, it would fix the volume until I changed tabs. What is going on here? Is this intentional design (and if so what is the rationale)? Is there a way to prevent it? I am frequently fiddling with my microphone settings because of the above and it would be nice to be able to do so without muting my audio. 

Display port is sort of a multi-purpose port... you can use an adapter to convert it to a DVI port quite easily. Keep in mind, as it's a mac, it's more likely that it's a mini-display port... not the full-sized port... but there are still adapters. It should work fine as long as you get the correct adapter. Alternatively, HDMI ports are becoming more common as a 3rd port on many video cards... which also have an adapter to convert to DVI. 

then press to paste the text... to write it. then do a to close that temporary file & go back to the file you were working on... Now, on the other terminal, simply go to the spot in the file you want to paste into (not in edit mode)... and do a to read the contents of that file into your current document. When you're all done... make sure to delete the temp file. 

right-click and click Modify… and make sure the value is At this point, close the Registry Editor and restart your PC. You should be able to run exe files again after all that. It is likely , , or other executable files have been modified, and will present similar problems as time goes on. IMHO, this is a horrible duct-tape patch... to fix the problem correctly, backup important data, perform a full disk-scan (for bad sectors using a diagnostic disk from drive manufacturer) and look for bad-sectors... and if you find bad-sectors... toss the drive & get a new one... and if not... wipe/reload windows from scratch. If the virus is REALLY new, and you're REALLY unlucky, this may not get rid of some of the latest viruses... as they've figured out how to rewrite some drives` internal firmware, which has the possibility to restore the virus even when the drive is formatted or overwritten even before an OS is installed.
