entry width note depend only on the width of IPs but also on the lookup mechanism used to find specific entry and the compression mechanism used to compress those information in one table entry , an examble for TCAM entry produced by multi access list entries 

Prefer the lowest Root Path Cost. In case of the same Root Path Cost, prefer the lowest Bridge ID of the designated switch (the neighbor that sends BPDUs). In case of receiving BPDUs on multiple ports from the same designated switch (BPDU sender), prefer the lowest Port ID (known also as port priority) of the sender. That parameter has a default value 128 and is configurable. In case of all above are did not resolve the problem, prefer the lowest Port ID of the BPDU sender. 

the port you are specking about called controller and for 30 it will be E1 . its format will be something like E1 0/0/0 . so by issue sh controllers E1 you will get some thing like E1 0/0/0 is up. [Omitted] E1 0/0/1 is down. [Omitted] the UP one is the CONNECTED one to check the status of the ISDN ,issue the command sh isdn status Global ISDN Switchtype = primary-net5 ISDN Serial0/0/0:15 interface dsl 0, interface ISDN Switchtype = primary-net5 Layer 1 Status: ACTIVE Layer 2 Status: TEI = 0, Ces = 1, SAPI = 0, State = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED Layer 3 Status: 0 Active Layer 3 Call(s) Active dsl 0 CCBs = 0 The Free Channel Mask: 0xFFFF7FFF Number of L2 Discards = 0, L2 Session ID = 6 Total Allocated ISDN CCBs = 0 the most importunate here ,the status of layer 1 which active indicating that connection is establish and every thing going well 

After reviewing your configuration it appears that you applied login local only the VTY lines and not the console port. Since you no longer have access to the device you will need to initate a password recovery for the device following the instructions listed here. This will allow you to log into the device and make changes. You will then need to add the following configurations: line con 0 login local Once that has been added you should be able to login via the console port using a locally created account. Two more small pieces of advice: 

In my experience with Cisco devices if it knows that the first gateway is unreachable (which it appears to know since it doesn't have the U flag), then it will move to the next entry on the list that provides the best match for the destination which is the quad zero. ***The routing table says that anything destined for 77.121.128.0/18 will be sent to 73.0.45.1. Packets destined for all other IP address will follow the quad zero rule; that is they will be sent to 73.0.65.1. As such any packets destined for 177.121.128.2 will be sent to 73.0.65.1; in accordance with the rules in the routing table.*** 

They allow us to identify the manufacturer of an item. They provide an unchanging (essentially) identification for an item. It allows for less hardware intensive packet transfer in LANs. 

Yes, your ASA can act as a DHCP server, but the thing to remember is that this is not the primary purpose of the ASA and as such it doesn't perform it as well as a dedicated DHCP server. It can perform it well enough for your clients though. I am uncertain about the VOIPs as the documentation deals specifically with Cisco VOIPs. This link is Cisco's guide to configuring DHCP on the 5500 ASA. Personally speaking, I am not overly fond of how you are describing your new network. Typically I like to recommend that all of your devices connect to a switch and then that switch connect to your router (which I imagine is your edge router.) 

also it can generate health report for all devices include the CPU usage and temperature and FAN speed

to be aware of the whole image this topic is technical speaking about logical items accomplish certain tasks not existed devices , where bridge is the device which has two ports , those two ports will share the same collision domain and the repeaters are the devices which detect certain signal (which suffered from some degradation) and amplify it and send it again . now a days the existing device are the switches which is multi port bridge (share the same broadcast domain on the base of VLANs) and when you read any configuration guide of any product some time you can see its describe the switch as abridge .repeaters are existing only on the wireless setup (actually it is Access point configured as repeater) where it can spread the coverage on a far location than which the access point is setup. 

i'm asking about if there is any link aggregation method on the router side (some thing like L3 port aggregation on switches ) NOTE my routers plateform is 2921 and run Version 15.2(4)M6a 

there is no problem to add any entry to same exiting Object Group ,it won't remove any existing entry Cisco ASA 5500 Series Configuration Guide by the way ASDM will be batter in such firewall configuration and will give you better visibility. 

The abstract of Traceroute probe method and forward IP path inference supports my intuition that ICMP probes will more often succeed in reaching the destination. Allowing different probe methods seems like a great idea, but defaulting to something other than ICMP seems like a bad idea. Could somebody describe the rationale behind why it is better to use UDP by default? 

R2 is a Cisco router, and Cisco routers perform proxy ARP by default. This is the (mis-)configuration in production that set the stage for what turned out to be an ARP cache overflow. 

R1 receives a packet destined for the 10.1.0.0/16 network. On the basis of the static interface route, R1 ARPs for the destination on R2 recognizes that it can reach the destination, and responds to the ARP with its own MAC. R1 caches the ARP result that combines an IP in a remote network with the MAC of R2. 

I was recently troubleshooting a network connectivity meta-problem, in that I knew a given destination was reachable, but I was not able to demonstrate that with because the path went cold after a certain number of hops. Given that the last observed hop was just upstream from the node of interest, I sniffed the traffic, expecting to confirm that the probes were reaching it and to learn which filter rule was blocking them. Sure enough, I learned that the probes were UDP datagrams destined for a high (and varying) port that I had, of course, blocked to inbound traffic. This surprises me, because I assumed that all probes would default to ICMP, since the responses are ICMP. I did a documentation survey and found that different implementations make different choices, and some do not allow the user to make a non-default selection. 

Short answer: Yes. Either works, it just requires that everyone in your organization know what is what. Some places will use how it is programmed for a logical topology and what it actually is in the physical topology. 

Not so far as I am aware. All it does is simulate sending data and seeing which interface would actually be carrying the packets. Granted this is to the best of my knowledge and I might be incorrect. 

Yes it is possible via MAC spoofing. If you are seeing the same MAC address on multiple ports then it is possible that someone is in your network doing some not nice things. 

If you only have one VLAN traversing the link then you should follow best practices and use switchport mode access. Allowing VLAN 1 and 1002-1005 across the trunk provides a potential security issue as VLAN 1 carries a lot of system data for Cisco. Not to mention that all traffice coming from the other end (assuming the other end is a server or client) will not belong to a VLAN and that can cause further issues. I try to stick to a more restrictive strategy. If I don't need for multiple VLANs to traverse a link, I always set it up as an access port. 

Don't use Cisco as your username. Always create a unique username for your organization. This adds a small layer of obscurity to your security posture. Don't forget to perform a copy run start after you apply login local to your console port. You don't want to reboot later on and realize that you can no longer console in. 

IP addresses are like your hair cut. It typically doesn't change often, but when it does you can be completely unrecognizable. The MAC address is like your fingerprint. You may not look the same, but your fingerprint never changes. MAC addresses allow us to do several things. 

In at least one implementation there is a hard limit on the capacity of the ARP table. What happens when the ARP cache is full and a packet is offered with a destination (or next-hop) that isn't cached? What happens under the hood, and what is the effect on the service quality? For example, Brocade NetIron XMR and Brocade MLX routers have a configurable system maximum. The default value in that case is 8192; the size of a /19 subnet. It is not clear from the documentation whether this is per interface or for the whole router, but for the purpose of this question, we can assume it is per interface. Few networkers would configure a /19 subnet on an interface on purpose, but that isn't what happened. We were migrating a core router from a Cisco model to a Brocade. One of the many differences between Cisco and Brocade is that Cisco accepts static routes that are defined with both an outbound interface and a next-hop address, but Brocade insists on one or the other. We dropped the next-hop address and kept the interface. Later, we learned the error of our ways, and changed from interface to next-hop address, but everything seemed to be working initially. 

This happens for every distinct destination in 10.1.0.0/16. Consequently, even though the /16 is properly sub-netted beyond R2, and there are only two nodes on the link adjoining R1 and R2, R1 suffers ARP cache overload because it induces R2 to behave as if all 65k addresses are directly connected. The reason I'm asking this question is because I hope it will help me make sense of the network service trouble reports (days later) that led us, eventually, to the overflowing ARP cache. In the spirit of the StackExchange model, I tried to distill that to what I believe is a crisp, specific question that can be answered objectively. EDIT 1 To be clear, I am asking about part of the glue layer between data link (layer 2) and network (layer 3), not the MAC forwarding table within the data link layer. A host or router builds the former to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, while a switch builds the latter to map MAC addresses to ports. EDIT 2 While I appreciate the effort to which responders have gone to explain why some implementations are not subject to ARP cache overflow, I feel that it is important for this question to address those that are. The question is "what happens when", not "is vendor X susceptible to". I've done my part now by describing a concrete example. EDIT 3 Another question this is not is "how do I prevent the ARP cache from overflowing?"
