I have a Windows 10 machine updated with the Anniversary update. When I try to copy a file from an external USB hard drive using windows explorer, I get the following Error : Destination Path Too Long The file name(s) would be too long for the destination folder. You can shorten the file name and try again, or try a location that has a shorter path. I found an article to enable long file names using the local group policy editor : $URL$ However, this doesn't work for me. I do not see the option to enable. SO, I manually edit the registry setting by adding the key and value. Even after several reboots, this didn't allow the file to be copied. The computer is part of a domain so I searched for the flag in the domain group policy editor but it is not listed. The domain server is Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard. Is there anything else I can do to get the file copied (in reality there are thousands of files I am trying to copy from an external hard drive to a Windows Surface Book). 

I have installed the driver for a FTDI 232R board similar to this one... $URL$ ... and installed the driver for the FT232R chip found here ... $URL$ ... and am trying to hook a ESP8266 to the FT232RL board. The ESP8266 I purchased form amazon and can be found here... $URL$ When the FT232 is connected to USB, Windows sees the board just fine and displays a COM port for me to send command via putty or other terminal program. When I type, I see the light flicker on the FT232 board so it's getting my key strokes. However, if I connect the ESP8266, the COM port disappears from the System Devices in Windows. How can I force the COM port to stay when the ESP8266 is connected to the FT232 serial board? Thanks in advance. 

I can communicate with my ESP8266 via the FTDI board now. After burning another firmware that I knew defaulted to 9600 baud, I followed the advice I found at $URL$ and $URL$ and stuck the 470uf cap on the breadboard between the VCC and Ground rail and stuck .1uf cap from VCC to Ground on the esp8266 board. I can issue AT commands using Putty. I was getting errors issuing AT commmands and then Ctrl-J and Ctrl-M, but if I do commands and Ctrl-M and Ctrl-J I get the "OK" messages. Also, I have to type do a slow Ctrl-M and Ctrl-J or I may get an error. Hope this helps folks in the future. UPDATE - Started getting the issue again. Swapped USB cable, works fine. There was a lot of inconsistent behavior until I swapped the USB cable. I noticed the wire going into the USB connector is exposed. Obviously the cable is hokey. For future adventures with a similar situation, try another USB cable! 

Does she have Word Perfect Mode enabled? Is there a WPM indicator in the bottom of the window that looks like it is enabled? Double click it to disable. 

As one of the other answers mentioned, the colon is used to designate an alternate data stream. Somehow, the ADS got saved as it's own file rather than an ADS attached to Thumbs.db. The colon isn't a legal character in a file name, but using the prefix tells the file sytem, "No, really. I mean a file with a colon in the name." It works on extra long file names, and trailing spaces, and other weird file names. 

The Storage Manager will show the SMART status of each disk. Log into the web interface and go to Main Menu > Storage Manager > HDD Management. 

If you want the heading to always start a new page, edit the Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles. Open the Paragraph Format Window: 

When you choose to Open a file rather than Save it, firefox saves the file in your temp directory. On Windows, you can press +R and then type to open your temp directory. 

I'm guessing that the Windows XP setup program doesn't recognize the HD controller. Is the bios set to use AHCI mode? (Disable AHCI) Is it a RAID type controller? If that is the case, you will need to supply a driver. You can use a floppy disk, and press F6 at the prompt, or create a setup cd with the driver included. (Commonly refered to as Slipstreaming) Or, you can install a modern operating system. Windows 7, Windows 8, or a current Linux distribution are more likely to support your hardware by default.

Have you considered using LaTeX? The other answers suggest using Pandoc, which looks like it can convert Markdown to LaTeX, but it might be easier to start right in LaTeX. LaTeX is designed for the creation of print documents, and has things like page numbers and TOC generation built-in. Check out this basic tutorial: $URL$ 

There really isn't too much you can do. Firstly, I would surf Firefox in privacy mode (assuming you have a FF installed that will support this). If that wasn't possible, try using a portable firefox on a USB stick or some such. I would also agree to using Truecrypt. You can create a file container with it and use that as a small portable filesystem. Those are the two best things you can do since the biggest reasons you would have to use a computer in a lab (w/o admin rights) is as a student. I'm assuming your use case is projects and surfing the Internet. You can store any projects that you're working on in Truecrypt and it will only be available to theft (at least easily) and such while you have it open and are working on it. The only way to escape someone stealing online credentials would be use either a portable web browser in an exncrypted Truecrypt container or use a web browser that doesn't save credentials, cookies, history, etc. Other than that, without being an admin you are extremely limited in options. On top of the above, use safe habits, assume the admin has access to any/all of your files whenever he pleases, and assume your network traffic is always being monitored. EDIT: This has some useful information for you on the Truecrypt end. It's a thread where someone has the same issue as you. One person in there recommended running things from a USB device that has HW encryption to avoid any privilege issues. 

You have to explicitly set the encoding to UTF-8 in your iTerm session. Instructions and helpful thread. I used to have to do this on old version, I'm not sure if it's default in the newer ones as I haven't used it in some time. EDIT: I also found this that may be of some help to you. 

It simply means your local address. When you test your NIC, this can be done via "ping 127.0.0.1". When you do this you are testing to make sure that your information can go down to layer 1 and back up. If you suspect that your NIC is not working on a physical level, this makes a very good test. It can also be used to specify to your applications that you do not want your information to leave the host computer. This can be seen when you have a server-client model application installed on the local computer, but you do not want that information to be accessible remotely. You can specify the server software to transfer information via the loopback address and your client software could listen in on the loop back address. This would provide the information to local applications, while disabling the ability for somebody else on a LAN to access whatever server software you set up as local. I don't know if I explained it very well, but it was the best I could do. The Wikipedia Page has good information on it. 

Running again is creating a new machine from the box (template). Deleting the box would cause to fail. 

Microsoft offered a program called Windows SteadyState. SteadyState was discontinued, but they did publish a TechNet Article on how to implement some of the same features. There are also commercial applications, such as Deep Freeze. You could also run Windows in a virtual machine, and use snapshots to roll back to a known good state. 

It sounds like you are using a version of puppet older than 4.0, and not using the 'future' parser. Data types were added with the new version of the puppet language. You have 3 options: 

You could use a password protected ZIP file and send that over Dropbox. I don't know if that is secure enough for your needs, but is simple. I think your proposed sneakernet option might be the easiest. Send a DVD in the mail. 

It's possible that there is nothing wrong with her PC. When a spam message goes out, they can set the From address to anything they want and the bouncebacks will be sent to your user. This is sometimes known as Backscatter Spam. That said, she should change her passwords on both the Exchange account and the Gmail account. 

Someone might steal your hard drive, so run your PC from a live-CD, and remove all persistent storage except for your Thumb Drive that contains the sensitive data. Physically secure the Thumb Drive. They can still use advanced techniques to read your RAM after the PC is powered off, so rig your PC to be destroyed with thermite in case of emergency. 

It looks like Adobe Reader XI (Adobe Help) has a custom scale option. You may need to upgrade to a new version of the reader. Edit: Yep, here it is: 

You need the Ceiling function. For example, =CEILING(A1, 10) will round the value in A1 up to the nearest multiple of 10. 

I think you might be thinking too narrowly when you ask for a media player solution. Why not something system wide? I haven't had a chance to try anything yet, but osd_cat (Included in libXosd) or libnotify might work.
