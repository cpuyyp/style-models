In other words, to both optimise file size and video quality by removing the damage done by MPEG-2. The ffmpeg option saved a little file size, but not much. Also, decreasing general video quality just introduces "new" compression damages on top of the old ones. 

An Ubuntu application in VirtualBox under OS X says incoming TCP connections are not working. My VirtualBox network settings (NAT). 

When I turn on the machine with the drive in place, will my OS boot and work exactly like before? Does Linux, macOS or Windows have crucial information not covered by file-by-file backup, eg. 

Some times, the terminal still thinks it's connected to the remote host and the cursor is inanimate. How can I end the remote connection and regain control over my parent shell? Pressing Ctrl+C does nothing. 

I have an video recording where the audio part consists of people speaking and various ambient noise, where I would like to remove some of the spoken parts. I am not a sound engineer pro, but I thought the simple and best approach would be to overwrite the spoken parts with ambient noise from another part of the video with some trial and error. However Audacity does not have any way to "overwrite" one audio segment with another without having to mark the two segments byte-perfect by hand while copying, which seems very hard. The audio would thus most likely become out of sync with the video when I join them together after finishing the audio work. Moreover, this seems like an unsafe and wrong way to work. At any rate, how can I achieve my goal of removing the spoken parts, using Audacity or any other non-commercial software (I'm on a Mac)? 

I received a (legitimate!) email from a service provider, which after a initial message, contained a lot of "upn" links that were shown "as-is" in my mail client, looking like a complete, amateurish mess. [ LINK: $URL$ ] Is this a special type of link that is supposed to be hidden or reformatted by the email client? It seems, not surprisingly, this is Microsoft-related. The mail header says . Update: Investigation shows the part of the email contains formatted content with the same links. So it's just the provider's mail generator that does a useless job with the part, and nothing that a (plain text) email client is expected to make sense of, I assume? 

Let's say I have a fresh install of a Unix variant (Ubuntu, for instance), then I install different packages and edit some config files (php.ini, nginx.conf, etc.). Now say I want to revert Ubuntu to the state it was when it was freshly installed. How can I achieve this? (The reason I want to do this is to practice and experiment setting up Unix installations, so it's important that the starting point is the same every time.) Is it as simple as just uninstalling all "apt" packages and keeping copies of the originals of all config files I plan to edit? Or does software installation leave behind files or change settings that are not reverted? 

On a Unix system, what is the best practice for editing system files such as and as non-root without doing the tedious sudo+password? Can I simply those files to my non-root-user, or is there a better way using groups or something? 

I run Gmail in "Basic HTML" mode and sometimes lose composed email because the network has disappeared for various reasons when I'm trying to send the message. To recreate: 

How do you disable auto-mounting of ALL new/unknown drives on OS X? This article describes how to disable automount on a specific drive: $URL$ But then you have to know the drive UUID. And to find out the UUID you would have to mount the drive, and the second you do that OS X auto-mounts the drive as read+write and starts writing lots of hidden files to the drive (, , , ) before you can say "cake". This is particularly bad if the connected drive is a faulty drive you are going to to rescue work on, then you obviously don't want the Operating System to write to the drive at all. So what do you do to get complete control of the mounting process? 

Switch Gmail to "Basic HTML" mode Compose an email Turn off Wi-Fi (or unplug Ethernet) Send the message 

When playing an MKV movie (h264/aac) with a separate .SRT file, VLC lets me control the looks of subtitles perfectly from the menu. However, after losslessly converting the MKV/SRT to MP4 with built-in subtitles ("mov_text"), the subtitles are displayed as a small Arial(?) font, and VLC settings have no effect on this. I thought maybe the MP4 file contained some information on how to display the subtitles that had precedence, but it happens even after I stripped all metadata from the MP4 file. Is this a bug/feature in VLC? How do I make it adhere to the visual subtitle settings for all sorts of video files. EDIT: SRT EXAMPLE 

According to this article, there's no filesystem, the HDD is more of a "database", and the only way to get data is to put the disk into another Creative device. Seeing as the article is from 2006, I feel inclined to ask if there is now a way to rescue the files using readily available software. The four first bytes of the disk image are . This discussion thread from 2004 is about the only relevant information I found that could shed some light on the disk format. 

So works for both platforms, whereas only works for Mac. My question is: Can I create symbolic links from Mac that will work on both platforms, or am I forced to do this from Windows? PS! I also noticed that the symbolic links created from Windows showed as when doing a from Windows , whereas the Mac symbolic link did not. 

Files that must reside in exact positions on the drive that would be lost in regular file copy Partition data that cannot be re-created with your regular formatting software Special hidden data such as proof of purchase of the OS or installed software 

Is there any fix-all-way to restore the shell back to normal, or do I just have to close the terminal and start a new one? (I am on Mac with Bash at the moment, but I've had this on other systems too.) 

Is this related to GDPR? I've seen several newspaper articles mentioning this. I'm outside the US, and tried this both from home and from a Linux server in another non-US country. 

Result: Safari will show a blank page saying you've got no network, and when you try to go "Back" after regaining network, the message is gone. I thought modern browsers retained user input in fields when going back and forth in tab history. I'd to know where to turn to solve this problem. Is this a bug in Safari/WebKit? Is it a bug in how Gmail is implemented? I'd like a technical explanation of why this is happening. EDIT: Safari does indeed preserve form fields without using JavaScript or server-side tricks. So why does this fail with Gmail? 

When I run it in VLC, I have to press "A" to change aspect ratio to "4:3" to make the video show with the correct aspect ratio. Looking at the video facts, Is the error that a) the actual video has been incorrectly stretched in the pixel data, or b) there is simply some metadata value that has been incorrectly set? If the former, I know I can re-encode the video and change the width and height. But if the latter, what ffmpeg command to I run to fix the metadata without re-encoding the video itself? 

Posted the issue withe the VLC developers, and they claim the issue will be fixed in the forthcoming 3.0 release. 

I just installed Ubuntu in Virtual Box on Mac. It struck me that you have to sit by the machine and answer questions all through the installation process. (Wouldn't it be better to ask all the questions on the first screen, so I can leave the desk and do something else while it installs?) Is there any way to feed the installation a config file with all these settings (user name, locale, etc.?), so I can just press Enter, and then come back 15 minutes later to a completed installation? I want to exercise setting up a Unix machine, to make sure I can do it quickly. So I can install lots of packages and edit config files. But when I want to repeat the whole process from a fresh install, I have to go through the whole tedious installation process again (question 1). Is there a simple way to reset/backtrack Ubuntu to the fresh install I had? (ie. Uninstall all packages, revert all config files, etc.) Is there a tool that helps you automate setting up a Unix server? A script could take care of running apt-get, but adding stuff to php.ini, nginx.conf, etc. how would I do that? (The reason I want do add stuff to existing config files, is to make sure I get all the latest default settings) 

I have a broken external hard drive that spins, but won't come up in , and thus I can't mount it and run on it. (I've rescued many drives before using this method.) When the drive doesn't come up in , is there anything I can do except turn the drive over to professionals and pay a high fee to have the data retrieved? Professional data retrieval often costs $500+, so I would be willing to buy hardware/software for less if it recovered the data and didn't require soldiering or advanced forensics on my side. 

Is there any way to use a white iMac 24" as monitor for an external HDMI device? The iMac has no Video Input port, but is it possible to use some solution with for example USB or Firewire? 

When sending a file from MacBook Air to a simple phone (Nokia 130), I'm getting transfer speeds of around 40 KB/s, meaning a 60 MB file takes 20 minutes, which is ridiculous in our day and age. My current workaround is to transfer files using the SD card, but 1) why is the transfer speed so extremely slow, and 2) what can I do to increase it? 

Can I backup and restore an OS simply by copying and restoring all its files, file by file, rather than copying and restoring the disk partition, byte by byte? Consider: If I have a booting OS on a hard drive, then: 

Does FFmpeg have support for making videos look like they're shown on a CRT TV (ie. the whole scan-line look, possibly with colour adjustment and other tricks to add to the illusion)? 

I have a Windows Server 2012 where I would like to create symbolic links that work for both Mac (10.9) and Windows (7) users. I have a dummy text file called containing "Hello, World!". 

What is the technical explanation of why image noise like this is "revealed" when changing the viewing angle of the screen. Is this the same for all screen types (plasma, LED, OLED, etc.)? This kind of noise is a common mistake. A person who doesn't know better saves an image with high compression and thinks to himself, "This looks OK", and forgets to test the image under non-ideal circumstances (ie. a tilted screen, different calibration, etc.). Does Photoshop et. al. have functionality to warn about almost-invisible noise, since it's such an easy mistake? 

In Terminal, do SSH to a remote host. Close lid. (The network connection is cut off at this point). Wait. Open lid again. 

I am used to the bash command listing only a list of the environment settings, eg. PATH and such. However, on an Ubuntu system I just set up, executing dumps 2000 lines of text, including lots of functions like this: 

How do I fix this? (Obviously, MySQL incorrectly calculates the length of the string, and therefore the right-aligning becomes incorrect.) (I don't know if it's a bug in MySQL, a UNIX setting or a Terminal setting. Terminal settings are: "xterm-256color" and "Unicode (UTF-8)".) 

A typical Debian/Ubuntu installation takes at least 15 minutes, and you have to answer a lot of questions along the way. Yet a VPS service on the Web is able to deploy a ready-to-use Linux server in under 1 minute. I'd like to have my own prepared image file with pre-installed packages that I can plug straight into VirtualBox, or upload to a hosting service, and -bang- there it is, without the 15 minute manual installation or answering any questions. It's just ready in as little time as possible (like a minute or so). How can I achieve this? 

I have some cartoon animation stored in MPEG-2 video that I would like to convert to MPEG-4/h264. The MPEG-2 video compression is rather bad, with both "small" JPEG artefacts around details in the picture and larger JPEG blocks that change slightly hue for each frame. The compressed file gets rather large, because I guess ffmpeg tries to preserve as much of the original as possible, which also means presering all the wrongdoings of the MPEG-2 compression. Since the animation originally consisted of large flat color surfaces that would have been a video compressor's dream, is there a smart way to say: 

Removed HDD from dead Creative MicroPhoto device Put HDD into Compact Flash reader Copied the entire HDD image to my computer (Mac) using (no errors) Tried on the image, which found no filesystem (I'm not an expert on this tool.) 

Does anyone know if it's possible to control the font size on videos played in the built-in iPhone video player? The subtitles (or "Closed Captions") that are there by default are rather small. None of the attempts below change the font size at all: 

We are using a Windows Server 2012 at work to share files among employees. Some of the files that need to be stored are sensitive, so we restrict read access to only a handful of people. However, someone told me you can't rely on WS to retain permissions; that it suddenly and for no reason may suddenly change permissions, so restricted files become accessible for more people than intended. This would have disastrous consequences for the company, so we need to be 100% sure that permissions are retained (disregarding human errors from an administrator! I'm talking purely technical weaknesses.) Is it true WS can't be trusted? If so, what are my options? Are there other file systems that can be run? (Our services are run in an all-Windows environment so Unix file systems are probably not an option.)
