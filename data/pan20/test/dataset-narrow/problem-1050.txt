I've gotten an appartment in a city 25 000km from home as I'll be living there during the weeks, in this appartment I'll have one Mac Pro (10.7), one MacBook Pro (10.6) and maybe one Windows 7 Laptop. Now the thing is that I have my fileserver with most of my files at home and also two other servers (web and development servers) combined with all my other computers and network related stuff. My main server at home which is always almost always running is using Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS, however poweroutages do happen (even if they are rare), the server is setup to automatically start up again so as long the VPN service is autostarting I should be fine. My network at home is a 100/100Mbit/s Fibre Optics connection however I'm not sure what speed I'll be getting at the apartment but there's a risk that it'll only be 10/10Mbit/s or 100/10Mbit/s maybe even slower if I'm really unlucky. So how should I set up this, I guess that I should be using VPNs in some way but how, should I put a router there that in some way connects to the VPN (does consumer routers even handle that), should I set up separate VPN tunnels to each machine locally? I've got a bunch extra laptops laying around, some with express slots and I've probably got some extra desktop to spare as well if absolutely necessary maybe I could setup a VPN to one of these computers and then bridge that connection to the other network port where I put a switch or AP (would that work?). I've never done anything like this before and I don't want to spend a fortune on enterprise equipment to set this up when I probably already have enough hardware to set it up using Open Source software. 

With the Win+ R combo summon . Right click on the service and click . Before it stops, will warn you that the service is being stopped. Only if you are confident that your computer is safe (and are more worried about the using most of your CPU availability) click the button and the service should stop. 

I guess half the battle is won by getting to the command prompt. The rest of the solution provided on the link works of course, but most experienced users of the Windows OS can perhaps manage without it as well. 

This is pretty much a repeat of the question from social.technet.microsoft.com: $URL$ After a quick Google search, the above link is the only link I could find which was directly related to what I am looking for. But on that page the discussion seems to have decayed into some inconclusive babble, and I thought might be a good place to get a conclusive result (even if it is in the negative). So is there a way I can tell Windows to shutdown the machine after it is done installing the updates? Please note that I want it to shutdown and not restart, so that my PC doesn't stay on the whole night. I thought of scheduled tasks, but am not able to come up with a good argument that I can pass to make it do what I need it to. 

I want to install Windows 7 onto an SSD from a USB 3 drive, however it won't let me boot using USB 3, however it does work using USB 2. I guess that's because Windows PE doesn't have the needed USB 3 drivers so my question is how can I fix that? Edit: Sorry for being slightly unclear. The installer boots but after choosing disk drive it tells me that it need drivers for the installation disk (USB3). Edit2: I can get it to work by adding the drivers to another USB memory but I can't get it to work by adding them to the install drive, does anyone know how I should add them to the main media? 

I'm using a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 (SWE) in OS X and have a problem. My "§" and "<" key have changed position which is extremely annoying. 

Download the Microsoft software for OS X here (DMG IntelliType Pro 8.1 for Mac) and install, restart your computer and the set it up as suiting for your region (ISO EU in your case). When you're all done with that the < and § keys should no longer be mixed up and as an bonus you gain all the functionality from the extra keys on your keyboard. 

This has the disadvantage of having to prepare a separate file but it makes replication and documentation of tests easier.

Work out where you first get 100% packet loss of ICMP pings. Try one or two pings to 127.0.0.1, your local external IP interface, your router (if any) or default gateway, ISP hosts (e.g. DNS server, mail server). Try (stop after 3 pings or 12 seconds) and let it finish by itself rather than ending prematurely as some ping, network stacks or networks can cause long delays on ping transmissions: patience can be helpful. [In particular, for Ubuntu, if you see long delays on sending pings (typically a 5s timeout when pinging by hostname), look at $URL$ on how the avahi daemon can introduce these delays.] Possible causes of ping loss: 

I know how to shut-down Avast's shields (the options range from disable for 10 minutes to disable permanently). However, just a few minutes ago, the process started consistently hogging 97% of my CPU power. I couldn't kill the process and neither did disabling the shields help in reducing the CPU load. Though my laptop was connected to a wall outlet, it killed my entire battery (which is quite old). Had I been in a meeting, it would have been the end of the session. I am not sure what triggered the process to go berzerk; all I did a few moments before was to open a Nature link. Restarting the computer has fixed it temporarily. I would like to be able to quickly kill the process if I need to in an emergency. Google provided the following two links but I am not sure that I have a solution: $URL$ $URL$ (the second link recommends turning off ). 

Something really strange happened about 10 minutes ago. I tried to open a file named and instead of running it, Windows 7 asked me to choose a program to open the file with. Without realizing what I was getting into, I accidentally selected (if I remember correctly it was selected by default) and then I clicked OK. To my horror, whichever program I try to run now starts the . Here are a few things I have already tried: 

A simple approach, though not quite what you are looking for... Use a hex editor to create a file with the bytes in that you want to send (you mention gnome so you may already have ghex but any hex editor should be fine). For short hex sequences I usually include the hex as part of the name (e.g. test0x0100af0fe1). Then just redirect the content into , e.g.: 

One method is (assuming you have a working LaTeX installation) to compile the LaTeX diagram to produce a pdf output file (usually using ). This can then be opened using the vector graphics editor Inkscape. Inkscape can import a range of files, including pdf (using the poppler libraries) and can save them as SVG files. (Inkscape also provides command-line conversion capabilities but I don't know whether this is available on a Microsoft Windows system). 

I'm not sure I've entirely understood the question, mainly use Scribus 1.3.3 but occasionally 1.3.5, both on Ubuntu, so the differences in version and platform may outweigh any similarities but, FWIW, ... After creating the table it needs to be ungrouped. Text can then be added to individual cells by selecting the cell (e.g. click on the cell). Individual cells can also be resized by selecting the cell and using the frame handles as usual. A sequence of cells can be selected (select and shift-select each of the cells) and then manipulated together. This can, for example, resize or reposition a whole row or column. Similarly, a column or row of cells, after they are all selected, can be copied and pasted. The new column can have all its cells selected and then slid into position. Spanning can be achieved manually by deleting a cell then expanding a neighbour. However, this sounds just like what you don't want - a bunch of grouped text areas. Anything more complex I import a table constructed elsewhere, not least as I'm no expert in Scribus. 

In our lab we have a couple of our more powerful machines, setup for remote access only. User who are members of the lab domain can log on to any of the lab machines, including the ones I just mentioned, using a single pair of . We have configured the machines such that all the members of the domain can access it remotely. This step is implemented through . I am currently implementing a script in Python through which I want to assign the users specific time slots on the machines — hence the question. Both machines have installed on them. Had Linux been the operating system, I would imagine there would be some file which could be edited by the script according to the time slots. What are the options I have on to solve this problem? 

That's where the Notepad++ feature to show all characters comes in handy. It would have been even more convenient if there were to be a keyboard shortcut for the same. I wasn't able to find one using Google. 

If you have not already looked at Thesycon's DPC Latency Checker Tool and your project is on one of its supported platforms and is non-commercial then you consider using it for free to confirm your conclusions. Details of the tool and next steps are in the page hyperlinked above. One final, obvious, suggestion is to relieve the PC of other work by not running unnecessary processes and ensuring sufficient free RAM may help. 

USB peripheral switches are available from several suppliers (e.g. Maplin in the UK: $URL$ and manufacturers (e.g. ATEN). Some KVM switches also have USB peripheral switching capability (e.g. some ATEN models) -- this is in addition to supporting USB for the keyboard and mouse switching between PCs. You can also have a couple of small USB hubs (or just single USB extension connections) on the desktop and move the printer connector between these manually. I use this for connecting USB flash drives, for example. However, as with USB peripheral switches, it is your responsibility to make sure that moving from one computer to the other is done in a timely fashion that suits the host, the application and the peripheral, e.g. for a USB flash drive you should unmount the drive before unplugging or switching and you may need to follow a similar process for, for example, a USB-connected printer. Whether these would work well with your specific USB device and requirement is not certain but you may be able to get specific advice from the peripheral supplier or switch supplier or current users of the combination. I don't know of any of these that would automatically allow a peripheral to be shared between multiple hosts: for printing, a print server is a better solution unless you want to manually switch between computers each time the printer is needed elsewhere and the manual switching works reliably. 

When I want to see the characters which start a newline (\r) and (\n) For checking a python code for tabs and 4 spaces (basically to distinguish between the two) 

Start task manager with Ctrl+ Shift+ Esc. From select while holding down the Ctrl button. Start command prompt by entering and then execute the necessary commands from the prompt to solve the problem. 

I am completely at a loss here. Apparently I am the only idiot on the internet to have done this (or I am not able to ask Google the right question). I am worried that after I shutdown this browser I won't be able to open it again. The next thing I am going to try is to perform a system restore to a past date. If that fails all I will be left to is to perform searches using my smartphone. 

After a couple of minutes of stopping it, I restarted . The load it put on my CPU after the restart was normal (i.e. less than 10%).
