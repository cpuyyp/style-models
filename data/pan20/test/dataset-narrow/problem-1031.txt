According to Wikiopedia and this vulnerability matrix, BIND takes measures againt these attacks as of version 9.5.0-P1, so you could try an older BIND. 

I used this to migrate a certificate authority from a Win2003 AD server to a Win2008R2 member server (with different name). After completing this task, I wanted to install the web enrollment role service on , but that fails with (translated from German) 

I somehow suspect that the KB rather introduces the problem. Then again, I'm running 15.0.4937.1000 instead of 15.0.4867.1003 anyway ... 

Apparently you have the same networks 192.168.1.0/24 attached to both of your interfaces, butr they are not physically the same. If you cannot alter the address of the scanner network, you need the routing to be specific enough. For example, if your eth0 address is 192.168.1.2/30 and your eth1 address is 192.168.1.4/24 the more specific route via eth0 will only be taken for 192.168.1.0 up to 192.168.1.3. This is still a mess because likely the scanner still has the /24 mask and you still cannot contact 192.168.1.0 up to 192.168.1.3 of the eth1 net, but this may be a (I say it again: horrible) workaround. Another (just as horrible) workaround would be to add a specific host route to 192.168.1.80 via eth1 (I'm somewhat confuse because you tagged this as Windows but use Linux-like NIC names, so I don't add the specific routing command) 

The behavour you observe is exactly as expected. Note that an URL like means that the client has to contact the host (and only to find out whyich host that refers to is what DNS is used for in this context), then initiate a TCP connection to a server process listening on port of that host, then use the protocol to request the URI from . The typical webserver will interprete such a path-like URI as a path relative to its document root and for exmample return the content of a file of that name (or execute a php script or list the contents of a directory [in fact after a redirection] or whatever you configure). So since you are almost happy with the result - just off a directory level - I suggest you reconfigure your webserver to serve from a different document root. On the other hand, your report about doing the right thing suggests that you already have virtual hosting set uop, i.e., the vhost is configured to use that MySite folder as its document root. It should be possible to modify the configuration of your host to serve from the very same document root. Maybe start reading through the vhost-specific configuration files of your webserver (probably located in or similar). Look out especially for options, of course. 

As described in the documentation, you should enter the alternate static ip address via the GUI. It turns out that the ip, mask, gateway, DNS server data of the alternate configuration are not saved in "clear text", but rather under GUID of the NIC as a key named and a reference to that is placed within GUID of the NIC in key . You might give it a try with putting your registry settings inside the interface specific key instead of the global TCP/IP paramaters. Or, to get the effect for all adapters, maybe move the reference I described from a specific adapter up to th eglobal TCP/IP parameters. I haven't tried either of these, but you never know. 

I verified that does not appear anywhere under In server manager under all entries are either http with or ldap with instead of a specific server name. In Active Directory Sites and Services, under there has full access on . Under there are folders and and each contains and and . For all of these, has full access rights. All this looks to me as if I had done everything right - so what could be wrong? 

There is nothing you need to allow specifically for reverse lookup (it is just normal DNS via UDP 53), but most likely you are facing the problem that your mail server is not accepted by other mail servers because of lacking reverse DNS. Especially, this has nothing to do with your internal DNS, but rather with the "official" internet DNS. It is sometimes confusing for beginners whom to ask for remedy, but it is logical after all: When you buy a domain example.com at some registrar, you also register a few DNS servers that are authoritative for the zone example.com (or possibly the registrars servers are used by default). So to make changes to the example.com zone you have to modify the data at these name servers (or have your registrar change it). The reverse DNS is not related to example.com, so not handled by the registrar. Instead, the corresponding sub-zone of in-addr.arpa is delegated to the one providing you with ip addresses, that is your access provider. You'll have to contact them to configure the corresponding rDNS entries (or, in case you have a rather large subnet, have the zone delegated to name servers under your immediate control, but you won't want that). 

Without contact to a domain controller, you can logon indefinitely to it - provided your user name is among the last ten (by default) successfull logons that occured with contact to a domain controller. Note that all these ten slots will typically be used up by the standard user logging on ten times in a row. (Alternatively, you can logon to a local account, and of course that can also be done indefinitely). The trust relationship loss you observe is rather for the machine account logging to the domain, not the user accounts. By default the machine password is changed every 30 days, but even if you do not have contact to the domain for an extended period of time, this should not have effect: The password does not age out at the server,but only at the client (cf. this article) and problems should occur only if something nasty has happened (such as reusing the computer name for a new box or using an old restore point) 

A (fake) network printer is advertized (e.g. from a Linux host) Instead of printing, the communication (in PostScript, say) gets intercepted Things like compression get undone, the result is fed to ... ... a script I write that performs the needed text substitutions The resulting postscript is transmitted to the real printer 

As a consequence, I did not directly install the Web Enrollment. However, as I meanwhile found out, the registry contains a setting that states that Web Enrollment is already installed. Changing the setupstatus from 0x6003 to 0x6001 as suggested solved the problem. 

I found the solution (though I am unsure whether it applies to ldap ingeneral or is something specific to MS active directory). Umlauts are treated as equivalent with their dotless (i.e. dieresis-less) counterparts. Thus instead of specifying "München" one can specify "Munchen". This is also the reason why an object named Munchen cannot be created where München already exists. 

You may be able to allow access to the web interface of th eoruter from th eexternal IP. But don't do that unless you are sure you can restrict this service to requests coming from your site! Alternatively, the suite routers and your own may be configured to connnect via virtual private network (VPN). But don't do that unless you are sure you know how to separate the two local nets (grant privacy to your guests and also protect you from attacks issued by your guests)! In all scenarios, one problem may be tha tyour different internet connections are likely to change their public IP addrresses on a regular basis. You'd need to configure something like dyndns to "find" the other end. 

If your FTP server is successfully connected to its LAN, it has a local ip address and that shows under . Alternatively, type and look for lines with "LISTEN" and port 21. 

As that desriptions asks you to obtain an updated software image from your ISP it looks like your router is "branded" by the ISP. In that case even a valid firmware update from the original vendor may be considered invalid by the current (branded, non-vendor) firmware. Maybe you should actually follow those directions and check with your ISP for updated firmware. 

We have a MS Word document template with vba code produced and signed by an external firm. When I view the details of the signing certificate from within Word vba developer tools, it shows up with the hint "You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate" - which sounds weird, given that this is by an external firm. When I use certmgr.msc to check the same certificate (it is the same according to fingerprint and all), it is shown without the private key hint - which is more like what I would haveexpected, but it's stange that the answer differes. What is this trying to tell me? (I confirmeed this using different accounts on different machines) 

Note: The fourth step disrupts connectivity from TEMPDNS to your 192.168.10.* LAN, but your remote session is stillworking because it is actually originating from TEMPAD in the 192.168.11.* LAN In step 6 the following magic happens (I hope): The machine asks its configured DNS server 192.168.10.2 (i.e., TEMPDNS) for the address of an AD server. It gets as a reply your original AD servers in 192.168.10.* and 192.168.11.200 (i.e., TEMPAD). Connection attempts to the 192.168.10.* AD servers fail, so ultimately 192.168.11.200 is tried (as I said, it may be better to avoid the attempts to connect 192.168.10.* by crippling the DNS on TEMPDNS). The connection to 192.168.11.200 succeeds: We have a working forward route 192.168.10.36 -> 192.168.10.1=TEMPDNS -> TEMPAD and backward rout TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.200=TEMPAD -> 192.168.10.36. Once all repairs have completed, donÄt forget to undo all the crap above. 

Is my idea feasible? And am I right that everything except step 4 should be available from basic tools? If so, could someone shed some lights on how I could really do this? I know too little about the internals of Windows/Linux network printing, CUPS and Samba and whatnot to feel confident how to proceed ... 

It is unclear what file format you used to hold the text and which application is used to display the content of that file. As a general rule, you must ensure that the character-encoding of the text matches the encoding the program expects and also that the font used supports all characters needed. If you say that only some of the characters look weird (those with some kind diacritics, I assume: ĄĆĘŁŃÓŚŹŻąćęłńóśźż) it is most likely that one of the two parties uses UFT-8 and the other a specific code page such as ISO8859-2 or Windows-1250. If there were a problem with the font, the most likely effect would be that placeholders (empty squares) are displayed, and I understand that this is not th ecase here. (More could be said if you gave specific examples of a case of expected and displayed text) 

Uninstalling KB3203386 of the June 13 updates really worked, immediately. Now with some temporal distance, I can confirm once more that it caused the problem: The July updates come with KB3213555, which supersedes numerous updates, including KB3203386. Consequently, when KB321555 got installed, the problem was back. Fortunately, uninstalling KB321555 helps immediately. 

With the usual settings to autosave every 10 minutes, and to keep the last autosaved version when closing without saving, it happens occasionally that these settings seem to not be obeyed. For example, Word crashes after a lot of typing and asks to wait or restart. At first attempt, I choose "wait", but without success. Then I pick "restart word", and I am presented a restored version of the document that was open. But while I expect to find a version that is at most 10 minutes old, it often happens that it is hours old. What could be wrong? 

Now proceed as follows, using two boxes TEMPAD (with ip 192.168.11.100, say) and TEMPDNS (with 192.168.11.200, say): 

A few network printers have been removed from the print server and I wish to automatically remove them by a script (e.g. using in vbs) from any client still referencing them; preferably, I would like to really know which printers I'm deleting in those cases and automatically connect an appropriate replacement printer. This would not be difficult if I could read the list of such defunct printers in the first place. The situation in the GUI is that the printers still show up under "Devices and printers" with the printer symbol showing only the default printer icon,being greyed out, and a yellow warning triangle shown next to it. But the printer does not get listed e.g. by the WMI query "". Is there any other query that would succeed for this? 

This is expected behaviour, though mostly for preventing gross misconfigurations. If a certificate could be associated with a contact with not matching mail address, things get broken quickly. (E.g., just let me alone for thirty seconds with your computer and I add my cert to your best friends contact without you noticing and henceforth can forge mails which you accept as undoubtedly coming from them - after all they have valid digital signatures). Even if you succeeded, it is likely that the receiver does not have access to their previous private key (probably stored on the computer they had available at their old company) Request a new certificate from the receiver, matching their new email address. 

It appears that Google wants to use only for internal puposes. Under that assumption it seems to be safe to host a "fake" dev zone on your internal DNS server 

Windows Active Directory maintains a list of subnet to sites assignments (in "Active Directory - Sites and Services" -> Sites -> Subnets). The subnet-to-site associationas ar used, obviously, by workstations in order to select a suitable DC to authenticate with. But how can this information be used programmatically for other purposes? For example: Given an IP, I would like to obtain things like the Site name as found in the properties in the best matching subnet. With what have found so far, I could list all subnets and do the subnet matching with all of them myself - but as this task is in one way or other performed with every workstation reboot, I am sure that there is some direct method for this ... 

We have several Windows 2008 RDP servers organized in a farm. Is there an easy ways to remotely read out each servers relative weight in the farm? (The setting configurable in , in section "Configure settings", under heading "Remote desktop session broker", on entry "meber of farm in remote desktop connecton broker", right-click "propreties", on "remote desktop connection broker" property sheet, setting "relative weight of server in the farm" (all labels translated from German, so possibly not accurate) One way would be to access the registry (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\ClusterSettings\ServerWeight), but I wonder if there is something nicer (for whatever definition of nice). 

The success of the first two points deopends on the number of other hosts newly attached / booted to the network and also the lease times. 

Until recently, things worked fine, but they do not anymore - unless I switch to "Enable all macros (not recommended)", which I do not want to do permanently for apparent reasons. I am unaware of any changes made recently except updates. What can I do? Apparently, Word does not like my signature - but it cannot be more valid than described above, can it? EDIT: After some research, I stumbled over KB3203386, which got installed recently. Among the issues that it is supposed to fix(!) is: 

I need to apply some modifications (mostly replace some text a la ) to everything that gets printed from a specific Windows application. My guess is that most of the building blocks that can be used for this are already available somewhere. My idea is to proceed as follows: 

The size of the network is small enough and the bandwidth requirement high enough to justify the suggestion to build a fully-meshed network. A dedicated hub-and-spoke would also be fine but would then make it preferable to store all data centrally. 

A certificate may be issued with several purposes. To make sure you can check the properties of your certificate. For example in windows, if you double-click the *.cer file and go to the details page, you can see the allowed purposes in the list of properties. But if the certificate was created originally "just" for a webserver, the chance is zero that code signing is listed. 

RDP to TEMPAD and install the AD role on TEMPAD On TEMPAD set a static route to host(!) 192.168.10.36 via 192.168.11.200 From within your RDP session on TEMPAD, start an RDP session to TEMPAD and install DNS on TEMPDNS. It should serve your AD zone; I'm not sure if it should rather serve a crippled AD zone with all references to the 192.168.10.* AD servers removed, see hints below. Add secondary IPs 192.168.10.1/24 and 192.168.10.2/24 on TEMPDNS and enable IP forwarding. Ask a person at the 192.168.11.* site to turn on the problem computer When the boot has completed, start an RDP session to 192.168.10.36 from within your RDP session to TEMPAD. You can now login as whoever you want.
