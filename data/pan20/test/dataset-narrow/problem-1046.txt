Firstly ntpdate is depreciated so you shouldn't use that in a production environment now. You should configure and run the ntp daemon correctly configured instead for a reliable timing setup and removing the chances that you will jump the server time (as ntp will continually adjust the clock as required) As you have seen the problem with just using the pool is that you may get any server it decides based on the dns query, in your situation you should pick 3 - 5 low stratum servers directly and add those to your config on both machines. ntp likes to have a minimum of 3 servers and ideally 5 to sync from to ensure a robust time domain. If you pick some low stratum servers they should all be within a few ms of each other (if not better) and provided they are configured correctly you shouldn't need to worry. If your requirements grow and you need to sync more machines then you could run your own server to ensure that what you serve internally only ever comes from 1 reference source at a time. 

Unless you have any specific requirement not to, I'd remove the old version & its config and install the current (version 8) with a fresh config file and try with a fresh install. Presuming you use yum as your package manager & you installed Rsyslog from it, update your repo file at to add; 

Note that I had to use my own addresses as I'm configured for a different subnet etc, and I don't have DNS Keys setup so am unable to test that. A couple of things to check; What have you got set in You should have a line like this; so that your box asks its self for NS lookups I suspect your machine is configured to use another DNS server. What's the IP address of you box - you had an error in your original question with having a reverse address of and a forward of 

If you are on a linux client with ntp installed & configured to point at the Windows DC you can do; which will return all the info. If you need help to understand it please post it here and we can help. or which will do a 1 time query of the time/date but NOT set the client. 

You need a paper clip (to poke the reset button on the card) while its installed & powered up. Press & hold for 5 sec. Also see this link to the APC website which is the pdf giving the setup guide and help for that network card. Once you have the card reset you should be able to connect via a web browser to its default IP. The default user/pass is 'apc' The web interface is easier/better than the serial/telnet/ssh menu system. If for someone reason the reset doesn't work then you could connect the card in its configured state to a spare ethernet port or via a laptop using an IP within the range it was configured for and access it that way (presuming you know the login details) then just change the IP and other settings via the web interface. If you don't know the IP the card had you could run wireshark against it and see what that tells you. 

The short answer is 'no' the UPS you provided the link too has a built in NIC and USB port for management and controlling server shutdown etc. You can connect the UPS to your existing network or connect directly to your server via USB (Provided you can get the software for your OS). Check the APC documentation and that should tell you the default IP so you can configure the UPS. You don't say what you want to 'manage' but once the UPS is on the network you will be able to setup SNMP, email alerts and get access to the web portal of system settings (Voltage adjust, low battery warning time etc.) With regards to having it shut down a server you have a couple of choices so should look at the software options on the APC site here. 

I recently installed Windows 10. There's like a 50% chance that when I click to execute a .msi or .exe installer I just downloaded through Chrome that it will take 10 minutes before I get the UAC prompt. Same thing happens if I double-click the icon in Explorer. My icon turns to an hour glass for a half second, and then it doesn't do anything. Some time later after I've forgotten about it, a UAC prompt will appear. Usually 2 or 3 of them because I've clicked the icon so many darn times -- they all appear at once. After it appears, everything is snappy -- I can step through the wizard and finish installing without problems. I don't know if it's quietly scanning the program, or checking permissions or what, but it's preventing me from getting work done. How do I fix this? 

Spaces. The reason is spaces. There's a space in . If you put that into a shell command as-is it will be interpreted as two separate arguments. and . This is, of course, very easy to fix by simply quoting it, or , however, some programs manage to screw this up. To work around this problem, or to make it easier for lazy script-writers, programs are sometimes installed into directly. Note that even if the program developer is diligent and escapes all his file paths correctly, it's possible that some library or some external script somewhere in the chain won't. Programs have so many dependencies that sometimes it's easier to just not use spaces than trying to get everyone on board. 

Is there a feature or add-on in XBMC so that I can scan/fast-forward through a movie using thumbnails at ~1 minute intervals, like the PS3 has? 

The website I'm developing uses a lot of popups. It is handy for me to be able to edit the address in the address bar so that I can append variables and such. FF seems to prevent me from doing this. Is there a plugin that will unlock it again? 

I'm using the Crop (C) tool to crop 3 or 4 images out of a larger image. After I crop each image and save it, I have to hit undo a bunch of times to uncrop it and get back to the original image. I'd rather just crop the image to a new file/tab. Is that possible? 

I'm having trouble connecting to a particular website. I can view it through a proxy, but not from home. So I ran a traceroute: 

It just opens a new command prompt rather than using the current one. Is there a way to force it to use the current prompt? 

FYI, mozenda works really well and is really easy to use... but they only have a free trial version, and their marketing strategy is really shady. 

Yes, you can dual-boot it. I know ubuntu plays nicely if you install it after win7, I don't know if win7 is as friendly... but it's very possible either way. Yes, you can always reinstall. You'll lose your programs and such of course. Yes, Netbooks usually come with a recovery CD. If not, you can always make one. Didn't even know about UNR... looks pretty cool. I'd try it out :) 

I've got a folder in my project called "Data". I want all the files in it to have the property . Problem is every time I copy files into this directory via explorer, I have to remember to then copy the files into my actual project as well and then change the properties again. Is there a way to keep this folder sync'd/up to date in Visual Studio? 

Better yet would be if it encrypted and uploaded in one swoop, without wasting a ton of disk space while it copies everything to my C drive (which is a tiny SSD). 

How to view in Vim if there is any end of line character at the end of the file? If file content is '1234' as by Vim shows (with option) '1234$'. If file content is '1234\n' as by Vim again shows '1234$'. How do I distinguish between these two different contents if they are shown as same? Is there any other way how to inspect EOL chars using Linux default tools? 

In learning materials is often a picture of one TCP segment which is inside one IP datagram which is in one link-layer frame. Is this always the case? Is there guarantee that TCP segment is atomic and is contained within one IP datagram? Does the same apply for datagram and frame? What I mean is this: 1. 

I noticed rather annoying behavior in gvim which relates to changing my Linux distro to openSUSE. When switching from insert to normal mode (hitting ESC) the cursor needs at least second! to become normal mode wide cursor even though insert mode indicator dissapears immediately. Going from normal to insert mode is ok and the cursor becomes "thin" cursor immediately. What can be the cause? 

Am I right in the assumption that it is not part of that 'shared' hdd but it is just a mounting point for a hdd/partition dedicated to one machine? (so basically not stored with other files at all) 

I understand that networking uses sockets as well but I am wondering if Unix domain (IPC) sockets somehow relate to network layer. If so, does this use network HW somehow? Does it work like a loopback? If not, then why are listed by in Linux ? 

Evidently it is because foreign address of the 127.0.0.1 is and option shows only ports with I suppose the is ip6 format. But why option shows only ip4 ports? 

I have MBR data in file and I would like to inspect it. Which Linux command can do this? WHen I ran the output was only 

The fact that is supposed to be shared among multipple machines and users does not help grasping the use of word 'shared' here which is meant to be shared across different architectures. This makes me wonder: 

I expected that this would be everything necessary to get the Internet working but DNS did not work without adding to . What is the purpose of the DNS setting in *.network file then? 

However I can't find what this option is. My guess from context would be that it sets non-interactive mode for the shell but it is just a guess. 

I am wondering if the hard-disk can be somehow repaired in this condition or if it can be just scrapped. 

I can add virtual WiFi interface with but this is not persisted and gets lost when the system is restarted. What is the proper way to make this permanent ? 

I have 6 nameserver entries in resolv.conf. Due to the recent changes in our network I added last 2 recently and did not bother commenting the old ones as I thought that having extra nameservers won't effect if the name is resolved or not and it will probably just take little bit more time. But without commenting out the previous 4 nameservers the names wont't resolve and I am just wondering why. Even in resolv.conf manual I see: 

I am attempting to setup a WiFi network with on ArchLinux where I have and (not anymore in ArchLinux). As I am reading some tutorials they offen refer to when setting up static ip for the wifi network interface. Is this file relevant also on systems with or should I use CLI to setup the static ip address ? 

I am using desktop and would like to have certain commands available in which just executes commands. I am appending to in but this works only for interactive shells. I have tried it with / but to no avail as well.
