There isn't an .profile for only su, but you could write a .profile which detects if you're su'ing. If you are su'd, then "who am i| awk '{print $1}'" will be the user you came from, while "whoami" will be the user you became. If these are different, then you su'd, so do what you need to. 

It could be a mis-configured website, which is issuing a redirect to a private IP address which happens to be the same as the private IP address of your router. 

This camera, like most cameras nowadays, is compatible with SDHC, SD and MMC cards. MMC & SD cards have a maximum size of 2Gb, while SDHC has a maximum capacity of 32Gb. In order to get a card of 1Tb, you'd need to have a camera capable of using SDXC. This new format was announced at CES in 2009, with a maximum capacity of 2Tb, and the first cameras to use it are coming onto the market this spring, for example the Canon A3100 IS, or the A495. However as far as I'm aware, the biggest SDXC card you can presently get is 64Gb, shipping by both SanDisk and Panasonic, costing $350 and $600 respectively. 

Filesystems in general get slow when they get full. It's due to fragmentation. On an empty disk, you can be sure that you can write a file in one block. As the filesystem gets fuller, then the chances of being able to fit the file into a single contiguous block decreases, and you're having to do more and more seeks to find the data, converting what was originally a sequential access of data into a more like a random access of data, and thus slower. 

How are you testing that 80 is blocked? A lot of ISP's block port 80 to stop people running webservers on consumer accounts. 

On most systems, including Linux, unless the clock is very off, ntpd doesn't set the clock, it instead varies the length of a second, so that the clock slowly becomes into sync with the master. This is calling clock skewing, and it's beneficial because it's usually better for a second to be slightly wrong than for seconds to be missed, or even worse, redone. 

A CRT can be blury if the grid becomes magnetized. If your monitor has a degauss control, then activating it will fix the problem. 

If you do 'id', you'll see your primary group, listed as something like gid=1000(student). By default, all files will be created with that group. However, that is not your problem. If you are a member of a group which has write permission to a directory, then you can create a new file. Are you sure that the permissions on www is correct? Do 'ls -ld www'. 

There is no general way that a program can extract the links from a .swf file. A swf file can contain applets, and these applets can require any resource they feel like. The best way to do it is probably to use something like wireshark, and see what requests the flashsite is actually doing. 

It uses the standard 32 bit x86 kernel, and therefore will work on any intel based system, including your celeron. 

802.11b and 802.11g both use the same frequency band, 2.4Ghz. 802.11n can also use the 5Ghz frequency band. By using this area as well as 2.4 you get more available channels, so potential for less interference. Also in the 5Ghz band 802.11n uses channels which are twice as large, which increases the speed. Therefore a dual-band wireless router, which is 802.11n enabled, will give you faster bandwidth, less interference, and better reliability. 

I posted an explanation to an earlier question as to why you cannot simply add up the total space and expect that to match up to the amount of free space. I think it applies to this too. NTFS doesn't have the deleted files but still existing, but the other two points still apply. 

It will still be scanning for networks, which means receiving and processing broadcast packets. It is possible for these packets to be malformed, and if the stack is buggy, then this malformed packet could trigger a bug and then compromise the laptop. I've never heard of an actual attack using this method, there are going to be so few laptops in this state compared to the number actually attached to a network that it seems to be a very strange way to attack a system, but if you're worried, disable the wifi card when you're not using it. Of course, if you want to be really secure, you need a concrete box. 

The USA doesn't forbid the export of secure cryptography. They used to, until 1996, when it became clear that it was pointless and the restrictions were dropped. 

There are three times on a Unix filesystem, the access time (atime), the modification time (mtime), and the inode change time (ctime). You can change the access time and the modification time with the touch program, for example 

Yes, you can do a remote desktop on Linux. The standard RDP protocol is supported, assuming that the appropriate packages are installed. Since you don't know which distribution you're running, I can't tell you which packages are appropriate. You can also do a VNC desktop. VNC is a protocol which is lighter weight than RDP. Thirdly, you can also run X applications over a network. If you run 'ssh -x hostname' then any X programs running on the remote system will display on the local system. 

First you sound a bit confused. You cannot login to a webserver using a ftp client. You access a webserver using a webbrowser. If you want to remove files from the default listing of files that a webserver will produce if there isn't an index file, then perhaps the easiest way is to write a cgi program which will exclude those files you don't want to see, and output the names properly formatted. 

In order to delete a file in a directory, you need to have write permission to that directory. Obviously the users are creating directories without you having write permission, in which case the answer to your question is no, you can't do anything without talking to the user in question or the sysadmin. However, if I was the sysadmin, I would be worried about what you're doing. It is not normal for users to be creating files in other users directories. Is there a better way of doing what you're doing? For example, uploading to a suitable web application would give better control, and also mean that you don't have to worry about this. 

You're probably gaining some benefits. You can handle 'simple' requests with apache, which will be faster. You can add access controls, rewrite urls, and other things which apache can do for you. 

It sounds to me like you're going in the wrong direction. If you want a file which you can write to, but not read, then file permissions is what you're looking for. 

Two options Firstly Ubuntu includes a program called WUBI which will create a large file on the window's disk, and use it as a filesystem for Linux. Secondly, you can install a VM version of Linux. Virtualbox is free and open. Both options will impart a bit of a performance hit compared to 'raw' Linux, but not a big enough hit to be too annoying. 

You can always download the latest perl from $URL$ You'll need to unarchive, and run Configure. I personally usually prefer having my own installation of perl, even when the basic OS included a version. That means that my scripts can be upgraded to later versions on my schedule, not the maintainers. 

will display all the paramaters. You'll have to calculate the ratio yourself. There isn't any way to change the ratio on an existing ext2/3/4 filesystem you have to create a new filesystem. 

If you want to program it in C, then you want to be looking at the gettimeofday(2) function. This returns a structure which contains a time_t (accurate to the nearest second), and a tv_usec (accurate to the nearest microsecond). By doing two of these, and appropriate math, you can get the interval. Note that even though the systemcall returns microseconds, you can't get an interval that small. The actual resolution can be seen in /proc/timer_list. Of course, a programing question would be better on stackoverflow. 

Ok, firstly there aren't any truely LED monitors. What you can buy nowadays is a LED backlight LCD monitor. On that basis, I don't think there is any difference at all. LED backlight monitors do have a better contrast ratio, but I don't think that they're yet good enough to have a real difference to eyestrain. 

ImageMagick will convert to/from odg as well. Don't know if it will handle your specific BPI issues, but it might be worth looking into. 

povray will run from the command line with no graphics, and obviously will accept a subset of pvoray syntax. What problems are you having with it? It would seem to be more sensible to fix those problems than trying to avoid them.
