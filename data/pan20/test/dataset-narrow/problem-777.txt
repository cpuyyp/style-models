I am trying to compile Nginx from source based on the original compiled Nginx server running on my DigitalOcean server ( Ubuntu-14.04 64x ) but with a few extra modules. I can get everything installed smoothly but I can not get it to start. I am sure the ini is correct because I copied the original source off the current running Nginx server [ Even though I see that Nginx now adds the ini when compiling fron source ]. Below is the [ lengthy process ] that I am performing - add sorry but I wanted to be thorough for those who are in need of the info ]. Because I am a newB to Nginx, I am sure I am missing something or just have it all wrong. If you may look over what I have done and see if you spot anything I need/need to change, I will greatly appreciate it. Thnx! With the original Nginx server still running: I check the current/running Nginx configuration so I can build the new Nginx instance the same but with the added modules: 

Next step: I cd to root and I check the old Nginx folder locations and double checked the 'make' output to see that they are the same: 

I don't really want to have to install consumer applications on my server in order to be able to configure group policy. My preference would be to just point my server to the appx files for the aforementioned applications. So the question is, where can I get the appx files for the above applications. I have tried the installation locations on a Windows 10 PC and also I tried extracting the install.wim from the Windows 10 source files, both to no avail. There was also some mention on the web of using Fiddler to grab the source file URL when downloading it from the Windows Store, but that didn't work for me either. Or do I need to configure the Group Policy from a remote Windows 10 machine and point to the locally installed applications? Any help greatly appreciated. 

I have configured by domain controller with a group policy to "Automatically configure profile based on Active Directory Primary SMTP address". The Autodiscover is working as expected and it connects to my hosted Exchange server. The issue is that the cached user name is being picked up from the domain, in the following format user@domain.local Is it possible to control which user name is being passed, so that I can pass a user name in the correct format, which in this case is the primary SMTP address. PS. I don't want to use a UPN suffix. I want to be able to specify the email logon name independently of changing AD setting. Thanks, 

You really need to talk to the Network and/or Host Server administrator about this. If for example you're in a corporate environment they might not be too happy with you if you did something like this. That said, you could probably use an SSH Tunnel, though I don't know how practical that would end up being. 

Instead of linking to the static files directly use your controller to read in the files and return them. Then in order to avoid the extra overhead on every call, cache the files in a separate cache location. You can then use the same process to cache your dynamic content and you it could also allow you to build things like your css dynamically. For example you could merge the css from different modules into one file or change the human readable JavaScript into a highly minimized version. 

FreeBSD*... Just saying... Seriously any of the ones listed as having packages are probably good candidates. *I know it's not Linux 

I'm assuming here that by "\u002f" you mean "/" and you mean the brackets "[]" to be part of the substitution and not in the actual URL. EDIT Ok, since you mean you want to rewrite the HTML output with mod_proxy_html. Then I think it would be something like this. 

Do/should I ?? Or what package do I use being that its a custom package and earlier did nothing?? If you need to see the conf files I copied over from the old to the custom server, LMK and I'll post them. Again your help here would be appreciated! 

I copy/create the files that I saved earlier to txt files in sites-available, the config, default and ini files then symlink them to sites-enabled, and so on. And now to start the server: And this is where s#!+ hits the fan - Nada. I check to see if Nginx is running and its not. Also with and its not installed??? I reboot the system too and still nothing. So I am not sure what is wrong here. The ini was copied over from the old server along with all the other config files after deleting the old files. When I opened the new compiled files, the nginx default data was present so I replaced them with my old original data prior to starting the new server for the first time. Also to be safe, I and symlinked with with no errors and I verified that the data was in the sites-enabled/default file. I don't think the server really/fully installed because of the result: 

You'll probably need to tweak these because I don't understand all of what you're trying to accomplish. For example the RewriteCond below seemed redundent so I left it out. If you really are trying to rewrite everything under the guide directory you'll have to incorporate it back in. 

For a reverse proxy, fixing the links in your content output (as mentioned in the other answer) is the better way to go, however mod_proxy_html is another possibility. That said, if you're serving both applications out of the same Apache server why bother with the two virtual hosts? You should be able to serve two different languages from the same virtual host, that way you can skip the reverse proxy step completely. 

Another option is if you're willing to run your own DNS server, you can use includes to easily have the same config for all domains. I do this and then have my DNS Provider replicate the settings from there. Doing this adds a bit of overhead on the maintenance side though. 

Unison might work, I believe it meets all your criteria. It can work peer-to-peer, but if this is for more than 2 users it'll be easier to have a central location to sync to. 

Finally, I added a Task Sequence to "Install Applications" (Not sure if this is required) and set the value 'SkipApplications=YES' in the Custom.ini to skip the applications screen. I have also checked the applications packages by installing in the traditional way using the Task Sequence. Any pointers/help greatly appreciated. 

I am trying to configure the following GPO object for a Windows 10 machine, on Windows Server 2012 R2. Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Application Control Policies > AppLocker > Packaged app rules I need to add the following exceptions: 

I am trying to install applications using Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 Update 2, based on the specific Manufacturer and Model of the client computer. But the applications are not installing. I have installed SQL Express using the default settings (which creates a database called SQLEXPRESS) I have installed SQL Management Studio and given access rights to the database to an account called MDT_BA. As per the following article. $URL$ I have gone into the SQL Configuration Manager and enabled 'Named Pipes' I have created an inbound Firewall rule for TCP port 1433 and UDP port 1434 and also added an inbound rule for "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn\Sqlservr.exe" I manually started the "SQL Server Browser" service. I have created my MDT database using the following settings. 

What you probably want to do is a reverse proxy. Assuming the other websites on the linux server are running under Apache. Then using mod_proxy your config would be something like this: 

A better way to accomplish what you want might be to, if possible, match the records in both name servers then switch the name servers first. That way no matter what name server the client gets it will give the same answer. Then when you're sure the new name servers are working you can lower the TTL there and switch the individual records. Also, since the fqdn of the name servers will likely be different, I think the time it takes for clients to make the switch will be affected more by the time it takes the registrar (GoDaddy) to make the change with the root name servers than the TTL of the NS records themselves. 

As an alternative to setting up your own email server you may want to check with your Domain Name Registrar they often provide low cost email services that would let you do forwarding. A service such as Google Apps would also allow forwarding (and a bunch more) and is easy to setup. Your milage of course may vary but I've always found the "simplest" servers to be the ones I don't have to setup.
