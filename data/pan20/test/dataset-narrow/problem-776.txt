Insert another condition, like , before your RewriteCond. Or just use more conditional rewrites for HTTPS: 

IIS uses the local computers credentials (\ISSCOMPUTER$), not the users (or service principals) one. Just ad the (AD) account of the machine to your target. Maybe it now comes to another common problem â€“ where the web server is in another (or no) domain, and the UNC share is in somewhere else. You can still configure it by setting up the remote share as a Null Session share. You can set up a Null Session by following the steps in this Technet article on how to create Null-Sessions. 

The is no 'history' of all the names a workstation ever had, but this may help you in this case. (kudos to the guys of ugg.li) 

I would recommend a (Hard-)RAID0/1 on this for better performance and availability. But this configuration will be slow anyway - get all the cache and BB you can find on the controller (nearly all DL3xx are capable of BBWC/BBFC). 

Any Ideas where to look for this? It is haunting me into my sleep :-( Updates: Surely I checked the local policies on the server(s). any changes would have surprised me - there are a lot of servers. Also checked the clients GPO, nothing. 

The solution in my case was the option "Restrict delegation of Credentials to remote Servers". Basically, there is a new Group policy settings that can prevent a system to pass credentials to a remote server. This was exactly the issue. you can find this setting in your lokal oder domain group policy under: 

There is no (easy) auditing itself (except audit logs), but you can use to check regularly (usage here). 

You can just have a look in the scheduled tasks (and their history). There is no 'show me all remote triggers that point to me' function, as that would be a bit complicated. 

DNS is usually small and does not need an own box. Just set one up on one of your reliable servers (like file or mail). 

No it's not (easily) possible. The guest never knows how it's process threads are executed - that's why we have hypervisors in the first place. 

Note that in the command to save the permissions there is no slash. Here you can read why this is important. 

Wordpress does not redirect your URLs at will - but it stores every old URL along with its creating post, even if no longer used. If you change a post slug, Wordpress redirects (301) the old to the new URL. This has nothing to do with .htaccess, it's a wordpress function. Unfortunately, I've never seen this feature properly documented in the codex. Hence I cannot tell you which wp_core function does this and where in the core it is located (and you do not want to touch the core, right?). The previously used slug(s) are stored in the database in the table. Check for in the meta_key column (the actual slugs being stored in the meta_value column). If you ever want this default behavior not to happen in a particular case, this is where to delete a value and search for "used" URLs. 

This is known as pinning. Ubuntu has some high-level documentation available here which recommends reading a man page for further information about specific syntax for the configuration file in question. 

and tell you what sasl plugin types are available. I would assume those would return errors or empty lists if sasl support was not enabled at build time (though possibly not). You could also check the output of and see if it links to a sasl library or not (though it might be possible for postfix to be built with sasl and not link to a sasl library if it supports it via a plugin or something, I don't know whether it does or not). 

According to that documentation it looks like anywhere on the ISO you want as long as you point the path to it correctly in the preseed/url parameter. The example documentation puts it in the root of the ISO filesystem. That being said an ISO is a not a zip file and extracting and recreating one is not as simple as a similar operation for a zip file (though there are plenty of tools that should allow you to recreate the ISO as needed). It might be simpler, if you have an http/ftp server to stick the file on briefly, to just use that for this. 

This appears to be something that the javascript on the google page is doing. I don't see it in firefox with noscript enabled and stop seeing it in Chrome on Windows if I disable javascript. I don't know what specifically as I haven't dug any deeper than that. 

I would suggest that you simplify your life tremendously and avoid going down this route any farther and instead see about finding a package for the 6.2 version and either using that directly (if possible) or building a package from the source package for it. If all else fails you should be able to take the current (5.9) source package and replace the version bits (and possibly patches) and try to build a package from it with the version you want (6.2). Using a package (yours or someone else's that are built correctly) will avoid the large amounts of pain you will inevitably encounter trying to do this all from source when you aren't comfortable with this stuff. 

If this is a new environment I would just create the new git user like normal and then run through the gitolite setup for that user (and forget the gitolite3 user). If you really want to keep the current gitolite configuration/repositories/etc. you can probably just copy all the relevant files to that user once you are done (and make sure the ownership information is updated) and it might Just Work (check the gitolite docs on moving the repos to a new machine in case it lists any extra gotchas about this process). 

sendmoreinfo is right, watches for changes in file size. Sometimes this does not happen correctly on mac clients (especially when samba is involved). I ended my search in this phenomenon after two days, the mac smb client is just wired sometimes (ever tried to connect to shares with signature check twice?). 

The problem is, my user(s) can edit and delete files like they have full access. Even if the 'effective permissions' show no right to edit, the still can. The script works fine and looks like this: 

The RSAT-Setup (MSU) just adds the tools to your windows image, but does not install them. You have to activate them by yourself ("Activate Windows-Features", just type 'Feature' into the Start Menu). You can use the commandline, too: 

Are you sure that's not the sever's authentication certificate display? This certificate makes sure, the server you are sending your credentials to is the server (or gateway or broker service) you connected to in the first place (judging by it's name [CN] on the certificate). 

Your description read exactly like this KB: "Poor network performance on virtual machines on a Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V host if VMQ is enabled". VMQ must be disabled for your adapters. If that is not working, check the eventlog why. 

Increase scheduling priority This policy setting determines which user accounts can increase the base priority class of a process. It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority class. Specifically, this security setting determines which accounts can use a process with Write Property access to another process to increase the run priority that is assigned to the other process. A user with this privilege can still change the scheduling priority of a process through the Task Manager user interface. Or shorter: A User can do with his User Process whatever he wants. 

I came into work last week, checked my first ticket (easy to fix one), RDP'd into the server needed for this and the login did not work. After clicking 'connect' I got the "Unable to Log You on Because of an Account Restriction" message. Checked another server (all machines are 2008R2/2012R2), the same message. No, I do not habe an empty password, not using network auth, my clint is Windows 10 (1607). Here is what I did: 

Thats right. Teaming distributes the TCP traffic over multiple interfaces (which do have multiple mac addresses), but that's done in the driver, not the IP-Stack. You application won't know about, like you vm doesn't. 

You need to paste the rpmfusion.repo (or whatever) file from your /etc/yum.repos.d directory. That being said that error either means the file is incomplete or the mirrorurl that is configured is broken (i.e. not returning any values) or no longer exists (assuming yum wouldn't give a different error for either of those conditions). Given the contents of that file it appears as if you have misconfigured the repo. You can see this by trying to load in your browser and inspecting the output. Notice the error indication and the fact that all lines are commented out. You need to adjust the mirrorlist entries in those repository configuration blocks to match your system. You probably want to use something like and friends. 

Drop the awk if that doesn't show what you expect. The output might differ slightly from what I got. If you are speaking the cvs wire protocol directly you can do a similar thing without the directory hackery I believe but I'd have to dig a bunch more to sort that out again. (I believe Zend/Eclipse does that when it detects an older cvs server version.) 

openssl ciphers will tell you what openssl will translate your cipher spec string into. Use to see verbose information about the ciphers listed. So for your listed cipher string on my CentOS 6 system I get: 

Installing an extra root certificate on the server is not going to help a browser trust the server certificate the server sends it. The browser needs the root certificate locally in order to construct the chain of trust when the server sends it the certificate. If you check the certificate dialogs in Chrome and Firefox I believe you will discover that Chrome has found the root CA installed locally and has constructed a correct valid chain whereas firefox has failed to do the same (because it does not have the necessary root CA locally). Installing root CA certificates in browsers is a fairly simple process once you have the appropriate certificate file. The certificate dialogs in the various browsers all have an 'import' button of some sort that you can use for this task. If your certificate requires intermediate certificates then those should, for best compatibility and correctness, be sent by the server during the SSL handshake process. That requires the intermediate certificates to be configured on the server the same way as the server certificate is (that is they must exist in a file and Apache must be pointed at that file with the SSLCertificateChainFile (or similar) directive). 

Yes, thats the default behaviour. For any IP address - the 'name' field is dynamically filled by the client. 

The command is used to mount NFS based network shares whereas "net use" is used for connecting/disconnecting from a SMB network resource or viewing connection information. Either to use "mount" command or "net use" command would totally depend upon the type of network share that you would be mounting and would not make any difference if the enviroment is load balanced or not. Since 2008, both are capable of mounting NFS shares. But until today cannot view, edit or do anything else with SMB logon-tokens than mount a ressource. 

Install or just use the correct ADM(X) template(s) there or on another machine in this Domain. As the Screenshot indicates, this is Windows (Server) 2008, which is not able to edit registry settings like group policy preferences. 

When an application loads a dynamic link library or executeable without specifying a fully qualified path, Windows tries to locate the binary by searching a well-defined set of directories. This includes the local path, active path and the PATH variable (speaking of applications respecting that, like CMD). If an attacker gains control of one of the directories, like on a website path in IIS, they can force the application to load a malicious copy of the file instead of that it was expecting. These attacks are known as "preloading attacks" and are common to all operating systems that support dynamically loading and/or shared libraries and binaries. The effect of such attacks could be that an attacker can execute code in the context of the user (process) who is running the application. When the application pool is being run as Administrator, this could lead to a local elevation of privilege. This is why a lot of system processes do not use or no longer use the PATH contents to search for their binaries. More on this: Secure loading of libraries to prevent preloading attacks 

Interesting phenomenon. Here is what I would try - I have no idea if this really helps. If it was my machine, I would extensively watch the SMB perfcounters. One of them will show the cause. More things to try Add more Worker Threads In case the SMB_RDR obens up one write I/O Request per line (what should not happen here), it may help to add some threads to the execution engine. Set "AdditionalCriticalWorkerThreads" to 2, then to 4. 

The other possibility, in general, is that individual verification checks can be disable on a per-file or per-directory level in the spec file itself. So, while not true in this case, it is entirely possible that a packager could disable MD5 sum checking for files that are known to change for one reason or another. 

I would suggest trying bind mounts (like /Database already is) rather than the unlink/relink games that page has you play. Try something like in for /lib/modules. Alternatively, I assume your problem replacing the /lib symlink was that commands started to fail immediately after the /lib symlink was removed. That's likely because the replacement was not atomic. You might have better luck with as that should be more atomic if not, in fact, actually atomic (I don't know offhand). 

If you are already using yum to install your packages then the RPMs already exist and you could just grab the RPMs you want and store them locally for later use... or you could get a bit fancier and actually set up a local repository with your desired packages (or even the entire distribution) and use that for your servers (though if you go this route you need to be careful about getting security updates and the like if these are things that need a reasonable security status). 

If your .pem file has lines that say and then your key is in that combined .pem file and that is just fine. 

Yes and no. You are correct (barring some additional details) for server certificates. However the certificates in /etc/ssl/certs are intermediate and root CA certificates and not server certificates. That is they aren't used for server identification directly. As such they don't have that matching concern. Server certificates, the ones that servers actually present to the client, do have the matching concern and are what you see in the first certificate you get when you connect. If you look at the other certificates in the chain openssl builds (and spits out to you) you will see references to the /etc/ssl/certs style of certificates. The CN itself may not match if one of the alternate fields defined as being legal matches matches instead. Among the methods for adding additional valid names for certificate matching is the use of a subjectAltName extension with the dNSName type which then specifies what the valid name to match against is (at least for HTTPS purposes). There are others for other purposes as well.
