I think I have nailed it, what I did is very simple A call to the procedure sp_adddistpublisher was missing. 

Just complementing MartinC's answer: Instances yes, but regarding you can definitely use the following command to affect only your specific database: 

How can I produce the picture below from the xml above? the field names are static. but how would I query them? or at least if I had a starting point... 

How would I do if I had also the following tables from different to add to this publication? I want to add these two tables to the publication, how do I do it using sp_addarticle? 

This article is also very interesting: First look: back up files and folders in Resource Manager deployment 

is there any effective way to tune the query below? I have a filtered index on OrganisationID <> 0 Primary key is on another field, not relevant for this query ItemCode varchar(20). I have tagged sql server 2005 because it needs to work there, but if there is anything else in any other sql server version, please bring it up. 

The SSIS intallation is working as a charm, the only problem was that we wanted to connect to SSIS 2014 from SSMS 2012. At the end we agreed to upgrade the developers machines to sql server 2014 developer edition, and migrated the packages to sql 2014, and now everything is working fine. I will leave the question here as a reference, for the community and for myself, because at the end I had so many problems, and they all have been solved. 

I have created it on a different database file, different filegroup. This database is a subscriber, this table is highly updated. I can tell this by running the following select: 

However, I have been changing some schedules, adding extra ad hoc runs, as per the script below: (don't run this script below, it is just for illustration - you don't have the same jobs that I do here) 

This worked so fine, and I loved it, however, today I got a developer telling me about some problems, not being able to update a table. this is not working: 

I could not yet figure it out why one of my transaction replication subscription is constantly coming out with the following annoying message: The process is running and is waiting for a response from the server. Query Timeout Expired. I have tried to increase the timeout on the Log Reader Agent Profile, but it is read-only. I have also tried to create another profile and associate it with the Log Reader Agent, but it is not applied. Questions: 1) How can I change the Log Reader Agent Profile via T-SQL? That would give me the proper error message. 2) How can I find out what is causing the timeout, where is it stuck? From my previous experience, this error message disappears with time, but in this case it is not going away, and I feel that I need to change some setting, but I would like first to see clear where it is stuck, in order to assess best what exactly to change and why. 

From the replication monitor in sql server transactional replication, when I have a look at what has been replicated, from publisher to the distributor, I get the following picture: 

Basically I generate a table with random date and random values, and from that table #foo, I create the report with the help of table #bar. I have only done partition by date, not year, month or hour or minute, but I guess it could follow the same logic. everything else should be fine. 

I have created the following indexed view and its clustered index: This view was created on a subscriber database and all the tables used in the view are constantly being written to through the replication agent jobs (transaction replication). 

this has all been set up by a consultant and I am not sure if it is all right. what do I have to do to make these reports on this particular server available to my users? or at least, is there a default procedure to start troubleshooting? Below is the view of my reporting services configuration manager. the service account 

Just replace by your index name. in my example below I run it with ''which is one index that I have in only 3 of my databases and you can see the picture how it looks like. 

I have a procedure that shows me the missing indexes. It has been very good to me, but it does not show me the missing FILTERED INDEXES. I would like my procedure to be able to catch and suggest filtered indexes as well as table indexes, is this possible? this is my current procedure: 

and checked which .Net versions you have installed the problem might be in the .NET. Check the windows\applications error log. I had a similar problem (see the question here) then I installed .NET 3.5 and all started to work nicely. 

Can I expect significative gains by partitioning all these indexes according to the imageSize? On what factors would it depend mainly (in this case)? Most queries use the ImageSize as one of the parameter, it is even in the clustered index. I could modify the indexes and table structure, this take is mostly used for reading. there is only 1 write a day, and that would not normally affect many records. 

just to complement, below is a good article about the default_schema of the users, and suggestions as how to change them, however my question here has not been addressed there. Script to Set the SQL Server Database Default Schema For All Users 

in addition to the nicely put answer by remus including the link he provided How to Share Data between Stored Procedures there are situations where you get the following error messages when saving the results of a stored procedure to a table: An INSERT EXEC statement cannot be nested. The current transaction cannot be committed and cannot support operations that write to the log file. Roll back the transaction and when this happens on my own stored procedures that I develop for my own use for example a tool to tell me from a all the AD groups it belongs to and all their permissions in all databases in a server I create a temp table outside the procedure and pass its name as a parameter 

How can I get ALL the values stored in a binary(8) field? I believe there could be a combination of options in this case. 

is it at all possible? would it be worth creating a computed column, persisted, that would put the zeros and nulls together and create the index on that? is there a work around for when you want to put an OR inside a filtered index? would I not get into the same issue as below? Unable to create a Filtered Index on a Computed Column
