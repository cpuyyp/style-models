So I have a WIFI/client application which has some specific issues, in that several devices need to absolute priority. Fortunately, i'm able to prevent MOST devices from joining the network, but I need to be able to further prioritize traffic, in order to avoid interference for the main priority app. 

Am streaming UDP over wifi (5ghz) - approx 1.5k/packet... trying to stream to ~10 devices simultaneously, with extremely low latency.. As I understand Wifi, it can never true multicast, as each device holds a '1:1" relationship with the AP, and then receives the same packet... then the next device connects and gets the same packet. 

wifi transport protocols are a science-in-process, as newer protocol structures are coming online every year or two.. As to your specific question, YES, a packet response from a router TO a sender DOES carry target-specific ID info. (ie., a device (or STA, as it is generally referred to) sends a query or packet to the AP (router/access point), and the AP replies with an ACK (acknowledgement) to that STA, which contains the STA ID# and 'address'.. essentially every packet of data 'in flight' carries a small header which advise wheere it is from, where it's going, and who should care.. This becomes a bit more complicated on secure/encrypted network, but in essence the process still contains data as to who it's going to.. as to the 'multiple device' question: yes, routers may(or may not) elect to wait for a reply (thereby holding up other network traffic while waiting for a response). Much of this depends on what mode of data transport is in process: multi-cast or unicast.. multicast (MC) traffic is a single packet that's 'broadcast' out for anyone who happens to have subscribed to that particular packet address or address group. unicast (UC) traffic is to/from a single specific STA... MC traffic does NOT generally expect any sort of acknowledgement from the STA that it has received the AP's packet transport. UC traffic generally DOES expect to have an ACK reply from the STA upon receipt.. Many times ACKs are a hardware function, such that they are instantaneous, so as to minimize network delays... a further evolution in the wifi is that many newer APs now contain 2,3, or 4 radios, and each of these radios is handling a section of traffic, in essence allowing multiple 'overlapping' traffic patterns (albeit on different channels/frequencies).. It is technically speaking practically impossible for two unique data packets to 'fly' on the same exact frequency at the same exact time period, due to collision likelihood.. Therefore most wifi network structures are designed to prevent simultaneous traffic on the same channel or frequency. 

Currently we're running both 2.4 and 5ghz, are running on some ENgenius and Ruckus devices. However, I' wondering if there are different classes of APs which offer more 'under the hood' management? 

I have a small dedicated wifi network setup specifically to carry a multicast multimedia package.. no other use (no web or other data on this network, due to the arrangement).. The issue I've found is that clients are not receiving a true multicast transmission - they're actually receiving unicast from the AP. Some APs have options to "convert Multicast to Unicast", as supposedly it raises the QoS of the packet to a faster delivery.when I turn this off, the packet delay is FAR higher for any device/all devices... However, as I need to deliver the multicast to more clients (dozens), i need it to truly multicast (ie., 1 RF transmission transmitting the entire packet to dozens of clients). My clients are listening for the multicast port, but i need the AP to actually multicast/broadcast the packet.. How can this be accomplished? I've looked at various 'open source' options (OpenWRT etc), but am unsure how to actually configure APs to accomplish this. 

Trying to get my head round how best to achieve the above In essence we have s speed test server that is available in the CPE's global routing table , that we would like the customer in VRF X to test against , however due to the fact that customer X is using RFC1918 in their VRF we want to nat all LAN traffic destined to the speed server only via the WAN address ( with is public) located in global table. CPE's are ISR (881,19x1,29x1) running 15.1.4M6 Also due to the fact that we want to use this to test the speed to the broadband circuit I would if possible like to reduce the Nat effect on the cpu , but thatâ€™s is not the primary objective. in summary I am looking for a way to share the server with numerous mpls VRF that have overlapping RFC1918 addressing. is this on the right track ? 

Currently unit numbers above 16K are reserved for special purpose use only. Not possible to allow these units for regular interfaces. Please contact your Juniper SE if you need higher number available to work on a enhancement request. 

Have a look at NTOP I used this in smaller enterprise deployments to find and identify possible flow anomalies. 

a client currently has a /23 PI space where the route-object is currently managed by ISP-A we want to split the PI space into two /24's but not certain on how best to go about this. 

I have used the Cisco interface range commands on many occasions to disable a large number of switching ports when the device is originally deployed as a once off and am looking for something similar in Junos. I don't want to use apply-groups or the juniper interface-range command set as there changes are permanent and to be honest it would confuse the Tier-1 / Tier 2 staff , aka inherited config is hidden by default and therefore will likely get missed when troubleshooting. I am just looking for verification that there is no way to do this natively before I look at using slax to create a custom command. 

In essence we purchase a 80/20 line from the carrier who provides the transport between the customer premises & the local exchange where the carrier terminates into our PE. (Juniper PE) <--> [Carrier interconnect in Exchange <---> NTE in customer property] <---> (Cisco CPE - 881,1921,1941,2921)) The circuit between the customer property and the local street cabinet is still copper and therefore as the noise/distance increases the speed reduces. the actual line speed negotiation is taking place on the carriers NTE not our CPE. how can I ensure that when the link is saturated priority packets don't get dropped , without actually knowing what the line speed has authenticated to ? can something be done with ipsla ? 

When I completed SRX clustering across the EX's switches, I found the specific Juniper AppNote below quite insightful in gaining understanding of all the various requirements. 

In Junos when you use a it displays the routing tables , starting with inet.0 ( global routing table) and then listing each VRF in alphabetic order. I am after a similar command , for the following reason , new WAN deployment: remote engineer to verify VRF connectivity without plugging in the LAN, therefore I want to list the mandatory routes that are mandatory in each VRF ( e.g. 0/0 ). I know I can achieve this with but this does not display the global routing table , and that is currently used for management. in Junos I would run which would display all occurrences of the specified route in every VRF across the device including inet.0 

Okay, So I am currently trying to understand this exact problem. I understand that switches operate at level 2, therefore use MAC addresses for comms. Let's assume that the switch is connected to a router and the router has internet access, and there are two computers connected to the switch A and B. Q1. If A would like to connect to the internet, let's say connect to Google, how does it do this? Does it simply look at its ARP cache and find that it doesn't know where to find google, so looks up the MAC address for the default gateway (router) and forward this frame onto the router? If this is the case, where do IP addresses come into this, what does the router then do? Q2. Does A and B have an IP address allocated to it? If so, how does this happen? My understanding is that the router has a DHCP, but how does it know that it needs to allocate two IP addresses to A and B? Plus, as the switch is level 2 how can it handle IP addresses? I hope someone can help clear up my confusion. Thanks in advance. 

I have just had a lecture on VPNs and RADIUS and have a question with regards to authentication. I am aware of protocols such as EAP and PEAP and was wondering how these protocols work alongside RADIUS, if at all. Ultimately as the question title suggests, if a user would like to connect to a network device on an internal network using SSL VPN how would they authenticate? My initial thoughts were that the VPN server defines an authentication protocol such as EAP, the user then provides the correct credentials in accordance with the protocol and the VPN server acting as a RADIUS client forwards the data to the RADIUS server using the RADIUS protocol. The RADIUS server looks up the given credentials and if correct issues an acceptance message. The user is then authenticated and the VPN server can allow access to the network resources. I would be grateful if someone could give me some guidance. I appteciate that my initial thoughts may be completely incorrect. Thanks. 

I have recently sat in some networking lectures and have a few questions about DMZ. The example that I was given was: I have an office, in which it has a private network. In that private network, there is a database which stores all of the office's figures, as well as bank transaction details and staff details. There was a requirement for the office's headquarters to access the store's figures. The lecturer introduced DMZ, but didn't go into enough detail. Q1. Would the DMZ simply have a web server sitting within it, which would then get updated periodically by the private network's database? (only updating the web server with the store's figures of course). Or would the web server be the one querying the internal database? Pardon my ignorance here. Q2. Assuming that there were two firewalls installed in the network, Firewall 1 only allowing traffic from the Internet destined for the DMZ, and Firewall 2 only allowing traffic from the DMZ to the internal network. How would the private network have Internet access? Would Firewall 1 and Firewall 2 also be set up to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic destined for the private network? Please note, that computer networking is my weakest subject, so I apologise in advance if I have missed anything fundamental out. I am just looking to enhance my understanding of DMZ. Thanks in advance.
