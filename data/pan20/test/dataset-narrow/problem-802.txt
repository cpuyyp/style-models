It is not possible to snoop on your machine without extra software. Remote Desktop does not allow a 'view' or share - Remote Assistance does but requires you to initiate it. VNC/RAdmin etc require that you install software on your machine, and although it can be push installed from a remote location, it's not generally done, and will alert you that it is installed or that someone is using the connection. The same applies to LogMeIn and GoTomyPC Back Orifice will do exactly what you are afraid of, but is detected by even the lowliest of Antivirus products. Dameware allows surreptitious observations of a machine (most others tell you that you are being observed) and also allows the remote administrator to push the installation onto your machine as standard. The real question you should be asking is this ... If you are scared of being discovered - should you really be doing it in the first place? Is it breaking acceptable usage policies? Are your actions illegal / against your employers company interest? If so - do not be scared of doing things you could be disciplined for by SIMPLY NOT DOING IT! Of course it is also possible to identify the port your PC is connected on, set that as a monitor port and send all its traffic to a packet capture station (thats what most big corporates do in cases where monitored activity is required) There - they see everything. I have before now installed SSH on windows machines, so that I can run command line utilities such as PSLIST and PSKILL to see if people are doing things they shouldnt and stop them) So the short answer to your question is 'No, not easily' The long answer to your question is 'Yes they can monitor everything you do, the level of their monitoring will take different amounts of effort, and often the effort is too much for the end results' 

You need to do research about email reputation. Things like SPF records. Check out senderscore.com. Your smtp server ip / sending domain could be on a blacklist. Check those as well 

I have 3 servers 1 production 1 standby and 1 just sitting there. I want 1 to stay production and I have been working on setting up an MSSQL automatic failover cluster between the production server and the standby server. I require a witness server and an active directory. My question is: Can I install the MSSQL witness server on a Domain Controller? If not, WHY? This would allow me to NOT virtualize or purchase a fourth machine. Has anyone done this in a production environment? 

Most modern hard disks have a built in monitoring called S.M.A.R.T. (wiki) There are many tools for your OS that would be able to monitor that. For windows look into Active@ Hard Disk Monitor Freeware just as a starting point Your RAID controller may have built in S.M.A.R.T. monitoring as well so look there if this is for a server. 

Your last comment leads me to believe it is on the ISPs end. If your settings are correct and unchanged and a reset of the equipment does not allow for the IPs to be assigned properly then contact your ISP and tell them it is an issue. To be absolutely sure it is not you. (always best practice before accusing others) You should directly connect a machine to the internet and try to grab a few test IPs from the non working range. If you can get them assigned and working on a single directly connected machine it is more than likely your configuration. If it still is causing issues contact the ISP. Hope this points you in the right direction to determining who is at fault. If it is on your end update your post with some more info about that and what you have tried and we will try to be of more assistance. But you should first verify whose end the issue is on. If the ISP cannot handle simple ISP stuff like assigning an IP range it may be in your best interest to find a new ISP. 

The first indication that your DNS was not working, would be sporadic enterprise wide lookup failures. Note also, that almost every computer system that makes these requests, will cache the result for 30 mins or up to the records ttl value if its less than 30 mins. So careful handling of these values would be needed. 

There was also some fairly major headaches getting single sign-on working with NIS/Kerberos and all in all, I think we spent more time in support than we saved on licenses from MS From a purely non-tech point of view, the differences between Open Office files and Microsoft files caused a significant headache. I know that OO saves as MS Office files, but it just did not work in the real world. To take eMail as an example - People also get comfortable with the Outlook instantaneous update you see with exchange - not so happy with a 5 minute poll on a local IMAP / POP server. 

I used a product by Castle Rock called SNMPc - its not the most polished of tools, but it does everything that you could want and wont break the bank. Its basically an SNMP statistics collation tool, that can baseline and warn if baselines are deviated from. It can be given thresholds for growth and decline warnings and works well with any SNMP capable device. Enabling SNMP in *nix is simple, as it is within Windows. Extensibility of SNMP is quite easy too (at least on *nix) SNMP is free - there are 3 levels; all to do with security. SNMP 1 is plain text and very 'insecure'. SNMP 2 is encrypted, but its trivial. SNMP 3 uses certificates. It can be a bit of a chore getting it to work the first time though. Because there are so many counters and statistics that you can pull, it can also take a while working out which ones are right for you - but once this is done, its very straight forward. You pay for front end collation and trigger on events to make SNMP useful. You can do it with open source software, but I wanted a modicum of commercial support. Data can be polled from the devices (normal) and on critical systems, you can get the individual system to send a trap event notifying the trap manager that something went wrong, and they need to know now, and not wait for the next poll period. Polling remote devices can be done by using a collection agent - same sort of thing as the console, but without all the reporting wizardry - that then pushes the stats at the central console periodically. Of all the monitoring systems I have used, SNMP kept supplying what I was asked for, and within the budget I was given. There is a product for Microsoft Servers called MOM 'Microsoft Operations Manager' where the 5 server workgroup version is (or at least was) free... but extending it to keep an eye on enterprise systems such as Exchange and SQL could cost a lot in licenses and connectors. Beyond that - My experience is limited to SNMP, MOM, and Spotlight (by Quest) which was awesome and a bit too far beyond our budgetary range for all but the most critical of Oracle Databases. 

I am going to answer in the "What Else" Section I am not a security expert but have noticed a recent trends in viruses and malware is moving away from the PC market in general towards, Smartphones, Tablets, OSX.... 2010 was the first year that there was a noticeable drop in spam levels... This is very dangerous as more and more are users doing mobile banking and online transactions, etc... while the devices have absolutely no or very little security. To compound that the user feels immortal owning that OSX device "that can't get a virus" so they say.... But to be honest that could not be further from the truth. As for repositories of virus infected files just take a look at Symantec or AVG or any other antivirus site they all publish their signatures. Or even Google a particular malware will usually produce sites that track these sorts of things. Hope this helped you to expand your presentation a little to cover emerging targets. 

I am in the process of transitioning to exchange 2010. The current exchange server is as follows Server 2003 R2 Exchange 2003 SP2 Active Directory I would like to be able to reuse the server name for so many reasons but I must format server 2003 R2 and reinstall Server 2008 R2 as a fresh instal. This server will no longer be a DC after the transition if that makes a difference. Is it possible to keep the same server name? I can accept if that is not possible but just need a concrete answer. Some documentation on the subject is also appreciated. Info on areas I may need to clean up the old server name prior to reinstalling Server 2008 R2 is paramount. 

is this even feasible? Yes. I would suggest you look at TXT records for holding this information what are the pitfalls? Not sure how do I size the DNS servers. Not sure, but as far as I understand it DNS is a fairly low requirement service using UDP to handle requests and replies - as such it is up to the client to determine if it got an answer or not and re-ask if it was unsuccessful. 

A client of mine has been in this precise situation. He left his WiFi open to all as a gesture of good will, two months after he did, he got a warning from his ISP about his data usage, and a week after that he received a cease and desist letter from the RIAA He no longer has open WiFi. 

The only effective way to do is is with mod rewrite rules. If the referrer is not from your own domain, then rewrite the image url to be one that is non-existant, somewhere else, or a 1px by 1px transparent gif. A lot of people do this with an image that says 'No leeching, buddy' or similar 

There used to be an overriding reason to go with Linux for 64bit support (and therefore better memory management) - this is now reduced with the more stable support of x64 WIntel platforms. I cannot give you a definitive answer for why, but I looked after the IT support for a smallish development house who wrote applications against Oracle 7i, 8i, 9i and 10i - all database hosts were done vs Linux - on RHEL 3, 4 and 5. The primary reason for this was given as it was the most stable supported Host OS that Oracle ratified for use with their database. With the plethora of patches that Microsoft release, it was almost impossible to keep the host OS at a level that Oracle had tested and would support. Having used Oracle on Windows 2003 x64 and RHEL 4 x64 - the same database performed a lot better on Linux than on Windows - the back end storage was a 300Gb fibre presented raid 10 partition on an EMC array. Both systems were 'untweaked' 

I am presuming the machine with the SVN server has a connection to the network and can browse the internet. You just don't have and don't want to open up a port on the actual server. Correct? In that case: I would use VPN to get onto the network you should then be able to update your local SVN files to their newest revisions so you can view/work on them. Once finished you can commit your changes back to the server. For this you will need to setup VPN and forward the ports on the router to the VPN server. OR you could RDP to a workstation that has the files on them. Its a little less secure though. Then view/work on the files off the RDP machine.You will need to forward port 3389 or another port if you use a non standard RDP port which will increase security. 

REMOVED NON RELEVANT INFO AND EDITED SO if you are using IIS7 download the URL Rewrite Module. All the instructions and info you need are included at that link. Hope that helps. 

Here are the exact instructions modified for a domain from @K. Brian Kelley's link Open up the group policy object editor and point it to your domain group policy Under the Domains Policy, expand User Configuration, expand Administrative Templates, expand Desktop, and then click Active Desktop. Double-click Active Desktop Wallpaper. On the Setting tab, click Enabled, type the path to the desktop wallpaper that you want to use, and then click OK. Hope that helps.
