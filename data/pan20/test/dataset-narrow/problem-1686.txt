You could use and . I have never done much with bluetooth but I don't believe you need much more to get a basic connection. To get this running at boot, put the line with the path to the script in with a & to fork it to the background, e.g 

I just want to add to the above that sometimes the auto-startx line can be found in especially when dealing with touchscreen images obtained from vendors. I once was trying to disable startx and did not think of it being here. The line will before . Just change the "pi" in that line to your new username and reboot! 

If I understand your problem you want to get to raspi-config. Open a LX-Terminal and type . This will bring you to the configuration menu. Otherwise, see below. If you are talking about the "asplashscreen" try this. Navigate here: and look for the function. Then insert as the first line in the function: . Possibly, you could change these to fix your problem in config.txt. 

I've cross-compiled Qt 5.9.2 for Raspbian Stretch with the following setup: git clone -b 5.9 git://code.qt.io/qt/qt5.git cd qt5 ./init-repository ./configure -release -opengl es2 -device linux-rasp-pi2-g++ -device-option CROSS_COMPILE=~/opt/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- -sysroot ~/opt/sysroot -opensource -confirm-license -make libs -prefix /usr/local/qt5pi -extprefix ~/opt/qt5pi -hostprefix ~/opt/qt5 -v -nomake examples -nomake tests -reduce-exports -no-pch make make install No problem while configuring and building. Then I set up QtCreator (3.5.1): 

In the latest Raspbian I found the firmware-realtek package is already installed. It should provide the drivers for RTL8188EU/EE WiFi dongles. When I insert such a dongle shows: 

prepared the sd-card, copied all the libraries and application files inserted into RPi B+ and confirmed it works turned off, inserted into RPi 2 and confirmed it works turned off, inserted into RPi 3 and confirmed it works turned off, inserted into RPi B+ (or RPi 2) and now I receive a SIGILL when creating a websocket! 

and it doesn't connect. The WPA configuration is ok because pluggin in another dongle will connect in a while. What am I missing? UPDATE Output of : 

For more configuration that might help and more explanation, see this post by Adafruit about Retropie and touchscreens. Hope that helps! 

I am using Minibian(a minimal Debian based OS), and trying to set up bluetooth so that I can stream audio to a bluetooth speaker from my Pi. What are the minimum packages I need to get bluetooth working? Looking at the Official Raspbian image(which I was able to get the speaker to work with), I see these installed: 

Other questions have addressed this question but the answers above worked. I haven't had success with any of these. Does anyone know further configuration possibilities that could fix this issue? 

Surprisingly, it works to turn it on and off and so far hasn't stopped working. This is interesting because it seems like it would leave the screen in its original state because the commands appear to cancel each other out. However, running it once turns the screen off and again turns it back on again. EDIT 3 The above stopped working suddenly and would not work without a reboot. EDIT 4 I ran and and it still is not working so I know it is not an issue of using an old kernel. EDIT 5 I found a solution although I still am not sure why the above doesn't work. Instead of echoing 0 or 1 to the bl_power file I echo 0 or 255 to the brightness file which does the same thing. This has worked for over 4 hours now. It might be a hardware problem like the comment below this question. 

I don't have a lot of background services, just samba, ssh, lighttpd. I'm looking for a recommended way to mount the second partition as read-only. Most guides I find are related to Jessie and they refer to outdated files. I'm able to mount the partition as ro, but I don't know what should I do with logging and the other system features that need to write to disk. 

On startup Plymouth 0.9.2, on Raspbian Stretch, always shows the "text" theme (three square dots) regardless the current theme settings. In fact I have: 

the same audio file is played correctly on the HDMI output the same BT speaker works fine if connected to another device (i.e. smartphone) the hardware volume of the BT speaker is set to maximum value 

The *-g++ file is exactly where it's expected to be, like in the compiler configuration under Tools menu. Creating a QtQuick project leads to these other errors: 

Also had a look in and the only a line. I've called again after killing the UI but the total is still listed as 121M. Is that just an error in how the data is displayed or can the board only use 128M ? If I can only use half the memory available, is there any way to fix this ? I'm using the latest raspian wheezy and I ran apt-get update and upgrade. Is anyone else experiencing this ? I can't seem to set the video memory to 16MB( and config.txt lists as 16, but I still don't see the remaining memory as available) 

I see a total 121M listed and I have 16MB shared for video. The Raspberry Pi I'm using has a chip and I expected to see something around 240M instead of 121M because the board should have 256M. Here is the output: 

The problem is python freezes when I use , (expecting or ), Any suggestions ? I'm using Raspian Wheezy UPDATE I've tried lenik's suggestion(using the timeout parameter) and it did help: with timeout 0 the program no longer freezes. However I can getting nothing back. I've tried some other approaches: installing openframeworks and modifying the serialExample but again, not errors, but no data: just silence. Eventually I've managed to get Processing 1.5.1 as well running, slow though, with the serial library (hacky .so and .jar replacing was needed), but yet again, no mesages. I'm starting to think there's some sort of user limitation, output being piped somewhere else or something. I'm new to linux so a bit lost a the moment. How can I read values from a serial port on the Raspberry PI ? Thanks! 

Apologizes for the object, but I cannot easily summarize the scenario. I created an sd-card based upon Raspbian Stretch Lite, with some customization. Then I cross-compiled Qt5.9 and copied the libraries to the target. I used the mkspec for RPi 1, in order to get an executable compatibles with all models. How I tested it: 

I found other questions similar to mine but without a working answer. On RPi3 with Raspbian Stretch I'm trying to connect to a Bluetooth speaker. It connects but I have no audio output. 

In my application an RPi could be powered for months and then suddenly shutdown (removing the power supply, without halting the o.s. which is in read-only). On reboot Internet might not be available and I want to be sure the rtc has the most recent time, not the one set manually or on startup. 

Now my application works only on RPi 3! Does running it in a newer model might affect compatibility on the previous ones? 

I have a 3.5in touchscreen attached to the GPIO of my B+. Most windows you can double click the decorations to resize to fit the screen. However, some windows have that feature disabled(at least via the GUI) and are too big to drag. Because of this problem I can't do certain things because I cannot reach the OK button! So my question is, is there a supported way in python or a bash script I could use to force the window size to be within the limits of the screen? Of is there a setting I am unaware of in the GUI? I cannot find anything on this subject. I would prefer a solution that does not require a new installation(for example wmiface). 

After letting the board alone it still would not work. Moral of the story: if you are powering your pi over the 5v rail be very careful and don't assume anything. 

I've split channels, deleted one and saved the same wav file as mono and the sound plays but I head a pop at the start and end of playback and get this message: 

I followed this guide to emulate RPI on OSX via VirtualBox and it works. Now I'd like to simplify things a bit since this solution involves running debian in a virtual machine just to run qemu on top of. I googled for guides on how to setup qemu straight on osx and found Matthew Yee-King's guide. I followed the instructions and all seems fine until the last part. When I launch I see the QEMU window appear but the application seems to freeze. After a while it appears as Not Responding in Activity Manager. What am I missing ? How do I emulate RPI on OSX with QEMU ? 

but I'm still having I've only managed to play a mono wav file (less than 500KB in I couldn't play a 44100 Hz, 16bit, stereo file, got this error: 

I'm following this guide to set up the rtc module in Raspbian Stretch. First question: after the changes described, the RPi doesn't sync anymore with the actual time from the Internet. Second question: how is handled the sync between system and ds1307 clock? The guide says: 

Here is explained how to gain access to the peripheral without being root. I've just tried in my environment (Raspbian Stretch, RPi2, Qt5.9) in this way: 

I know the procedure to enable an external RTC, but I just wonder which are the available supported chip (in config.txt and to use with modprobe). Where can I find such a list? 

I've done this a lot of times in these years. But now, when I create a new QWidget project I get this error: 

I'm looking for a webserver to configure the network using the AP that works with the latest Raspbian Stretch. If I'm not wrong these projects rely on the old name scheme: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

I have my raspberry pi connected to my router and a laptop also connected to the router. I can SSH to the pi from the laptop perfectly. However, when I try to install something it says "". When I try to ping google I get a 100% packet loss rate. My Ethernet light is blinking as if data were being transmitted though and when I run i get a message saying its already configured. My file has my router's ip as a nameserver and my interfaces file is set up for . shows my eth0 with an IP of 192.168.0.9. This is a fresh install of Minibian(basically Rasbian but without extra features.) I also tried it with Rasbian and had the same issue. What could the issue be? 

The HC-SR04 can only be run with 5v(scroll down to specs). However, you can easily fix your problem if you have a breadboard. Assign one row as the 5v "rail" and attach as many sensors as needed. EDIT: How to use breadboard. Basically, the two long rows on the each side of the board can be used as rails for power supply. Just make sure you keep your 5v rail separate from you ground rail(5v is usually marked red on breadboard to help). You could also just use one of the many rows. The picture below shows how they are connected. Dedicate one row to 5v. So, a pin from 5v goes to that row and then the rest of the holes are now 5v and can be used for the sensors!
