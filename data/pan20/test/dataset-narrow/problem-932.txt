You could use for unsetting (or setting) environment variables: "The env utility executes another utility after modifying the environment as specified on the command line." 

The quotes will make (etc.) the command name - with spaces and parameters as parts of the executable file name - which does not exist. 

Best thing is: this won't modify your current execution environment. (Edit: apparently is a FreeBSD extension... please let us know if this works under Linux, too!) 

Correctness of results is the limit. When starting to overclock, some combinatorial circuit won't complete its operations in time any more, but only with some operands (e.g. an adder when carrying "1" bits)... but the sequential logic systems will still use the "intermediate" result. With moderate overclocking, usually it still looks as if would be working fine, but only until critical operands meet! Some computations will start to yield incorrect results, with arbitrary effects to your data (including corruption of data, or even total data loss). 

Translate-shell Translate-shell use different online translation services... we could integrate the whole application or some of it's source to provide translation to goldendict. $URL$ Quick Solution Using Translate-Shell GoldenDict have a feature in the dictionary settings section so an easy way to add an online translation feature would be to use one of those two command line tools or the python script As an example of French/English translation with google under Program section we would just add 

Explanation : The network card are activated just after their drivers are loaded and startup of network service, so pretty early in the windows boot sequence, exposing windows to potential network risks for those who use third party firewall. (because most firewalls load after windows login) 

Proxychains Bug/Incompatibility : There is a bug with chrome caused apparently by the sandbox feature; check Issue 45 Proxychains Limit : Proxychains could have leaks in many situations here are some of them as example 

...should list the files, you can pass the output to yourself (I'm not writing the here to encourage you to double-check the list of files). You might need instead of the backquotes if there are too many files in the current directory. 

While it's probably legal to match the SSID, it appears quite risky to me. If someone decides to provide an "open evil twin" network, it can backfire in at least two ways: 

You can use for steps 2+3, for step 4, and again for step 2+5. The parameters for might appear a little complex at first - but you can always test with first. 

This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell program (...) Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that COMMAND is presented to rsync as a single argument. 

As a start, it it quite difficult to determine if a page actually is blank. For example, there might be objects visible outside of the PDF box of your choice (like trimming marks), or object layers which can be switched on/off conditionally. For a programmatic solution, you could either 

Note : I also had this problem after upgrading to Win 10 from 8.1 and i figure it out; My mistake was disabling some new services brought with win 10 or services that were disabled on my win 8 installation. Solution : Check if the service "NetSetupSvc" is started and set to "manual start" (default) and not disabled. 

How to disable the network cards during windows boot Purpose : Avoid network leaks that can happen before the firewall is active 

How to add online dictionaries feature (mainly google translator) for GoldenDict Right now a discussed solution is in html with an iframe 

You can also check from the service manager (my system is in french the service is named : "Service Configuration du rÃ©seau") Alternative Solution : Check the windows logs while you opening the network card properties to track where the problem is coming from ;) 

Enable add-on debugging, load your add-on temporarily and voila you have a button available for reloading it as you make modification to JS/CSS/Etc. 

will ignore any subdirectory "admin", e.g. /Users/admin - on a Mac. Please check if your target system supports the option (). You might probably have to use instead, if the target system has a GNU coreutils . 

No. The recycle bin functionality is part of the , and will be used only if you choose to remove files via Finder. Console commands (such as ) will bypass the recycle bin. There might be some file system level utilities to get files back, if (and only if) the space hasn't been overwritten yet... but there are no builtin tools I know of. I'd recommend to use your last backup. 

Yes, one may have both directories and (sym-)links in a tar file: see Tar Format Documentation. In this case, one would have an archived structure, but no file content in the tar archive. 

A little bit like this: $URL$ You boot Linux from the Live CD (not using it as a replacement boot loader, but booting into the Live CD installation). Then mount the partition containing of your hard disk installation, similar to the tutorial. Stop before doing ! Just the the directory where you mounted it, enter , for good measure (in case your cat jumps on the keyboard one moment later) and . 

The project $URL$ tried to do that conversion but the developer seems to have abandoned the idea BDC files are encrypted and proprietary files so it's even illegal to convert them What i advice you is to search google with the file you want to convert and add bgl to your search request, you will probably find what you look for because most dictionary are old and they have been in bgl format before being distributed as bdc Also there is a huge catalog of free bdc dic on $URL$ i guess you will find most of your bdc there in bgl format. 

First you could edit your keymap file to change the behavior of the power button to assign it to an other key Edit the file : (edit POWR key) Then you will need to disable the power button efficiently a good method is with xinput run power buttons have their own entry... pick the device number then run something like 

Software can access the screen content by other means than by using an optical device (when making a "screenshot" this becomes obvious). This technology exists some decades now, and as you correctly say, might be used for spying. But, there is no camera involved. Added - quoting Wikipedia: 

Might be related to sudo credential caching on by default - check and try to edit the file to change this behavior. 

Deactivate "Reverse Polish Notation" in the menu :) Otherwise you have to enter "10 Enter 20 +" to get 30. It's operating with a stack in RPN mode. To be fair, there is a kind of bug in RPN mode - pressing "+" with only one operand on the stack should have signaled an error to you (as "+" operation in RPN is defined as fetching two operands from stack, adding them, and pushing the result back on the stack). HP calculators would not allow this. 

Alternative Solution For Desktop (KDE) : We can watch a a service with the Applet/Widget Server Status... after installing it just add a command into the widget to monitor your service Example : KDE 4 Version : $URL$ KDE 5 Version : $URL$ 

A possible Solution would consist of disabling the network cards on an early boot stage like BootExecute but the problem with this solution is that it require a native application to do the job and it's not easy to get it done as native functions are not documented Solution : The idea is to disable the driver to avoid it's activation at boot... after the system complete boot, a scheduled task will enable the driver, load it, and set it to disable for future reboot while keeping it active and loaded at the current time Solution Diagram : (ND = Network Driver) ND Disabled --> Boot --> Desktop --> ND Enabled --> ND Loaded --> ND Disabled (But still loaded) Solution Application : The application consist of 2 scheduled scripts one run before the windows login (at startup) the other run after windows login (desktop) the reason of having 2 scripts is to avoid device detection error Scheduled Task Script (Before logon) : 

The canonical way is to use with your id (typical: mail address) for . Documentation says that's the way to to "encrypt-to-self". 

With this in mind, you could just put up "free WLAN" signs to attract other (anonymous) users. This might make the rogue access point operator think twice :) 

others could simply use it (with strong crypto) and exhaust monthly data quota/trigger speed throttling, unknown users could use it for illegal things (file sharing, sending blackmail letters, whatever), which would be traced back to the "evil twin" operator. 

Maybe some heavy machine nearby ramping up at that time? Have seen a similar effect with a tomography machine used for research. Do you know if that happens on weekend days, too? 

The default shell for this user (not the current shell) will be used. Have a look at - it's defined there, and will be launched at login. You can use to change the current user's default shell.
