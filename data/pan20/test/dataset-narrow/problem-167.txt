NMAP uses quite a number of observable features to guess a device's operating system and details. Easily seen for local hosts is the ethernet address, which has 24-bit Organisationally Unique Identifier. However, these are only available for local hosts and also can be faked by many methods, and tell you very little more than the manufacturer. So NMAP uses many other things as well, which the operating system usually choose, such as settings for ID fields, flags and so on, and users have over time collected the fingerprints of many different operating systems. A few manufacturers contribute also. From NMAP's manual page: 

You pretty much have to have subnet per VLAN, as inter-VLAN traffic has to go through L3 routing, either at your switches or a router. Just curious: why do the VLANs have to communicate with each other? 

You have them all correct. 5th fragment: remember that the routers can change their settings at any time, and the fragmentation limit can change from one packet to the next. When you fragment already fragmented packets, you normally see something like this: 

It's not simply syntactic, in as much as there are networking situations which can be written with netmasks which cannot be written with CIDR notation, the "nonconsecutive networks" which are thankfully hardly ever used. A non-consecutive netmask is something like 255.255.127.0, which doesn't fit the pattern for good netmasks, which all have N ones followed by (32-N) zeros. If you find yourself wanting to use these "wacky netmasks", talk yourself out of it. They violate all current presumptions about how things work, and violate any number of standards. The only real reason for knowing about them is so that you know that certain mistakes are possible with netmask notation which are impossible to write in CIDR. CIDR is really a much better way of expressing the network size. It conveys the right information in a concise way. 

The various regional internet registries have varying policies for bulk whois. I know that RIPE has rate limiting for personal information; and may well have for queries in general. You might find that one of RIPE's other interfaces is better suited for what you're doing, as it has many APIs, not just conventional whois. See $URL$ EDIT: RIPE is pretty clear about its policies and limits, see its Query Reference Manual, and Acceptable Use Policy, which give the details. 

You'll need to have a hostname and a domain and generate the keys for ssh to work. My notebook says: 

The main thing outstanding is how to get a Cisco to give anything like a post-decryption packet dump (monitor capture appears only able to get pre-decryption info) from the SSH process. Without this, all we see is the Cisco complaint "other side sent wrong thing", which leads to a finger-pointing game between suppliers rather than resolution. Thanks if anyone has a better suggestion. [EDIT 2017-10-26] Case opened at Cisco TAC yesterday and two hours of phone calls are starting to get somewhere. 

If NAT-T is enabled and client is behind NAT, then NAT-T is used no NAT exists, then Native IPsec (ESP) is used So not gonna affect your current tunnels. 

That's correct you need to have support of dot1q on Dlink to be able implement router on stick. Ideal solution would be intervlan routing on switch but yours 2950 is layer 2 device, router on the stick isn't preffered solution. 

You will encounter overruns. Which indicate number of times receiver hardware wasn't able to deliver received data into a hardware buffer. Usually hardware buffer is is shared with other ports for example ports 1-8 share same buffer and ASIC. In some switches models if ASIC buffer is overload than data is queued to general buffer but this is causing what we calling punting and slows down whole switch as packets need to be processed by CPU. packets which would not fit into hardware or general buffer will be dropped. But in your scenario wouldn't really be a issue. Issue is when you have more traffic than backplane could handle. 

If destination hosts is sending echo replay response and is not recived by sender. There could be two common issues: 

Is is possible to setup site to site ipsec tunnel on two ASA with certificate authentication without available certificate authority for both ASA. As per guide from: Cisco site Certificate authority is required. Anyone could help with some materials, guides etc? Business need is to eliminate PSK. 

You can configure an interface to convert the dynamic MAC addresses to sticky secure MAC addresses and to add them to the running configuration by enabling sticky learning. To enable sticky learning, enter the switchport port-security mac-address sticky command. When you enter this command, the interface converts all the dynamic secure MAC addresses, including those that were dynamically learned before sticky learning was enabled, to sticky secure MAC addresses. The sticky secure MAC addresses do not automatically become part of the configuration file, which is the startup configuration used each time the switch restarts. If you save the sticky secure MAC addresses in the configuration file, when the switch restarts, the interface does not need to relearn these addresses. If you do not save the configuration, they are lost. So they wont be ageing from port security, mac address only ageing from CAM and ARP. Port security and ARP table are two different concepts. 

You can't measure these statistics by sniffing traffic because most of packets would normally pass thru OSI layer 7 and response could be delayed due to application responding slowly and many other factors. As Ron mentioned you can use IP SLA and draw graphs for example in Cacti or nProbe, NTOP could be as well used to collect jitter statistics. Netflow would be good source of information. For very simple measurments you can use tools like mtr. 

IP address 10.150.174.20/17 is part of 10.150.128.0/17 network. First valid host: 10.150.128.1 Last valid host: 10.150.255.254 Broadcast: 10.150.255.255 

I suppose these and similar all come under the general idea that those responsible for networking might not have responsibility for servers but might nonetheless have to make the networks function. Jonathan 

If you have a need for say, four interfaces with 192.168.0.1/24 through 192.168.3.1/24 on them, with routing and access control lists, NAT, etc, then there are a couple of common approaches. Use lots of L3 interfaces in the obvious way 

I have a Cisco 867VAE with 15.5(3)M which is disconnecting from a particular legitimate SSH client with It's on a bench, not in service. I have full control over the Cisco R1 not much over the client. 

I presume you don't mean a site-to-site VPN such as from a small office to HQ, which would normally be WPA2 to the access point, then encrypted in the tunnel to HQ. A VPN on your laptop will be tunnelled before the wifi, so what the eavesdropper sees is lots of WPA2 packets from your laptop to VPN peer. It will be encrypted ONLY if the VPN is set to use encryption. Most are, but many are just for addressing convenience. In many kinds of laptop-based VPN, encryption is an option, which you need to make sure is enabled. While I'm here: many don't know that one kind of "encryption" available in HTTPS is "NULL" -- all the trappings of SSL are there but there isn't any encryption. (Eg look up aNULL and eNULL in Apache SSL configs.) Most web servers are set up to use good encryption only, but if they made a mistake, and your laptop negotiates NULL encryption then the data is naked. So you could have WPA2, a VPN from your laptop and be on an HTTPS web site and still have no (practical) encryption. The truth is often an empirical matter: packet sniffing on your laptop before and after the VPN is sometimes the only way to tell. 

EDIT: config attached. It's a bench config in order to narrow down this problem for units in the field. 

You sometimes will see things like "peak throughput" and "average sustained throughput" which I'd regard as very helpful. Very often the rates that are interesting depend entirely on the period you average over. PS IEC prefixes kibi, mebi, etc are far from universally used but worth knowing about 

It's not usually possible to see if there's a switch between A and B, unless you have a candidate switch: then you can disable/reenable sockets and see what happens to link status. 

Choosing between these approaches depends on the hardware you've got. There are sometimes performance complexities or subtle restrictions eg max ether HWICs for a chassis. My understanding is that some Cisco L3-capable interfaces can be put into L2 mode, and they enter this by the command; but some require "subinterfaces", see below. A structure which is extremely common is sometimes called "router on a stick". A router is configured with one L3 towards internet, and one set as a trunk port towards a switch. The switch has many VLANs; the router has many lines. Note also the so-called "Layer 3 Switch", which is a switch with a router in it that can be enabled in configuration. The difference between a router with a switch in it and a switch with a router in it is mostly one of engineering emphasis; for many purposes it's just a question of which has got the interfaces you want, and perhaps the routing protocols and higher level functions. 

Split traffic based on users You have three sons in their teens who game like idiots. They use so much bandwidth that you decide to take a second high speed cable connection. You buy a nice Draytek router that can handle two internet connections into one network, and which can decide which computer connects to what network, based on a set of rules. Now you have the following situation: 

These are several situations and questions I can think of now. There are probably many more. What I want is a good picture of where we're standing now, and what we can expect to happen when this shortage becomes worldwide. 

Home network: if my router is IPv6 ready, will it translate to IPv4 for devices that don't understand IPv6? Can these home devices still use IPv4 when the rest of the home network is IPv4? For sites that are still IPv4 only, will my computer or router switch automatically? When I open whatismyip.com, I see an IPv4 address. I believe I can ask my provider to change to IPv6, but I guess that will disable large parts of the internet for me - will it? Can I still send mail, will DNS work? When my provider changes to IPv6, will I still have an IPv4 address? Does this have consequenses for TLS certificates? With IPv6 NAT is obsolete I understand. Will this mean my wifi enabled tv is directly accessible from the outside? I guess the router firewall is still working, but now we can use a direct address from the outside? I don't live in Latin America and don't use Azure. But what if I go to Brasil right now. Will I notice it? Is there an easy way to test what works and what not without messing up the home network? 

Today I read that Microsoft has no more IPv4 addresses for its Azure cloud. Earlier this week I read that Latin America is out of IPv4 addresses as well. These are real - not predicted - IPv4 address shortages. I remember we had IPv6 day two years ago, but since then I haven't heard much about IPv6 in the news. I would like to have a good understanding of what the change to IPv6 really means, and where we can expect problems. Current situation 

Split traffic based on type of usage So far nothing new, and this is comparable with two different households, one of them with a fast connection. But now you change the setup of the router, and based on the kind of traffic or the kind of websites that are used, you decide to use ADSL or cable. 

Given enough users, ADSL will feel "throttled". In fact it is not throttled, it's just a slower channel. Given enough speed, cable will never feel throttled. So traffic is not throttled, it's just directed through a channel that cannot handle the speed that you would expect, compared to using cable. Why is this bad You may think that this is not such a bad thing. In my example I'm talking about Facebook and Gmail going through the slow connection. That will not happen. Facebook will pay for speed, just like Google and Microsoft. They have the money. Small firms and sites don't have that money. They will not pay, visitors get annoyed with the slow connection, and stay away. When I google for something like sneakers, I will click several links. Some will take 20-30 seconds to open and before that the page is blank. Many times I close the tab and choose another link. This will get worse. Facebook has its own server farms that serve superfast. I use a cheapass 10 euro a year provider and just one wordpress page can take 30 seconds depending on other traffic on that server. To be honest I still don't see how this is different, and I don't know what the side effects will be. So I can't tell you why this will be more problematic than using (and paying for) a fast or slow server. 

IMHO I assume that lidgren is working on Layer 7 (application layer). Which would increase CPU overhead and latency. Packets are still handled as normal by lower layers supported by operating system, as Lidgren don't change how UDP is handled by operating system. So to process additional checks on higher layer it would take time and use additional resources. Not really sure but maybe lidgren is adding additional headers in data which are handled by application and to process this you need CPU and is where latency could increase. 

There is need for output and input rules. A stateless firewall filter, also known as an access control list (ACL), does not statefully inspect traffic. Instead, it evaluates packet contents statically and does not keep track of the state of network connections. In contrast, a stateful firewall filter uses connection state information derived from other applications and past communications in the data flow to make dynamic control decisions. 

Switch uses Layer 2 Spanning Tree Protocol to ensures a loop free topology for any bridged Ethernet network. So if yours IOT device will forward bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) accross, switch will maintain loop free topology. BPDU are transsmited accross local network to detect loops in network topologies. If BPDU won't be forwarded you can possibly have a loop. But effect of STP could be something like on this picture. So two IOT boards would be able only to talk with DHCP server thru another IOT board. 

Of course it does, it route packets from A to B. Usually home routers only have a default route, but this doesn't mean that they don't route packets. Their routing table is just smaller with one default route and few directly connected interfaces. 

In IP world Explicit Congestion Notification would kick in. All about ECN you can find in RFC3168 or Wikipedia 

protect —The PFC drops packets with unknown source addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value. so answer is no you don't need shutdown and re-enable port, after 10 minutes mac address will age out from port protected and new mac address will be assigned in case of using sticky. You can add to aging type {absolute | inactivity} For absolute aging, all the secure addresses on this port ago out exactly after the time (minutes) specified and are removed from the secure address list. For inactive aging, the secure addresses on this port ago out only if there is no data traffic from the secure source address for the specified time period. 

You can use source and destination filter in wireshark: ip.src==192.168.0.1 and ip.dst==192.168.0.2 if it's http you can add filter: tcp.port == 80 or tcp.port == 443 for ssl. When you find your stream you can click "Follow TCP Stream". You can compare time of failed download and apply time filter to narrow yours search. Unfortunately there is no way to filter failed download unless you know reason for fail or some additional information.
