Alternatively, you could try writing an app to help you out (in the onCreate()) have not tested in Android things though: 

I have the following code which I use to run some DC motors on the Raspberry Pi with an L293D H-Bridge. I should be able to control which motor is driven and in which direction. 

This kind of data is heavy. You better be able to store a LOT of information Perhaps work with averages over some shorter time rather than a single value. I use an average over 5 minutes, so if my sensor is initialising, I don't trust the -1000ºc that it sends me. Averages are better anyway, especially if you are going to be raising alarms and get people up late at night. Do what you need for the project. Over engineering and hard policy decisions will ultimately hurt you (e.g. we MUST use RF, or we MUST use Arduino's / ESP8266 boards) because if you can't adapt to the problem, you'll try hacking too much and end up with a mess. Tackle one problem at a time. Get the sensor data, then work on comms, etc. etc. 

Looking at the documentation and your code it looks like you may not have called the SETUP method correctly: 

What I recommend is that you time the gif's so they only play once, since they seem to repeat, also they are different lengths so you want to make the delay a variable. Here is a basic solution: 

Have a look at this video. On the back of your screen there should be a model number - you'll just need to find the right controller for that screen's model number. You should be able to order it from eBay and that will become the adapter to an HDMI cable for your Raspberry Pi. 

I use a DS18B20 sensor rigged up to a ESP8266 (Arduino Wifi compatible board). Then I hooked up the ESP8266 to the Wifi and called web services to upload the temperature data to an endpoint (IFTTT) that loads it in a Google spreadsheet. I have also done this on a production system (with more sophisticated hardware and a C# back-end) that was used to monitor the temperature of fruit in a refrigeration unit and it also was online, rather than using RF. Here is a Fritzing diagram describing how the temperature sensor is hooked up: 

This is presuming the LCD is attached by DSI ribbon cable. That should also rotate the touch coordinates too. 1 = 90° 2 = 180° 3 = 270° $URL$ 

There is usually a small icon that appears in the top right corner for overheating (and another for under-voltage) 

Then select Interfaces > SSH Enable SSH and reboot. Use a LAN scanner on your phone (Fing) to locate the IP and check the services that are running. 

I'd suggest a USB to LAN adapter (very cheap on eBay) and set static IP addresses on both devices. Or the hotspot method mentioned above. Or - use a smartphone with hotspot, Fing (to scan for the R-Pi IP and scan running services) and JuiceSSH (for the SSH bit) 

Use SD Formatter to clear the card as this also checks to confirm that the card is not corrupted. If it keeps saying that it needs formatting then it's time to scrap it and start again. 

If you haven't already changed the default password and disconnected from the Internet, start there. If the scrot captures continue check /etc/rc.local for odd entries. 

Set up a pihole and don't use either of the ISP DNS servers, while blocking ads, malware and telemetry. This can then also be used to protect other devices in your network. 

Keep it simple and prove your project is worth the effort of a UPS. Just add a momentary switch to short a couple of GPIOs that triggers a shutdown. The Pi will power up when the car is started next time. Be wary your supply is only delivered after the engine has started, to prevent a dip during the ignition process. Create a script: 

$URL$ the IR modules are very cheap on eBay and could be powered either from the R-Pi or a standalone battery. 

Force the screen to stay on: From an SSH session in PuttySSH or a terminal session on the Raspberry Pi itself: 

I've tried only setting the WAN DNS to the Pihole and leaving the DHCP to the Fritz. Unless static IP and DNS is set, network device requests show as coming from the Fritz. 

It looks to me like you are not assigning your array values. Change your read_temp method to use the index you give it. 

where *** is the name of the deb file, as mentioned in this answer Since there are thousands of deb packages, you'll have to find the required ones for pixel in some of these lists: 

Launch Remote Desktop Connection which can be found at Start->All Programs->Accessories->Remote Desktop Connection Type in the IP Address for your Pi which you noted above. Click Connect (you may get a security warning at this stage just click OK if you do. After all it is your Pi on your network so nothing to worry about security wise). Leave the Module on the default of sesman-Xvnc and enter your username and password for your Pi. (The default is pi and raspberry if you haven't changed them). Click OK and after a few moments you should be greeted my your Raspberry Pi's desktop! 

So I have achieved this by creating a Raspberry Pi Bluetooth Low Energy Peripheral device. The code is on Github for the Raspberry Pi peripheral and for the accompanying Android app. Just make sure your raspberry pi is up to date. Raspberry Pi Bluetooth Ble Peripheral with Bleno: 

I may be wrong there, it could just be formatting on the question (your if's CONTENTS required no indentation). 

to find out your I.P. This is the address of your Pi on your network and what we will use to connect to your Pi from the second machine. ON THE REMOTE COMPUTER 

And you will get the latest version of Pixel. You don't download it separately from Raspbian (Stretch, Jessie or otherwise) More on this can be found on the Wikipedia entry for Raspbian. EDIT Since the question has been edited to clarify that the Pi has no internet connection, I will edit this answer. To install components offline you need to find the .deb and transfer it to 

Now we have xte, which can simulate the movement of the mouse and keyboard keypress Examples of xte usage Move the cursor to the point x = 10 and y = 20 on the screen grid 

Install xautomation. Add kiosk.sh to the autostart file and have it launch chromium-browser to a specific page, login and go full screen. Examples of key pushes are included. 

Replace the SD card. Always have a spare with a known working OS. They aren't expensive and it doesn't have to be large or with a fast read/write speed (class 4 or 6 is fine to test) 

I'm trying to configure the DNS settings of a Fritz!box 3490 so that the host names are revealed in Pihole. 

Use the package piclone, it's installed by default on the full Raspbian image. Great way to build, tweak, clean up and backup an installation. A 16GB SD card with Raspbian can be striped to less than 8GB and then written to an 8GB SD card. I've got images down to 4GB and used a 4GB card to receive the backup clone. The card can then be read to an IMG file on a PC using Win32diskimager. 

Not quite sure what you are trying to achieve so here is a script that uses pull with explanations, maybe it'll help. 

Use the package piclone. It will copy the current running system to SD which can then be backed up to your PC using win32diskimager. Hint: remove as much stuff that you don't use in the running image as possible to get the backup file size small. Use as small an SD that you can to keep your back up files small, also reducing image read and write in the future. Hint 2: expand the partition on any backup SD cards as this isn't automatic. 

It's fine. I've done it on loads. There is nothing it fouls. Don't go too large with the bolt head. I opened mine to 3.8mm. Old post about opening up the holes 

Open up a terminal and type Log into your Pi from your laptop with the default username 'pi' and password 'raspberry' 

And my code (simply) is like below. You can check out the sub project as well but that has other stuff in it like hosting it's own web site and displaying on a Nokia 5110 screen. 

It's unlikely that your phone would adhere to a Sony standard, so type 3 is not really worth considering. But you need to remember that the NFC reader is looking for a Tag to read from or write. So the question is, are you just tapping your phone hoping it will read / write something, or are you emulating or transmitting a "tag" for your hardware to read? I would recommend researching Host Card Emulation. Or you can use vsmartcard's solution to test, just make sure about the protocol and tag types. I think you should also install NFC tools and check that your phone is capable of reading the same tags as your hardware. Remember your phone can be both "tag" and "reader" so there will be some setup involved in getting it right. Perhaps Android Beam would be the best way to be in a "tag" like state. 

What you would need to do is utilise a socket. A socket allows a server and client to communicate directly with an ongoing connection. The advantage of this is fairly high. Let's say you want a user interface on the Raspberry Pi, you'll find most interfaces are fairly lacking. Except on of course: HTML. This pretty much sounds like what you want. You have a server which presents a UI, as well as a socket that can communicate directly with the pages. Then you can even allow the pages to give feedback to the server, or simply allow the server to react to physical elements like a button push and then inform the sockets of a state change. 

Unfortunately, this doesn't work. Even though it seems to be replicated in many tutorials and blogs. However if I take the GROUND from the 6v and attach it to the 5v of the Pi, my creation can't go fast enough:
