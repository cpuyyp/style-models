The firefox url bar has some of auto-prediction built-in. Whenever I try to write something the auto-prediction kicks in. I do end up killing a few of the entries using shift+delete . But is there a way to en-masse kick the links ? 

The only sha1sum (seems no sha256sum) for MS-Windows was done by one of the GNUPG people way back in 2004. See $URL$ and the binary can be seen browsed/looked at ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/ With github and such public-facing repositories has somebody superseded that release. I am looking for a tool which is able to check hashes of any .iso image or just plain applications, provided hashes have been provided by the .iso provider to check them against. In Unix I can simply do :- 

I'm certain it's a big simplification, so correct me if I'm wrong here. What I Tried I configured /boot/loader.conf with the few basic settings, and I'm most sure that this file is okay. The other 2 were more puzzling. I tried to make a network package in wpa_supplicant.conf. I found the ssid of the router, but the security wasn't so easy. The routers configuration on security is set to "Auto", with no explanation given. Other options are there, but Auto is selected. Another laptop uses WEP to connect (it's Vista, so I don't know how to get any more info than that), but I never configured it to do it. There's a string labled "wireless key" on the bottom of the router which I entered to set it up a new machine on the network (Windows and Macs, so it was simplified). I never had to choose a security type and only learned about them by installing FreeBSD. So perhaps WEP is what "Auto" means, but I can't find any other evidence. wpa_supplicant.conf seemed to never be correctly configured. I always got errors related to it and WPA_supplicant doesn't work. It gave me "Can't disable/enable WPA in the driver" errors and more once when I enabled -d -d. This was when I was trying some suspect configurations in rc.conf though. Usually it does nothing except hijack the shell and print "CTRL-SCAN-EVENT-RESULT" every 10 seconds. I learned how to clone the ath0 device to a wlandev interface (wlan0). ath0 is associated to it and their connection seems to go smoothly. But the wlan0's connection to the network is the problem. I couldn't create this with rc.conf, I do something wrong and get ifconfig: create: bad value errors whenever it's parsed. I did it via the shell instead. What Now? I scanned with wlan0 today: ifconfig wlan0 list scan It shows my router, even my neighbour's router. It was a relief to finally get some feedback. So wlan0 is UP and detects the router, but it is always status: no carrier. It can't associate with it and I can't figure out why. Running /etc/rc.d/netif start returns almost the same result as ifconfig would. It shows lo0 and wlan0, and sometimes ath0. I still not sure what lo0 is doing. So; how do I associate with it? We can assume it's WEP security based on how the other laptop is setup. I'll give every relevant output here. After boot, with a blank rc.conf this is what ifconfig returns: 

I have tried it two times already and each time I hit some or the other road-block. AFAIU it, both Windows 10 and any GNU/Linux say Debian can live each happily with each other. Now I have a 4 TB HDD put as a gpt disk. Now when I do install the OS, I do it this way - a. Windows 10 with /boot f. After Windows Installation is all done, then install debian and use grub2 so it finds both the distros. and do the best it can. Now with Linux, it is easy mapping out the needs - a. grub2 shows something like this - 

Wanted to know if people know of any major differences between identify --verbose and exiftool. A picture here :- 

This creates a tarball of the 2 files file1 and file2. As i said earlier you can throw things at the tarball and it will still be fine! 

The drivers are currently in no state to be called anything but beta drivers. The support is abysmal. However, reinstall them using these methods. But before you do, make sure you purge the current drivers using: 

The main reason for keeping AHCI on when you use a SSD to install windows is to instruct the OS to run its TRIM command. Once this has been activated windows will continue to run the TRIM command. My current set up is similar to yours, if not identical in implementation. I have a 6Gb/s Intel 830 128 gb SSD which i installed windows 8 on using AHCI. Trim is currently running. I have 2 x 320gb HDs in RAID 0 as well. My current BIOS setting for Hard drive orientation is RAID, this is so that it sets up the array each time. You can even keep other singular drives on the other SATA controllers, you need to actually specify the drives used in RAID for them to be so. Therefore to answer your question, no they won't affect it at all. The RAID setting in the BIOS just informs the controller that it needs to set up and maintain a specific array that needs to be defined in the RAID BIOS(yes the controller has its own BIOS). For reference i leave my BIOS mode in RAID. Hope this helps, i can answer any other specific questions you have as i have had considerable experience with RAID 

I have a lenovo t-440. I have had seizures and now can't remember what I used to do in order to have function keys behave as I like/want them to be. For instance on all my desktops its CTRL+ALT+Fn$` in order to get to a germinal shell One method which is shared by people here is Make function keys behave as normal on a Lenovo laptop but that's not the method AFAI remember that I used. Does anybody know fo any alternate methodology for the same. 

And provided I have hash checksum and a binary and the binary is there in the drive, it will check and if it's the same, will say 

It finds my router and displays its details. I can feed it my routers details now, using: ifconfig wlan0 key value key value ... They show up in wlan0 when I run ifconfig, but it still doesn't associate. 

What Happened A few days ago I installed FreeBSD 8from USB to my Macbook (Core Duo, 13"). The first thing I wanted to do was get my GUI back. I'm new to FreeBSD and it's my first time off of mac or windows, so I had some learning to do. I tried to a make clean install of xorg with ports but it returned many "No address record" errors. I realised I hadn't configured network settings and then the fun started. I ran ifconfig and it found 5 devices: msk0, ath0, fwe0, fwip0, lo0. * ath0 was identified as media: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Ethernet autoselect so it was clear which one I needed. From what I gathered, there are 3 files and two processes involved here: 

Is there a way to batch generate snapshots every 2-3 minutes or so in Debian. I have a video of approximately 15 minutes and while I could use hotekey 's' to manually generate snapshots . Using vlc 2.2.4 Weathermax. 

at first glance identify --verbose seems to be telling more about the image than exiftool, are there any interesting things that people can point out ? 

I was reading/over-hearing some discussions which said that due to possibility of 'bit rot', hdd's periodically refresh data ? I have seen the hdd indicator giving a steady glow at times which means it's working. If there is way that HDD's periodically refresh data, then it must be using some Operating System oversight ? If yes, are there any tunables that people can use/look into. I am using Debian GNU/Linux. Update - From the comment it seems it ONLY reads data and not write data. If it does not write data, why it does that ? How does merely reading data prevent bit rot or/and hdd corruption ? 

Hi so i was doing some research in the library so i could use some pictures later on my Desktop computer in my room. I have space on my Lab account which i usually SSH into, and i was wondering if URL's can be directly transferred over to a remote machine and saved on the hard disk. I was thinking something like this: 

i7 950 - Stock voltages and clocks 12 Gb 1600 Mhz GSkill RAM GTX 580 1.5 Gb Video Card Corsair HX1000 Watt Powersupply 128 Gb Samsung 830 SSD 2 x 320Gb Samsung F4 in RAID 0 ASUS Xonar STX Audio Card 

So this started all of a sudden. I'm not sure exactly when but a few days ago. Basically i am running Windows 8.1 on a Samsung 850 SSD. Nothings wrong with it, but suddenly after it gets into windows, there's a reallllly slow patch where no applications will open and for a good 1 minute the computer will be in a sort of stasis. The icons on boot up for all my files are white and I have to manually hit refresh for them to load. The sequence is thus: 

I am somewhat confused as putting a large area for /boo encourages reserved and other such directories under Windows 10. I am open to the idea of starting from scratch i.e. install windows 10 again but not sure how to tackle the partitioning so that /boot or /boot/efi so can anybody give me advice as to how to proceed further if I start with a clean slate. 

for ext there is something called ext2ifs $URL$ but unfortunately the development of the tool hasn't been satisfactory ( at least for me) see how it was last released in 2015 and with incomplete ext4 feature-list. I had tried to talk to the developer but he wasn't forthcoming in any details for the future.
