You can often replace the circuit board on a hard drive. Sometimes people buy an identical drive, swap the circuit boards, then recover their data. As others have suggested, separate the drive from any enclosure and any USB circuitry in the enclosure. The board we are discussing is the one that forms the bottom surface of the drive itself. 

The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,..., Z = 25.1 Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as 

A home network only needs a single router. For extending the network, use WiFi repeaters or powerline ethernet (homeplug) An "Internet TV" is a TV that can use wired or wireless networking to access content from your PCs, from other local devices (e.g. NAS) and from Internet services. So far as the LAN is concerned it is just like any PC that needs access to local and Internet services. In a typical home, having multiple routers is a recipe for confusion. 

Footnote: See malgassar's later answer for a link to GitHub source code in Go language that could be used to implement a local test server along the lines I was originally looking for. 

The DSL socket is probably not for Ethernet. Plug the Internet ethernet cable to a WAN port on your router. Plug the computer Ethernet cable to a LAN port on your router. 

They don't They use algorithms known as Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs). These always produce the same sequence of numbers unless you provide a unique "seed" number to start them with. A seed number can be created from a combination of relatively random sources - for example the last few digits of the milliseconds of the current time, the last few motions of the mouse pointer. The result is a sequence of numbers that, for many purposes, is sufficiently like a random sequence to be unpredictable. 

So far as I know, when playing a stereo signal, this gets routed to front left and front right outputs. A mono signal is lekely to be routed to both front-left and front-right. Some sound systems give you limited control over what (if anything) gets routed to the other channels. Some systems can synthesize signals for other channels to give a pseudo surround-sound effect but this isn't a simple duplication of the front signals. I expect the front-center and subwoofer signals may be synthesized by mixing and applying a low-pass-filter. Speaker electrical outputs are a bad source for recording from, normally you want line-out signal levels and impedances. You can buy a DI box for this purpose. Recording speaker output To record what you are listening to, 

Stop this when it reaches the size of the chunk skipped on Computer 1. I did think you could get wget to stop by piping output to a dd statement that breaks the pipe but this turns out to not work 

In general no. In your specific case it might be possible, but you'd have to do significant work. In general I'm confident there's nothing in the PDF spec that mandates the presence of metadata indicating the primary language of the text in the PDF. Even if there was, there are so many different PDF-producing software applications that you can be sure some of them would omit it or set it to a generic value. I'm certain you can produce PDFs from PS files which use an arbitrary text encoding. This means you cannot even guarantee that the encoding can be determined from the PDF content. Therefore you cannot be sure of being able to extract text from which to guess the language. Specific case If your PDFs are all from one source, all produced using the same toolset, and have a limited range of languages, it might be possible to write a program or script to do what you want. However it is unlikely that sufficient numbers of people have this need for there to be an easily found existing solution that would work in your specific case. 

Certainly many server-grade motherboards are designed explicitly for this - the Wikipedia article mentions this, I have HP and IBM servers that include some sort of Ethernet based "console" support for boot messages etc. 

Digital electronics used in computers have two states: on and off. So storage of numbers in memory is made up of collections of elements each of which is on or off. So one element can therefore only represent the numbers 0 and 1 (two values). If you combine two of these you can now represent 2 to the power of two (four) numbers 0…3. 

An IPV4 address is a   32-bit integer number written like 192.168.1.6 An IPV6 address is a 128-bit integer number written like 2607:f750:0:3f::f59 2607:f750:0:3f::f59 is a short notation for a number that can be written in hexadecimal as 

I previously used cwRsync to backup files from WIndows XP to a Linux server Now I am trying to use cwRsync on a Windows 7 PC (64-bit) to backup to a different Linux server I installed the free version of cwRsync and set up the environment as in the included cwrsync.cmd except I set CWRSYNCHOME=%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\CWRSYNC as that's where cwRsync installs on 64-bit Windows. I can ping the Linux server by name and I can resolve it's IP-address using nslookup but when I run rsync I get an error message 

Most new desktop computers will contain a single main CPU chip that has multiple cores. Each core acts much like an independent CPU. Sometimes, each core has a feature called simultaneous multithreading (SMT) which makes each core appear to the operating system as two or more virtual cores. Intel call this HyperThreading. So one CPU chip may contain four cores, each of which has two virtual cores resulting in the operating system seeing eight CPUs. The main conceptual difference between a CPU, core and virtual-core is in the amount of shared resources within the chip. In the past it was common for high powered servers to have several separate CPU chips (and this is probably still true), sometimes on separate CPU boards that plug into a common backplane. Desktop computers will also have one or more GPUs, primarily for graphics. These are much like CPUs and can be used for specialised general computation such as bitcoin mining. Desktop computers will also contain numerous other chips that are not CPUs. These perform specialised functions such as providing USB interfaces and so on. The term chip is used for any integrated circuit (IC) in a package that can be soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB). 

Styles cascade, so this may get overridden by the large chunk of CSS Word embeds in each page. From what I've seen of your page it wont be a problem, if it is - you may need to edit in each file the place where it says and add the there. Having it in a single makes it easier to experiment with styles that affect all chapters at once. If you want to know more about CSS, W3Schools have an excellent tutorial Have you considered using something like markdown and LateX to produce high quality HTML and PDFs from a simpler text source? 

The other possibility is non-standard line-endings for the platform (i.e. CRLF or CR) but I'd expect to cope with that and report "DOS text file" or similar. 

SPI on desktop PC, Modem or router. Your desktop computer, router or modem is unlikely to have an SPI bus that you can access from an ordinary application on your desktop PC. You can get USB-attached General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) devices that might support this. Example 1, Example 2 The obvious solution, if you are new to electronics, is to use an Arduino clone or something similar. SPI SPI is mostly used to communicate between microcontrollers and sensor ICs (e.g., e.g.), other microcontrollers etc. It isn't a natural way to pass data from a Single-Board Computer (SBC) to a Desktop computer, modem or router. Communicating between SBC and above devices. The most obvious methods include 

View the email headers on received email, they show the intermediate points through which the email passed and the date and time of processing at each point. This can prove where the delay occurs. 

It is inappropriate to use iconv on non-text files. What you can do is use a hex-dump program to view the contents of a binary file. 

Generally, it is only server type applications that listen for incoming connections. Windows however also has services that listen for NETBIOS broadcasts and other types of MS network chatter. 

SATA controllers don't support SAS devices. SAS controllers often do support SATA devices. So far as I understand things. So no, you need a separate SAS RAID controller (or use plain SAS controller + software RAID - usually not recommended) See TomsHardware 

They'd be in the best position to provide a general mechanism for all sites but there are complications 

You need a front end web-server acting as a reverse proxy that forwards requests based on the HTTP header. The front end could be a separate server or one of the existing servers. The Apache HTTPD server has a that can be used for this. 

No, the RFCs use (and define) words like "MUST" for this sort of thing. It is possible for this sort of experience to be caused by server-end bugs but I would be very surprised if Superuser had made a negligent error of this sort. Like many websites, Superuser login status is very likely based on session-cookies, not simply on client IP-addresses (that would imply a level of stupidity at Superuser which I strongly believe is simply not credible) 

About Volts and Amps: By analogy with household water pipes Voltage is analogous to pressure, the force pushing water through the pipes. If the taps are turned off the pressure is still there but no water flows. The pipes must be strong enough to resist the pressure, if you use too thin a pipe the pressure will burst it. If a cord is not rated for the voltage used, the insulation may break down and the cord become unsafe or cause a short-circuit and fire. Amps measure electrical current which is the rate of flow of electrical charge. Roughly analogous to litres per second of water flowing in a pipe. Cords have resistance that cause the wires to heat-up at higher currents. Thicker wires have lower resistance and are used for higher current ratings to prevent the wires heating to melting point (more fire probably). So a 5A cord is thicker than a 1.5A cord and can easily carry 1.5A of current.
