On Windows 10 this is very easy to do. Go to Settings > Devices > Pen and turn off Show Visual Effects 

I'm looking for a way to launch 64-bit programs in a Chinese, Japanese, and Russian locale without changing my current system locale (which is English). With Microsoft's AppLocale I was able to launch 32-bit programs in any locale but AppLocale doesn't launch 64-bit programs in a locale different to the system locale. I currently use Windows 8.1 x64 

I know you said you're on Windows 7 but since this was asked 3 years ago and it seems like Win 10 is going to replace Win 8, I thought this would help. 

I'm not sure of what you mean by "when I could be a text box object" but if what you're trying to do is make the text inside the box appear on Ditto, then you have to select the text itself and copy it. If you simply select the box and then copy the box, you would be copying an Adobe Acrobat object and not the text inside it. Most likely, this box object cannot be understood by Ditto so it won't display it. 

When creating system images I can only make exclusions for folders I don't want to backup. However when doing a normal file/folder backup, I can select just a few files/folders within a folder instead of making exclusions for every single file/folder I don't want to backup. That is why I would prefer to do a regular file backup as opposed to a system image. However, is a file backup as effective as a system image at restoring a drive to a previous state from scratch? Would there be any hidden/protected system files/folders that may not be backed up in a file/folder backup? NOTE: When performing the file/folder backup I would be booting up from a recovery drive on a USB flash drive and not from my Windows OS 

Obtaining the Verity utilities The easiest way to get a copy is to download some software which includes them. For example, the PaperPort application bundled with some Dell multifunction printers and old ColdFusion trial versions. Manual installation I'll use the PaperPort 15-day trial as an example. 

Download and run SharpKeys. Click Add, select Function: F13 (00_64) from the list, and map it to Special: PrtSc (E0_37), then click OK. Click Write to Registry, then log off or restart Windows to apply the changes. 

If you were having performance issues before, 2 extra GB will certainly help. When adding extra memory is not an option, get rid of running applications you don't need: some programs feel they are so important they should be always automatically start at system boot. More often then not, you actually want them to run on-demand. Installed vs. usable memory Keep in mind one thing is the physical memory installed and another is the total memory available to the system. If you got an integrated graphic card, for example, part of the memory could be reserved for it. Also, Windows 32-bit client versions are artificially limited to 4 GB (except Windows Vista/7 Starter editions, where the limit is 1 GB and 2 GB respectively) and won't recognize anything past that unless you hack your way round this licensing restriction.

It's not exactly human-friendly, but SharpKeys can be used to handle it with ease. Other features such as the Flip 3D can be selectively disabled by using related registry keys/policies. Anyway, other shortcuts you should take into account: 

I'm trying to figure out a way to boot from a USB flash drive to move files from my internal drive to a USB 3.0 external drive. In the past, I've used "Mini Windows XP" to do this with USB 2.0 external drives, but it doesn't support USB 3.0. What I want to be able to do is move/copy/paste/delete files and create folders on the internal drive and the external drive. Also, I prefer a method that is fast, simple, and that doesn't require the use of the command line, if possible. Context: Right now I'm getting the blue error screen on Windows right after boot so I can't access the log in screen. I want to backup some of my files in my internal storage to an external USB 3.0 drive. 

Since Windows regularly creates system restore points, it overwrites old ones when the allotted space for system restore is full. What I'm trying to do is make a system restore point of my PC's current state and make sure that it won't be overwritten by Windows. I know that I could make a system image but I have ruled that option out because it will also overwrite my personal files (documents, music, etc.). If this is not possible to do, does anyone know of another way to restore my system without affecting personal files? Besides manually copying system folders, that is. 

A quick search returned a forum thread which suggested it's related to HP 3D DriveGuard, a proprietary active hard-drive protection: 

Short answer It doesn't need to, as of now. Long answer Code that targets the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime (CLR) is known as managed code, and code that doesn't is known as unmanaged. 

Open the folder on the SSD, and list all files inside which are named after a Windows edition. If there's more than one, consider the highest edition available. Example: 

If you understand that and want to continue anyway, make sure the destination is NTFS formatted, and that there's sufficient free space. Then follow these steps: 

Workaround You could manually backup all profiles, delete all of them, and finally import everything back. This command will delete all profiles (no matter what the profile names are) by using a wildcard: 

Stripping quotes The quotes might get in the way, but the batch script below can remove them for you. Just save it as (or whatever you like, just keep the extension). The script accepts two parameter: input/output files, respectively. Example usage 

To save bits, the year isn't stored as a whole number; an offset is used instead. Since there are 7 bits, that means possible values, i.e. 1980-2107. As for NTFS, this is what the documentation says: 

Retrieving file names only In case you don't care about the full path, you can use the batch script below. The usage isn't any different from the batch script above. Batch script 

I have a USB flash drive (FAT32 format) with the label "DT100G3" If I assign the drive to the letters "G" or "J" the label shows on Windows Explorer. However, if I assign the letter "F" to it, the label in Windows Explorer shows the default "Removable Disk" label. I've tried adding an autorun.inf file to the USB flash drive containing this text: 

I want to merge 2 non-adjacent partitions. Since partitions need to be adjacent to be merged with disk partitioning tools, I plan to create a copy of the partition that is in between the ones I want to merge and then delete it. From left to right, the lineup is regular storage partition, System Partition (created during Windows 10 installation), and Boot Partition (contains the Windows 10 OS). If I copy the System Partition into unallocated space to the left of the regular storage partition, can I safely delete the original System Partition? Meaning that it shouldn't cause any kind of system errors? Note: To make the copy of the system partition, I will be using EaseUS Partition Master. This is what I have: 

However, the label still shows up as "Removable Disk" in Windows Explorer. If I open Windows's Computer Management and go to Storage > Disk Management I can see that the label is still "DT100G3" even though it doesn't show in Explorer. What I have noticed is that in Disk Management, there is no drive letter next to my flash drive's label. The other drives do have a letter next to their label (e.g. My C drive has a "(C:)" next to its label). I think the issue may be related to the fact that the letter "F" is the default letter assigned to any removable disk that I plug into my PC. Perhaps there is an entry in the Windows Registry that makes all drives that get assigned to "F" have the label "Removable Disk"? Edit: I reformatted the flash drive to NTFS, changed the drive letter to "G", then reformatted back to FAT32. Now even when using the letter "G" the label says "Removable Disk" in Explorer. 

Open a command prompt as administrator. Type or paste the following command, and press Enter to run it: 

Depending on the collection, some of the folders listed above might be empty or missing entirely. The and the folders are the most relevant ones. Partitions 

Start . Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Error Reporting. Double-click the Prevent display of the user interface for critical errors policy, and set it to Enabled. 

Samples Same as test A1. Results The cache reached a total size of about 31.74 MiB. Compared to test A1, a tighter limit generated definitely less cached entries, and more discarded ones. 

By default, the output is quite verbose and includes different information, such as file size or last modified time. To get a bare bones list stripping all extra information, use the parameter: 

Formatting through the command line When formatting via the graphical interface, Windows will try to detect and list only the file systems which are best suited for the selected disk or partition. By using a command prompt you can override the default behavior, and use just any file system. 

Note SRWare Iron is supposed to provide an tweaking feature through an file placed in the program folder. It didn't work properly when I tested it, though. Further reading 

Full encryption If you need true disk encryption, you should probably look into BitLocker (only available on the Ultimate and Enterprise editions), or a third-party solution like TrueCrypt. TrueCrypt - update The official TrueCrypt website now reads:
