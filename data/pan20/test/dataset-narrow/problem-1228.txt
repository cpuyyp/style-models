This is sometimes known as the Social Golfer problem (see also the Wolfram MathWorld page and this page from CSPlib). Probably the most famous instance of this problem is Kirkman's Schoolgirl problem. 

Allow me to try to redeem my previous incorrect answer with an attempt at showing that this problem is NP-complete via a reduction from GRAPH 3-COLORABILITY. The key idea is to identify SEQ as a list of edges of some graph and observe that a "relaxed node assignment" corresponds to a graph homomorphism. Let $H = (U, E)$ be a connected, undirected graph with $U = \{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$. Let $P = (u_{a_1}, u_{a_2}, \ldots, u_{a_p})$ be a (non-simple) path in $H$ that traverses every edge at least once (i.e.: if there is an edge between $u_i$ and $u_j$, then they appear consecutively in $P$ in either order). First, we need to show that $P$ is not too long. We can construct $P$ as follows: 

Not sure if this fits your criteria, but there is the dot-depth hierarchy of star-free regular languages. 

EDIT As noted in comments below, I originally read the question incorrectly. I thought the goal was to determine if removing $k$ edges could increase the MST weight of $G$ above some given threshold $t$. This problem is often known as "$k$ Most Vital Edges (for MST)", simply $k$-MVE (or sometimes $k$-MVE-MST to distinguish from other variations), as cited in my original answer. However, the asker poses instead the question of whether or not removing $k$ edges could increase the MST weight of $G$ by any amount. Let's call this problem "$k$ Any Vital Edges" or $k$-AVE. We will show that $k$-AVE is in P. Let $G=(V,E)$ be an edge-weighted graph with weight function $w:E\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. The goal of $k$-AVE is to find a subset of edges $S \subseteq E$ of size $k$ such that the MST weight of $G$ is strictly less than the MST weight of $G\setminus S \triangleq (V, E\setminus S)$. We'll call such an $S$ a valid $k$-AVE set. We will proceed by outlining necessary and sufficient conditions for $S$ to be a valid $k$-AVE set. Let $T$ be a MST of $G$. For every edge $e \in T$, we may associate a partition of $V$ into two parts (i.e.: a cut) based on how $e$ splits $T$ (i.e.: each partition consists of the vertices reachable from either endpoint of $e$ using only edges in $T \setminus \{e\}$). In particular, we will denote by $C_e$ the cut-set of this associated partition (i.e.: set of edges in $G$ that straddle this partition, including $e$ itself). Now, by the Cut Property of MSTs, we know that each $e$ has minimum weight among all edges in $C_e$; there may be more than one edge in $C_e$ with that same minimum weight. Let these sets be denoted $M_e \triangleq \{e' \in C_e | w(e') = w(e)\}$. Suppose that, for some $e$, $M_e\subseteq S$. Then, we conclude that $G\setminus S$ has larger MST weight than $G$. Otherwise, we would have some MST $T'$ in $G$ that did not use any of the minimum weight edges across the cut-set $C_e$, a contradiction of the Cut Property. This shows that a sufficient condition for $S$ to be a valid $k$-AVE set is for it to contain $M_e$ for some $e$. Next, we will show that this is condition is also necessary. Suppose to the contrary that, for all $e\in T$, $S$ excludes some $e' \in M_e$ (of course allowing that $e'$ may equal $e$). In general, removing $S$ from $G$ splits $T$ into a forest. We will reconstruct a new minimum spanning tree $T'$ from $T\setminus S$ by using the edges spared by $S$, as follows: 

In [1], the author presents an acceptance/rejection algorithm for generating a uniform sample from the set of perfect matchings of a bipartite graph. While the samples are exactly uniform regardless of the structure of the graph, the run-time is only guaranteed to be polynomial if the graph has a particular structure -- essentially, if the degree of each node is $\gamma n \pm O(log (n))$ for some constant $\gamma$. 

According to this abstract, deciding whether a 4-regular planar graph has a Hamiltonian Path is NP-complete. Edited to add: Call a path that is allowed to revisit nodes a walk. Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and let us impose a weight of 1 on each edge. Then, $G$ has a Hamiltonian path if and only if the minimum weight walk in G visiting each vertex has weight $n-1$. In other words, if you can compute the minimum weight of a Hamiltonian walk, you can can detect the existence of Hamiltonian paths.

It should be clear that $f$ is a valid relaxed node assignment. It should be equally clear that we can reverse this construction to use any valid relaxed node assignment to define a 3-coloring of $H$. 

Take $S_i$ to be the edges of a graph $G$. Then, a partition $F$ of size $k$ corresponds to an edge-coloring of $G$; the minimum such $k$ corresponds to the chromatic index of $G$. Edge-coloring is known to be NP-complete: "The NP-Completeness of Edge-Colouring". 

As I understand it, the National Resident Matching Program was for a long time just a straight application of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem. It has since been slightly updated to handle some extra details like spousal assignments (aka the "two-body problem"), etc... 

According to this abstract for "The Complexity of Counting Cuts and of Computing the Probability that a Graph is Connected" (SIAM J. Comput. 12 (1983), pp. 777-788), counting anti-chains in a partial order is #P-complete. I don't have access to this paper so I can't tell if this result covers maximal anti-chains or not. 

According to this reference (1), the lexicographically first topological order problem is NLOG-complete. You may want to take a more thorough look at the article to ensure that it covers the case(s) that you're interested in. In particular, based on the technical report version (pdf) of that article, it appears that they're treating the lexicographic ordering of the vertices as strict (e.g.: in your notation, $\lambda(u) \neq \lambda(v) $ for $u \neq v$), but I'm not sure if this affects the applicability of the result. 

Reference 17 in that paper is the aforementioned Poljak et al. (1981). $L_3$ is the class of 3-uniform hypergraphs and $L^l_3$ is the class of linear 3-uniform hypergraphs. 

By visiting each vertex's neighbors, each edge in $H$ is traversed. Each neighbor visitation step adds $O(n)$ steps to the path. Each travel to a successive vertex adds another $O(n)$ steps. So, in total length of $P = (u_{a_1}, u_{a_2}, \ldots, u_{a_p})$ is $O(n^2)$. Let $SEQ = (x_0, x_{a_1}, x_{a_2}, x_{a_3},\ldots,x_{a_p}, x_{n+1})$ be the sequence of variables. Let $G = (V, A)$ be the complete, directed graph on three vertices adjoined with a universal source and a universal sink. Explicitly, let $V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_{source}, v_{sink}\}$. There is an arc from $v_{source}$ to $v_i$ and from $v_i$ to $v_{sink}$ for $i=1,2,3$. And, for all $i,j = 1,2,3, i \neq j$ there is an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. Finally, we claim that a valid relaxed node assignment from $SEQ$ to $G$ exists iff $H$ is 3-colorable. Let $c:U \rightarrow \{1,2,3\}$ be a 3-coloring of $H$. Let $f:X \rightarrow V$ be defined by: 

EDIT: mjqxxxx points out in comments below that this construction can be slightly modified to obtain a poly-time algorithm for HAMILTONIAN-PATH. Thus, I think it's safe to say that this answer is incorrect as it stands. It looks like the error is in stating that $L_1 \cap L_2$ and $L_1 \cup L_2$ can be represented succinctly. 

In other words, you cannot guarantee that the minimal cover is sub-exponential in the size of the input. EDIT: However, the asker is asking whether or not an output-polynomial algorithm exists (i.e.: an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the size of the input and output). The nearest reference I can find is in the paper "Identifying the Minimal Transversals of a Hypergraph and Related Problems", SIAM J. Computing, 1995 (24) by Eiter and Gottlob. They first define problems AP1 and AP2 where AP2 is the dependency inference problem. Then, they state the following: 

Here's a special case: the number of binary words of length $k$ such that no two ones appear consecutively is $F(k+3)$, where $F(n)$ is the $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number (starting with $F(1)=1, F(2)=1$). Proof is via the Zeckendorf representation. EDIT: We can extend this initial special case into the slightly larger special case of $a\lozenge^0a$. Consider strings of length $k$ over an alphabet of size $l+1$ such that the letter $a$ does not appear twice consecutively. Let $f(k)$ be the number of such strings (which we will call "valid"). We claim that: $$f(k) = l*f(k-1) + l*f(k-2)$$ $$ f(0) = 1, f(1) = l+1$$ The intuition is that we can construct a valid string of length $k$ by either: a) adjoining any of the $l$ letters that are not $a$ to a valid string of length $k-1$, or b) adjoining the letter $a$ and then any other letter but $a$ to a valid string of length $k-2$. You can verify that the following is a closed form for the above recurrence: $$f(k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} {{k+1-i}\choose{i}} l^{k-i}$$ where we understand ${{n}\choose{i}} = 0$ when $i>n$. EDIT #2: Let's knock out one more case -- a $\lozenge^0 b, a \neq b$. We'll call strings over an $l$-element alphabet that do not contain the substring $ab$, "valid" and let $S_k$ denote the set of valid strings of length $k$. Further, let's define $T_k$ to be the subset of $S_k$ consisting of strings starting with $b$ and $U_k$ to be those not starting with $b$. Finally, let $f(k) = |S_k|$, $g(k) = |T_k|$, $h(k) = |U_k|$. We observe that $g(0)=0, h(0)=1, f(0)=1$ and $g(1)=1, h(1)=l-1, f(1)=l$. Next, we infer the following recurrences: \begin{eqnarray} g(k+1) &=& f(k) \\ h(k+1) &=&(l-1)*h(k) + (l-2)*g(k) \end{eqnarray} The first comes from the fact that adding a $b$ to the start of any element of $S_k$ produces an element of $T_{k+1}$. The second comes from observing that we can construct an element of $U_{k+1}$ by adding any character but $b$ to the front of any element of $U_{k}$ or by adding any character but $a$ or $b$ to the front of any element in $T_k$. Next, we rearrange the recurrence equations to obtain: \begin{eqnarray} f(k+1) &=& g(k+1) + h(k+1) \\ &=& f(k) + (l-1)*h(k) + (l-2)*g(k) \\ &=& f(k) + (l-1)*f(k) - g(k) \\ &=& l*f(k) - f(k-1) \end{eqnarray} We can get a rather opaque closed-form solution to this recurrence by mucking around a bit with generating function stuff or, if we're lazy, heading straight to Wolfram Alpha. However, with a little bit of googling and poking around in OEIS, we find that we actually have: $$f(k) = U_k(l/2)$$ where $U_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind (!). 

Unfortunately, it seems that this problem is intractably super-polynomial. According to the same extended abstract: 

This appears to be known as the "set reconciliation" problem. The key paper appears to be Minsky & Trachtenberg, "Set Reconciliation With Nearly Optimal Communication Complexity", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (2003). Also, here is some subsequent work on this problem by the same authors: "Practical Set Reconciliation". 

I don't have access to the Poljak et al. paper, but the abstract here seems to indicate that recognizing line-graphs of $r$-hypergraphs is NP-complete for $r \geq 3$, not $4$. Also, the citation in Edge intersection graphs of linear 3-uniform hypergraphs, Skums et al. (pdf) seems to indicate that this is the case: 

I don't have access to this article right now but I would wager that the "topology" in "topological sort" does not come from the mathematical notion of topology (e.g.: open sets, compactness, etc...) but rather from the "network topology" sense.
