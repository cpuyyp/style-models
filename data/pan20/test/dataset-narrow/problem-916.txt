After this I can't do because it can't find . Is there another way to install this on slackware 12.2 or is there any package of it or this program is meant only for Debian/Ubuntu like distros? 

And you should be able to open web sites. Unfortunately, you won't be able to use this for connections. If you want to have full internet access, then you'll need to configure . 

After reading the comments in @Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams's answer I believe installing a would be a better solution. For example, if your machine is and it has lan access to (the computer with internet) 

Does anybody have an idea what may be the problem ? Relevant info: @Server OS: Slackware 12.2 @Apache Version: 2.2.10 @Apache User / Group: daemon / daemon @PHP Version: 5.3.6 (Latest) @PHP ini file: /usr/local/php-5.3.6/lib/php.ini @PHP ini file perms: 777 (daemon.daemon) 

It appears that when you have password that contains slashes (\ /) you need to escape them in the pg_connect connection url. After escaping that I had no problems connecting to the database via php. Hope this helps somebody having this problem :) 

I'm currently migrating from Apache to nginx. I have a couple of domains that are going to be hosted on the same machine with one IP address. Though I've configured it seems that doesn't include my vhost configuration files. My current nginx.conf looks like this: 

Actually, the command above is perfectly correct. Unfortunately at the time I asked the question the routing table was a bit broken. So the actual route was going though the wrong IP address even with the argument. 

I decided to upgrade a machine running 13.2 to the latest Leap 42.1. I started the process and it did the upgrade. After the reboot everything is working except for the redis server service. I can't start the redis service using: 

I tried to add this line to the configuration but apparently is an unknown header name... Apparently I'm missing something? 

You will need to edit file Find line listen and comment it. Uncomment line Enable the apache module with Enable the apache module with Add this to your virtual host 

I've configured a server running apache and a couple of days ago I noticed in the logs that there are bots running endless queries to the site. The logs show that those bots are running about 60 queries per second for about 20 minutes coming from the same IP address. How can I limit the queries and what's the appropriate way of dealing with such bots? Thanks in advance. 

I would say APC on Shared Hosting plans is generally not a good idea. The answer of your hosting is right but that's not the only reason. When you get a Shared hosting you should be aware that you're not the only one who's using the server where your site is hosted. Depending on the hosting company's server, there may be 300 (or more) clients who're also hosting their sites on that machine. Often those sites have MANY php files. For example a joomla 1.6 driven site has ~3000 php (~10mb) files (includes the site and admin panel). Imagine all of those 300 clients are using the Joomla platform and the sites are 

Actually I found it myself. You have to rewrite the links yourself via HttpSubModule. Be sure to set so that it replaces all the links on the page, not just the first one it finds. 

Bottom line is no system administrator will go through all the pain in the *ss to enable and support APC. This is also not a benefit for the company. They would rather have 300 more clients paying them money than dealing with APC and wondering if their server won't go down or something won't go wrong any moment. A better solution would be if the client gets a (managed) dedicated server. That way the client will be the only one hosting a site on that server and he could ask the support to install whatever hi wants on the server. This will be a lot more easier and will save the clietn, the sys admin and the hosting company from growing white hair :) I hope this helps you understand a bit better why APC is not included in shared hostings. 

I have configured a proxy server. Everything works great except for the header. I can't manage to figure out how to pass that header to the site I'm attempting to open via the proxy. This is my current configuration: 

I have this strange and stupid problem I'm trying to resolve for a couple of hours now. I have installed apache 2.2.10 (it was compiled from source a long time ago), and PHP-5.3.6. Both are working just great except for the fact I can't get PHP to load the php.ini file. This is my config.nice file: 

At my company we're currently developing a product which will eventually support authentication via OpenLDAP and Active Directory. We have configured a Windows Server 2016 and would like to create an isolated environment via windows containers to test our app in. Unfortunately I am hitting a wall when it comes to installing/enabling the AD feature in the container. The error I'm receiving is: 

Edit 1: I remembered there is a module for apache that could limit those things - mod_evasive. Personally I have never used it but many people refer to it as "good stuff". I found a tutorial for you that might help you - $URL$ Check it out and see if that could suite your needs. 

Based on a forum post with the exact same problem I found from 2014, it apperas you shouldn't be running both Docker and VirtualBox at the same time. The exact quote is: 

I guess it's not matching against the proper variable at . Is this the right way to be done or I'm missing something? 

Any ideas what has changed from 13.2 to 42.1 and why has the service stopped working? Also I don't seem to recall how I previously had the redis listed in - after the upgrade it's gone from there, although I'm not quite sure that's part of the problem. Edit: Here is the log file thanks to @Michael Hampton: 

If you have a physical access to the server you may try doing this with GParted. It's a free and OpenSource project that can re-partition Ext2/3/4, NTFS and many other file system formats. What you should be aware is that you should be really careful when you're using the program. If your computer get's turned off (loss of electricity?) - you will probably get all of the information on the drive messed up. So you'll need to reinstall a fresh copy and start from zero. 

Post can be found here. P.S. Please feel free to post an answer/comment should the situation change in the future. 

I'm having a problem with apache + php 5.3.5 installed on Debian 6. Apache will not honor the permissions of my files. Apache is running under user & group "daemon" and the files are owned by user & group "myUser". For example if myfile.php is with permissions 700 apache will execute it although it shouldn't be doing it. The same configuration works fine under Slackware 13.1. Does anybody know what am I doing wrong? 

That means all of those clients will have ~900000 files to be eventually cached - ~3000mb RAM will be used only for caching the php files. As you know in APC you can also store "User cache entries" where you can usually store settings or serialized objects. I can't say how much RAM will go there because it depends on what you store, but let's say another extra 50-100mb. For now we've used about 3,1GB RAM. Now add some RAM needed by the basic services to run - Apache, FTP, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SendMail and server backup tools. You'll probably end up somewhere near 5-6GB RAM that will be almost permanently in use. The other problems with APC come when you cache - everybody can see what you've cached (as far as I know). So you'll probably need to encrypt what you store - this will require more CPU because you'll be encrypting/decrypting all the time. Also if somebody accidentally clears the all of the cached files/user entries the server will go mad trying to re-cache. 

I've recently experimented with the settings in pg_hba.conf. I read the PostgreSQL documentation and I though that the "password" auth method is what I want. There are many people that have access to the server PostgreSQL is working on so I don't want the "trust" method. So I changed it. But then PHP stopped working with the database. The message I get is "Warning: pg_connect(): Unable to connect to PostgreSQL server: FATAL: password authentication failed for user "myuser" in /my/path/to/connection/class.php on line 35". It is kind of strange because I can connect via phppgadmin without any problems and also I can connect from my home computer with psql - again without any problems. This is my pg_hba.conf: 

Unfortunately this is not going though the interface I want it to. At the moment I have and , and I would like to monitor only . Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? 

This may be a really dumb question but how can you open a port on multiple interfaces without defining the interfaces? For example how do I open port 22 on all interfaces? On my machine I have some interfaces that are dynamic and may or may not be available so I have to set "generic" rules. This code is not working for me but I can't figure out why: 

I'm trying to figure out how to configure a reverse proxy in nginx when the endpoint is in a root context: proxy forwards to Unfortunately I can't change the context of the application at , so I'm trying to figure out a workaround in nginx for this issue. The following configuration usually works fine when there is a context, but doesn't work in the situation above: 

I've used this config.nice for all the PHP versions since 5.2 with slight changes and it is working this way on a couple of servers. It's probably something small I'm missing and I can't figure what it is. I set the '--with-config-file-path' because I though php can't find it's own path or something. In the defined path I have a file called php.ini which is copied from the PHP 5.3.6 tarball (php.ini-development). The file should be working as it's the original but I can't see because it's not loading - phpinfo() returns: 

Imagine you have a couple of records in the table that contain the words "test","testing","tester" in all of the columns. Now you'd want to select all the records that contain the word "test" in all of the columns. The appropriate sql query would be: 

I've created a slackware build script so I could build a specific package and then install it on a couple of servers running identical versions. I'm aware you could use to do things after the package was installed, but is there a similar script that's executed upon uninstall? For example, when the package is installed, in I have a couple of specific environment variables that append to . I'm wondering if it is possible to automatically remove them from if the package gets deleted (i.e. create a that would do that)? 

So, I have two interfaces from different ISP's and I'm trying to monitor my connection using . This is the command I'm currently trying to use: 

will redirect everything from recursively. That means will be redirected to thus you end up in an endless cycle. The solution is to use rewrite in file, saved at . Something like this code should do the work: 

This is easy to be done. Go to /my/path/to/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php. Open it up with your favorite editor and: 

I'm currently trying to get nginx to work with cgit which uses cgi. I know nginx doesn't support cgi directly but it appears you can support it indirectly via FastCGIWrap. The link above is pretty self explanatory but I'm having a problem with compiling the program. What I've done so far: 

What I am trying to achieve with this is to require a group based on the first regex variable. So if the user goes to he has to be in the group to be able to open the url. For some reason I can't get this code working and apache returns: 

This is something I think you set up while installing MacOS. If you have chosen non-case-sensitive - you'll have to back up your data... and reformat/reinstall. This is what I found googling for your problem: $URL$ Hope this helps :) 

Everything now should be working fine and should ask for a user and password. Additionally you could add an HTTP Auth as @Cocowalla said - for even more security. Hope this helps :) 

I'm new to James Mail Server and I would appreciate it if some of you could help me on my task.. I'm required to build a newsletter system that could send mass mail (>=100,000 subscribers) to members of a site without being marked as spam. The problem is the actual sending. The site is developed under php & postgresql but still I think that selecting >100,000 emails from the database and sending them at once is a bit extreme... :) How can I send them in small parts so all of the emails get sent within a day or two? What's the right approach to this problem? Will a server with 8 cores and 4gb ram + about 30,000 unique users every day be able to handle the traffic of the live site and sending mails at the same time ? What should I monitor mostly to prevent eventual problems ? I would really appreciate any help or directions! I have never written a newsletter for such a big number of subscribers.... P.S. The good old free software solutions available out there will not work for me as I'm required to create a customized newsletter which has to be integrated in the site's admin control panel... Thanks in advance! 

OpenSUSE 42.2, with latest updates Kernel 4.10.1-2.g561cf31-default (from kernel.opensuse.org) Docker version 1.12.6, build 78d1802 VirtualBox 5.1.14r112924 The machine has 12 cores & 32GB ram and has hyper threading enabled. (after all services have been started there is ~19GB free RAM left) 

After searching for a while I found out that need to comment out the or set it to . The funny part is I had the same configuration on 13.2 and it worked without any problems. Anyway hope this helps anybody. 

I also tried to set the absolute path to the config file but it didn't work either. All of the request are landing on the default server. If, though, you insert the content of into the domain works just fine. I've been trying to figure this out for a couple of hours now but I guess I'm doing something wrong? 

I've been wondering if there is a way to get apache statistics? I'm looking for something that can show graphs and inform me what's the traffic at certain hours, how is the server performing during those hours and etc. I tried the default Apache Server Status but it didn't fit my needs. 

I don't know what OS you're using on your server but I would guess it's a UNIX (Debian,Ubuntu,Slackware etc) distro. The easy way to protect yourself from DoS is by installing Fail2Ban ($URL$ It's easy to install and use. I'm using it for SSH protection because I get loads of ssh dos attacks. The program scans log files and checks for repeating messages (i.e. failed login, many connections like in your situation). You'll have to tune it a bit to read properly the log file of your web server. If you manage to do that you can limit the access - i.e. you can limit 50 attempts for GET requests in 1 second by 1 ip. When the threshold is reached the IP address is banned for X time. This will help you save your bandwith and not to worry if this attack will come from another address. Hope this helps you :) 

I've been trying to figure out how to reverse-proxy requests and preserve the original host. For example let's say I have as my front-end and I want to reverse-proxy the requests to . How to preserve the original url so that would become on the front-end ? P.S. I tried using but this preserves only the original host.
