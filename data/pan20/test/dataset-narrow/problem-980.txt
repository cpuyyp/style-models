I have a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro running Arch Linux with GNOME. Normally, I listen to music using the analog audio I/O interface -- the 3.5mm socket. Recently, I had to attach a USB microphone to the laptop. While doing that, I used the microphone's built-in 3.5mm socket to monitor the sound I was recording with lower latency and less distortion than what the laptop's internal amplifier, and the backing software, would produce. Because of this, I went into GNOME's sound options and updated the audio output profile to digial, which allowed me to pipe system sounds through the mic and into my headphones while I was monitoring the audio received by the microphone. After switching back to using the 3.5mm socket on my laptop and reverting the audio output profile to analog (the only option available without the mic), the outputted audio's really distorted. After some tinkering using the ALSA mixer and reproduction of the issue on the laptop's main speakers, I've concluded that the issue is that outputting audio to my headphones now results in the bass part of the spectrum being cut off completely, resulting in a tinny, distorted, and almost downsampled effect. Unfortunately, I haven't found any settings allowing me to tweak the bass response for the 3.5mm out. Where can I do this system-wide? 

I'm running Firefox on Arch Linux, and my support for international fonts is very limited. This results in a lot of tofu on web pages: 

Seems to not find either linux partition (mint on sda6 or debian on sda8), though the debian bootloader boots either just fine. Running a "deeper search"... I don't understand why doesn't seem to complain, yet does. I should also add some more info I found others had requested from similar problems (my OSX is 10.11.6 on a MacBook Pro 11,3): 

I'd still like to learn a little by fixing this quad-boot. First of all, how do I find out what is wrong? I know the symptoms but gdisk has no complaints... Where do I start? I can only access Linux Mint & Debian (sda6 & sda8) from bootloader (on sda, installed from Debian). Windows (says it's on sda1, but its installed on sda4) just sits and does nothing. If I type exit at grub command line I can go straight to OSX. If I hold down Option key I get OSX, OSX Recovery and Windows, of which only first 2 work. This seems to have started when I had to reinstall my Franken-Debian (well not too bad, just thought it would be easier than fixing it - 2 branches in sources.list is all) (sda8) and now I wonder if I installed it not in UEFI mode... Is this possible? If I select Windows it just sits forever. Here is my partitions; 

The instructions I followed are on my windows partition so I can't say exactly (yet at least) how I did it, but I remember starting with OSX, partitioning everything up ahead, then installing BootCamp/Windows. After that I installed Mint and then finally Debian. Debian has always been my default (master) boot loader and I would like to return to that. I don't want to use rEFIt/rEFInd or Clover or anything else. Journaling and csrutil are disabled for what it is worth... If I mount /dev/disk0s1 under /Volumes/EFI, I see that it looks the same, 

I'd actually figured this out a little while back by installing Google's Noto fonts. I'm not at my Arch box right now, but under Fedora these are available in the repos as for the lot of them. 

In Chrome, when typing a search into the Omnibar, I can user Cmd+Enter to open the webpage or search query in a new tab, with the tab immediately being backgrounded -- this way, my focus stays on the current page rater than switching tabs. In Firefox, I can use the similar key combination Alt+Enter to open a search or URL in a new tab, but the new tab is immediately focused. Is there a key combination in Firefox that lets me mimic the backgrounding behaviour present in Chrome? Additionally, is there any way I can bind this to Cmd+Enter? My operating system is OS X. 

The script runs fine when it's launched manually, using a shell, but produces only these entries in Console.app: 

I'm trying to automate a very periodic git add/commit/push cycle using a shell script and cron under OS X 10.8.5. The script is as basic as one would expect it to be: 

I'm interested in abandoning OS X in favour of ElementaryOS, a Linux distribution. Before I do that, I want to know about any "gotchas" which would make installing Linux on a Retina MacBook Pro different from installing it on other hardware. The two possible hangup points in my mind are: 

It was waiting for me to enter something for "Root:". I'm guessing this means the NFS share root, so I entered it (), although it should've already been picked up from my initial command. That's when I got this error: 

Also remember the difference between SI decimal prefixes and IEC binary prefixes: 1 kilobyte (KB) = 10^3 = 1000 bytes for SI, 1 kibibyte (KiB) = 2^10 = 1024 bytes. Although they shouldn't, most hard drive manufacturers mix this up in their favor. 

But it's not showing up when I run as root (ignore the errors; they're from all the GUID Partition Tables I have on my other drives): 

I'm trying to mount a flash drive (16 GB Cruzer) on my Arch Linux desktop. It works fine on my Arch Linux laptop, so it's not a problem with the drive. The drive is in : 

The server already successfully exports NFS shares to other Linux machines, so I'm pretty sure it has no problems. I added an entry in for the new Windows machine and restarted the service. On the Windows machine, I enabled the following in "Add/Remove Programs": 

I'm trying to enable Firefox's "Browse by Name" feature, which lets you type a random string into the location bar and automatically have it searched using the search provider of your choice. This is what I did: 

It's also worked in my Windows 8 VM, running in VirtualBox, just fine until recently. Now, the remapping no longer applies to the Windows host - I think it started with the release of VirtualBox 4.3.16. When I try to use the regular Left Ctrl, it triggers Caps Lock in the Linux host. 

Part of the Korean Wikipedia home page as an example -- although most interational fonts show up the same way. Conversely, international fonts in the window's title bar do show up properly: 

I did set up the crontab using root, and I have no idea whatsoever what that plist has to do with the script I'm trying to do. What's wrong with my setup? 

I'm trying to get my Arch Linux installation to recognize a Kobo Aura H2O e-reader. I've connected it via USB, which starts charging the reader. Usually within a second or two, the reader itself asks whether to connect to the computer, which I allow it to do. After this, the reader doesn't show up as a mounted or unmounted drive, though. I've tried to look at the output of , but it doesn't show up there, either. Finally, I can't find it under . My OS is installed on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. How can I get my computer to recognize this e-reader? 

I usually set the DNS servers on my laptop to be and , which are Google's DNS servers, via the System Preferences > Network > $Interface > DNS pane. Far too often though, these servers reset to the ones broadcasted by my home gateway -- not just on reboot or when bringing an interface down and back up, sometimes seemingly at random. I can see these changes, again, in the System Preferences > Network > $Interface > DNS pane. Is there a way to make my DNS settings persistent? 

I usually delete my questions when I find an answer, if no one has responded. Also, there are many keyboard type questions online, but I did not find anything specific to (not saying these are unique); 

where astralinuxce is Debian. I have never had luck with BCDedit and I do have this $URL$ on usb, but I would like some guidance before I do anything. I understand linux boot fairly well, but not really windows or OSX... I can repost on pastebin or something the output of the linked software. Booting into OSX, says no problem. I'll note that this is 1.0.3 while the one from Linux Mint install was 1.0.1... But, I do note that and don't agree, though I think that may be normal?? 

I'm used to using 'ls' as I would in Linux Mint, e.g. 'ls *.pdf', but in this Debian variant 'ls .pdf' complains. I find myself using a length 'find -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".pdf" -print' instead. Reading this: ls working strangely did not help too much. I do have bash_completions package and I have no weird aliases for 'ls' in my '~/.bashrc' file - I never edit the '/etc/profile' or the global one, wherever it is. Just guessing, I did apply the solution in the linked question but it didn't work. I don't fully understand 'complete' - I guess it is part of 'readline' - so maybe a short explanation would help too (It has no 'man' page). This works though: 'complete -p ls *.pdf', which 'complete --help' says, 

I'm trying to install Arch on a flash drive. To do so, I'm trying to first get a bootable, "live" version of Arch on the flash drive I'm going to install it on later. I've followed the instructions here to the letter, but for some reason, the Mac's bootloader doesn't recognize the flash drive at all, and it's not showing up on my desktop as an external storage device. It does, however, show up in Disk Utility, and when I run diskutil list in the terminal. Attempts to mountDisk are failing repeatedly, both from the terminal and GUI disk utilities. To clarify: I'm able to mount the disk (as in, , but not the logical volume, i.e. , which contains Archboot). This, in turn, prevents the bootloader from detecting the flash drive as a bootable volume. I have already asked this question on Ask Different, but it doesn't seem likely that I'll get much help with it there. Has anyone else here had this issue? How did you fix it? 

I've just swapped out a 4GB GeForce 960 for an 8GB GeForce 1070, and I'm noticing some inconsistent behaviour between Windows's screen and Nvidia's control panel. While the Nvidia control panel correctly recognizes it as having 8192MB of available VRAM (under ), Windows stubbornly insists that only ~1MB is available (1,048,576 bytes). Whenever I launch a task that hits the VRAM a lot -- for example, rendering scenes with high-resolution textures -- it becomes really clear that I've got far less than 8GB available, and even less than my original 4GB, since texture loading gets aborted long before it's complete, usually after only a tiny part of the textures are loaded. I'm not sure that this reflects one megabyte of VRAM being available, but it still renders many games unplayable. I've updated the video drivers through Windows, and am running version 385.69. What could cause this kind of discrepancy, and how can I get my system to correctly recognize the amount of VRAM this card has available? I'm on Windows 10.0.15063.
