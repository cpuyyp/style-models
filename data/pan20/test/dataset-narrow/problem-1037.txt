Now, if you enter "Jan 2015" or "January 2015", LO Calc will expand it to "January 2015" and handle it internally as "01/01/2015". If you enter "Feb 2015" in the next cell and drag both cells down, Calc will increment the month: 

EDIT: To adapt the position so tabs don't indent the numbering, you'll have to set the appropriate values in the numbering style's position settings. Using the following setting (notice the selection 1-10 in the left list box), there's no difference between the different levels: 

You can solve this using two small macros (to determine the name of the last sheet) in combination with the range operator and the function. First, create the following macro ( -> -> , create a new module or use the default module; paste the following code): 

The option in the security settings affects only the Writer component. I think it would be useful to have this option for Calc and Impress documents, too. EDIT: Here's my request for enhancement (libreoffice bugzilla entry) regarding this issue. 

AFAIK, you can't do this inside LO Calc. But you can "postprocess" the chart, e.g. with Inkscape, after exporting the chart as SVG. There, you can split the data lines in single pieces and format them manually. 

In the column of hyperlink targets at the left, make sure that is selected; also, make sure that the text field is empty so the hyperlink points to the current document; Set the hyperlink target: either enter the Bookmark name preceded by a , or hit the button to select the bookmark from a tree view: 

and put the values and into cells E1 and E2, respectively. Now, if you change E1 and/or E2, every formula will use that values. If there are certain combinations of those two values you need to apply often, you may define scenarios accordingly 

Take care that this won't clear the history / MRU, it will just affect how much entries will be visible. If you increase the value after setting it to 0, the "old" history entries will appear again. Use the History Master extension Check the OpenOffice.org Extension "History Master". It works for me like a charm in LibreOffice 4.2.0.4 and will allow to do some other nice things besides managing the PickList/MRU length. 

LO Calc will display the chart object that's currently selected by showing little green squares. After selecting the X axis, this should look similar to this: 

using the paragraph style's border and background settings, you can modify table cells, too. If it doesn't work for you: 

You could use some sort of "lookup table" to translate the month names to dates (this solution is based on a solution proposed for the opposite operation - translate numbers to month names) Just put the month names one after each other into a column on your spreadsheet, and define a named range on those cells (e.g. ). Now, you can determine the month's number using which results in : 

In the new Sheet Style properties, assign a name (for example, ""), and on the "" tab, set the Orientation to ""; 

If i understand correctly, you need to set the margin between the page border and the top of the Header to a certain value. You can achieve this easily in LibreOffice Writer, so you don't need to manipulate the document in MS Word. There are different spacing values you can set: 

Use any of the other connector start/endpoints of the object as endpoint. Assuming the starting element is a rectangle, it has four start/end points for connectors. A curved connector starting at point 1 may end at any of the other points of that rectangle; only the starting point itself isn't available as end point. In other words: starting point and end point can't be identical: Combine two or three connectors. Two are sufficient to draw a loop (). Three are required if the loop should be symmetric (). 

Yes - you can use the function to find the last row matching a certain criteria. This way, you can calculate the based on the first row. It would look like this: 

The default currency can be set using the global language options. Go to Menu -> -> -> , and select the appropriate currency from the default currency combobox: 

Here, you see a list of styles and a table with the heading levels 1 to 10. LibreOffice will ignore all styles in the leftmost column ("") when creating the ToC. By default, the index heading is ignored, too. To let LO recognize that style, select the entry "" in the Styles list, and move it to the right, using the arrow buttons << / >>: 

In OpenOffice.org Writer, the icons may look different - see this wiki page and the following screenshot from the OOo Wiki: 

Assuming books are and chapters are : Just disable outline numbering for level 2, and change the numbering scheme for to, e.g., . To do so: 

LibreOffice / OpenOffice writer can create and maintain indices automatically. You just have to define the index entries. To create a index entry, select the word to put in the index, and select Menu "" -> "" -> "": 

You don't write that you've added any index entries. It's possible to create an index even there are no index entries defined, but in this case, the index stays empty until you define which entries to put into the index. The LO documentation is a little bit misleading in that point - there's an own chapter on . The OpenOffice.org Writer documentation explains all steps together. 

Put an apostrophe () before the string, telling Calc that the data following should be treated as a string; As already mentioned: use formatting to set the cell content to "text". 

Double-click on the top ruler at the position where you want to place the tabstop. The "" dialogue will open, showing the newly inserted tabstop and its position in the tabs list at the left. 

Move the cursor to where the reference should appear; Menu "Insert" -> "Field" -> "More fields", or hit CTRL+F2 On the cross-reference tab, from the "Type" Listbox, select "Insert Reference"; in the Selection List, select the name set in step 3a; in the "Insert reference to" listbox, select "Reference" (double-click OR single click + Insert Button): 

You will have to insert the field manually only the first time. Afterwards, just copy and paste the second, "margin" frame besides any object you want to count. If want want complete flexibility, use the / field type instead. 

Since cut&paste operations are sometimes quite annoying, you may create a simple macro for cutting cells and another one to paste them, moving existing content down. Here's a very simple code to "move" selected cells: 

If you still have the raw data (spreadsheet) available, using LibreOffice, you could just modify the page properties, and tell LO Calc to print the sheet on one huge, custom-sized page. You'll have to switch between the page properties and the "Page Break" view to check if the page size is big enough for your sheet's data area. To adjust the appropriate settings, select Menu -> . On the tab, at the ComboBox, select , and set the page dimensions manually: 

Take care to adapt the semicola depending on your localisation, and make sure that regular expressions are enabled in the settings (Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice Calc -> Calculate). 

Select the paragraph between the two frames and open the paragraph style options (using Menu -> or the context menu: right-click and select ). In the paragraphy style options, select the tab (1) and add a bottom border by clicking in the area as illustrated (2): 

Finally, update the default style with your custom settings. To do so, double-check that your "template" frame is selected, and that the "Frame" default style is selected. Then, on the rightmost button in the Styles and Formatting window, click on the small arrow pointing downwards (see below - dark green), and select "" (below, light green): 

As result, you have an additional column with a flag for all rows that are duplicates and have an . Now, you can apply an (Menu "" -> "" -> "") and filter for rows with that flag: 

Grouping or outlining data is quite easy if there's a clear structure in the data. For example, assuming that your first example contains sum rows for each of the three groups (E7, E13 and E19 are each the sum of the five cells above): 

A possible solution would be to save the table in a separate document and link it using OLE. This way, you can use the full power of LibreOffice / OpenOffice Calc when working with your table. To implement it, do the following: 

The Apache PDFBox library comes with some command line tools. Here's an example how to encrypt a file using PDFBox on the command line: 

AFAIK unlinking isn't possible, but why not copying the complete sheet? This way, you get a second/third copy of your data series without manually selecting / copying / inserting the data anywhere else. 

Select the range of cells; Open Menu "" -> "" In the following dialogue, select "" from the first ComboBox; Enter the following formula into the text field: 

Just disable recording changes. Recording changes is a feature to keep some "metadata" about edits concerning your spreadsheet. It allows you to track some data about which changes were applied to the sheet, so a third person may review and acccept/reject the changes. When recording is enabled, every cell that was changed since is highlighted by a thin red border, and a popup informs about recent changed. You can control recording of changed using Menu "" -> "". There, you will find also a feature to disable recording of changes: disable "". You will be asked for confirmation, but if you're not interested in the data recorded, you can safely confirm. "Data recorded" means the info in the popup box - date, time and content of edits regarding the specific cell, not the data in the cell itself. 

This will insert footnotes for each comment, copying the comment's text and removing the comment afterwards. 

Converting a simple table (as your table 1) to a contingency table (as your table 2) is a standard task for a pivot table. Depending on your data, it may be useful to prepare the contents before creating the pivot table: 

In your document, enter and select the text "Open Source"; Right-click on selection, select ""; on the "" tab, select "" as language for those two words; click OK; While the two words are still selected, open menu "" -> "" or hit SHIFT+F3; Optionally, select the category; Enter a describing name and a shortcut (for example ); Hit button AutoText and select entry "" (don't select "", since this will strip the language setting from the new AutoText entry). Hit OK. 

you can toggle the option . The symbol at the right of the word shows the bullet type LO will insert instead of the dash you've entered. EDIT: To change the bullet symbol, do one of the following (after enabling the option): 

Make sure you're working with Paragraph Styles if you want to format cells: The cell formatting depends on the Paragraph style of its content If you've created a new style as you've described, make sure that it has the desired style definitions. You can access (and modify) them using the "" entry from the style's context menu (again, OOo docs): 

Yes, this is possible (i tested it with LibreOffice 3.5 - but i'm sure it works the same way with OpenOffice):
