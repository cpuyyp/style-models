I'm not sure of this, but you should see if there are any Lego products that could be used, such as Mindstorms. They've got robotics that are controlled by your computer, so if you build a dog feeder with them, and then remote to your computer, you should be able to control it, right? Add one of the lego cameras to see how it works, and improve on the design. 

I want to install an anti-virus, but the downloads (AVG) need me to connect to the internet to install. Isn't it dangerous to connect to the internet before I've installed the anti-virus? Oh, and this is an ancient laptop and I've just re-installed Win98 (the only legal OS I had on hand). But that shouldn't matter. I do have my XP computer to get the files, and that has the anti-virus installed. 

All Programs, Accessories, Command Prompt -- that's as close to a DOS box as you get, but it still takes the old DOS commands: dir, cd, etc. 

Do you work on multiple projects? If so, I might suggest under Development to then have subdirectories for each project, plus a directory for common or library code. Under that have the documents, the software, the database info, etc, like you have above. 

Well, it is still in your clipboard, ready to paste. If you get lost, you could do another paste to an empty text file, and see where you were by what was pasted. 

I recently converted to Windows 7 and I usually have Office Communicator running. When someone else instigates a conversation with me, the notification pops up, but behind everything else, and as just another item in the taskbar. How do I make it pop up, so I notice that someone is trying to contact me? It does flash once, but if I'm already in another conversation, it's very easy to overlook that a new window has opened. And if I overlook that flash, then there's very little to make me notice it after that. 

Ports 8000 and 8080 often are used for Proxy server functionality. Maybe you have ICS (Internet connection sharing) or something similar enabled that is blocking this port. You should also check if maybe falsely two instances of your server are running. 

Afaik, if you create a FTP share, then you can set the user rights only per share, but not per subfolder. That is because the FTP server usually has no control over the shared content (files, subfolders). You'd have to apply additional user rights e.g. from the operating system, but they cannot be combined with FTP, because all FTP users are given the OS user acoount rights under which the FTP server runs. Conclusion: it's not possible in the way you try to do it. But you could for example create another FTP share, which targets the subfolder directly, and give it different user rights, which are those that you want for this subfolder. 

The shutdown command DOES work, but you need to enable it on the target Computer. Therefore search the Internet for "remote shutdown token filter policy". Secondly you need to authenticate on the remote Computer in order to be allowed to execute the showdown. The shutdown command does not provide a functionality to transmit logon credentials, so you need to send them on a different way before doing the shutdown. I suggest you map a network drive for that purpose. Works well for me. You don't need to create a network share on the target just for that, use IPC$ instead. Notice: you need to logon on the target with credentials of the target Computer! The local rights of these credentials are not relevant; the target user may not even exist locally. AND the target user must have sufficient privileges to shut down the target. 

I don't know how to do from command line, but 7zip has an easy to use wrapper DLL for C#, "SevenZipSharp", which allows you to create archives or unpack them. And in the same program you could test the content of the folders in which you unpacked the data. Let me know if you need code samples. 

So, you have Windows Vista, and these are probably icons on the desktop that appear momentarily after login and then disappear. And it only happens every 2 weeks or so. Is there anything in your start menu or some task that starts that might be causing this? I would think something that is trying and failing to completely start might be at fault, but that should happen on every startup. So, perhaps something that is starting, and trying to do a periodic update is at fault. Perhaps a registry cleanup will help. As for praying to Saint William -- that will only work if you pay him well. If you don't pay the exorcist, your computer is likely to be repossessed! 

If you're willing to consider a third-party tool, I would recommend BeyondCompare. It's easy to use, it has a very generous trial before buying, fairly low price, and is nice for both comparing and merging many different file types and directories, including Excel. You can copy individual lines from one file to the other. (I'm a BC user, and have nothing to do with the company.) 

I've got a 84 page document that is over 13M in size! Another related document is much less than 1M, and it has a similar number of pages, pictures and tables. Is there a way to compact or clean up .docx files? It just doesn't make sense that it is that huge! It was initially created as a .doc file, and that old copy is huge too. 

After buying several dead and almost dead batteries, my neighbor has started taking a battery tester with her to the store. She buys the battery, opens it right then and checks it, so it's easy to replace if it isn't any good. 

There aren't any options to change that, no checkbox to unclick. How do I change it so it will kill the previous instance? Or, to a more basic question, what likely happened to cause this to start being a problem (because it has worked well for a few years)? I think the machine is Windows 7 professional. 

The ~120MB/s speed that you see is pretty standard for a hard disk, and indicates that the hard disk is the bottleneck - not the USB connection. 120MB/s comes to 960Mb/s (bytes vs bits), which is well within the theoretical 5Gb/s maximum of USB 3.0. Writing a 4TB disk at this rate will indeed come to ~8.8 hours, and I would strongly advise against this approach for a 12TB disk. 

And piping the output into . is taking fields 2, 4 and 5 (, and ) doing a calculation, and storing them in variables , , and . 

There are similar observations with , for example: stair-stepping when using a pty (through ssh) and piping to more 

If you are keen to improve the web performance of B's connection, then you could look into a caching proxy, but this won't help with lots of things such as streaming videos or large portions of the dynamic content found on the web today which is (by nature) impossible to cache. 

For future reference, it's really not a good idea to have two power supplies connected together. For example: 

The problem I'm seeing is that PC 1 cannot (will not) communicate with PC 2, but my phone will. Of course my phone has the ability to hop over and connect to the extender directly, and I can't currently rule that out as playing a part here. The same situation stands for PC 1 trying to communicate with other hosts on the WiFi extender. All hosts have access to the internet. 

Summary Unfortunately there aren't really any good / reliable steps you can take to facilitate "removing a mounted SD Card without going through a software/OS unmounting process" and not running into problems. Moral of the story - figure out a way to and it correctly to ensure that filesystem data is contiguous, and that no s are in progress when the user does disconnect it. 

(It seems like this must have already been asked, but I'm not finding it.) I have a Word 2010 document, and I want to make a link in one part of the document pointing to another part of the same document. I have a table that needs to be filled out, and in the instructions about the table, I want to link to it. That way, they can easily get to the table referenced. 

In Outlook 2007 on a company network, I can see my contact information with I select the To button on new email, and find myself in the address book. The phone number is empty. If I right-click and choose Properties, I can see all my information. But it's not letting me edit this. Is this something that is edited and saved elsewhere? If so, where? Or, is it something that only the Exchange Administor or some other admin can edit? 

I have two Excel (.xls) files that I'm comparing using Beyond Compare 3. When a record is different, it's messing up the alignment, and it doesn't fix itself for several records, so I'd like to manually realign the compare. According to their help, I right-click on a line and choose align. Except that align isn't on the right-click menu. Why? I'm comparing as 'Detected (MS Excel Workbooks)', Showing All. 

What is the proper way for a student to open a new document? When she chooses OneDrive for Business, it does open a new document. But, since she's a student, not a business, I don't know how successful that will be, or if that is the proper direction. 

I recently re-installed the OS on an old laptop, and just noticed that it seems to have some pretty bad keybounce. Could that be that I need to find and install a driver for the keyboard, or is it more likely that it is just an old laptop and is wearing out? I didn't notice the keybounce before the reinstall. 

I have a put a border/frame around a text paragraph, that spans over 3 pages. It is a code sample. The frame has a vertical line at the top of the paragraph on the first page, then 2 vertical lines at the sides of the paragraph also on the first page, and then an unwanted horizontal line inside the paragraph at the end of the 1st page. So, the frame is closed at the end of this page, although the code sample continues on the next. Same procedure at the 2nd page, it starts with the horizontal frame line, although the paragraph has started at the previous page. Using a 1-cell table is not an option either, it also has the unwanted horizontal lines at page ends/beginnings. Is there any option to avoid the closing of the frame at page ends and "reopening" at page beginnings? I only want the vertical lines as long as the paragraph has not ended. 

Spoiler: There will be a YES answer at the bottom of the post Short answer: NO. Medium-sized answer: NO, because there are 2 processes that want to access one ressource (the hard disk) at the same time. Each process will read different data, so the head needs to jump to the place where the process needs data from the platter. This jumps take a lot of time and decrease the total throughput of your hard-disk a lot! Long answer, because you seem to lack some (basic) understanding of the working principle of a hard disk: NO, because your spinning platters hard drive behaves like a book. Imagine that you have a book with only empty pages. That's your hard disk when you buy it. No data stored on it. Then you put it into your computer (let's say as a 2nd drive, so we don't have to deal with the operating system here). When you write a long text document (called 'text A') and save it on the disk, then it's like writing the first 10 pages (pages 1 to 10) in your book. Then you copy a jpg picture onto the disk, that's like make a drawing of your house on the next 5 free pages in your book (p. 11-15). The table of content of your book now has 2 entries: 

You could look at - mounting a directory via SSH rather than transferring the files back and forth. In this case you would connect to the server and mount your PC's directory. You could then operate directly on the files, before unmounting and disconnecting. Depending on the network, you might need to forward your local SSH server's listening port. It's FUSE so there is no need for root / sudo. 

I mentioned that the keyboard's controller may ignore keys that are 'always pressed'... Due to the way that the keys are wired, this can have additional (and unexpected) behaviours, such as preventing other keys from working. Look into Key Rollover for more info. 

To be honest, every connector I can think of follows the rule above, excluding only some Micro USB connectors which have been mounted upside down, notably by Samsung on phones including the S4. Unfortunately this then leads you on to ask "what is the top-side of the PCB?" - a question that from the outside of a product can be difficult to answer. There are then other standards at play - PC form factor standards such as ATX vs. BTX lead to products which have the motherboard mounted on the other side and add-in cards mounted upside down when compared to each other. This leads not only to the connectors being "upside down", but also the motherboard being mounted on the "wrong side". These things aren't consistent because there are too many things at play here. Take the S4 example I gave above... perhaps the engineers working on that PCB considered the "top side" to be the side facing away from the user - it would make sense, as lots of the components are mounted on that side to leave a flush bottom side against the display module. 

From your extra information, it looks like you've downloaded the wrong thing, or the download service is broken at their end. should work, but it might be worth trying to mirror the remote repository to a local repository instead:
