If that works, put the setting in your ~/.bashrc file to load it automatically. If you prefer vi(m), you can do this: 

The flag simulates commands. You can run such a command as a regular user, and there's no danger of actually harming your system. It allows you to see easily what the proposed action would do. One thing to keep in mind is that this sort of check will show you gross breakage, but it won't show broader mistakes. What I mean is you might be able to remove package Foo without truly breaking your system, but it may severely limit the usefulness of package Bar. In general, packages are chained together through recommendations to prevent just this, but it's worth keeping in mind. You can also search for dependencies and reverse dependencies using , but I find the simulated run is the most vivid way of seeing what will happen. 

Original version: The article that John links to suggests that you use the installer disc to repair a lost admin password, but since you mention that you're far from an installer disc, I will mention that there is an old Unix hack available. (Edit: Just to clarify, once upon a time there was another answer here that linked to this Apple support page. I still think that's a useful page to have linked as part of this discussion, so I'm putting it into this answer. Also, I don't want anyone thinking I imagined another answer.) 

If as you say the system is otherwise fine, you could consider preventing this from being run at startup. There are 2 approaches, the simple one via msconfig and the advanced one via AutoRuns. You can use msconfig to control what starts up when your system starts, but do NOT proceed unless you know how to recover your system if it becomes unbootable. 

Start -> Run -> cmd (right-click, Run as Administrator) Agree to the UAC dialog Type iisreset, hit enter 

The IP-based captive portals I've seen work by altering ("rewriting") the destination IP before passing the packet on; then, in cases where the captive portal is the same box as the router, the packet is passed to the internal interface instead of the WAN side. On the way back to the captive machine (ie. client), the source IP is rewritten, so the captive machine thinks it's talking to its original destination. Search online for DNAT if you want to know more. Side note - it works nicely for HTTP, but causes mayhem for other apps such as IM. A cleaner solution would be to operate above the IP layer: use a transparent HTTP proxy which issues 301s to captive machines, combined with dropping all non-HTTP traffic coming from captive machines, but the user has to use a browser to give their credit card details (or whatever releases them from being captive.) 

That allows you to create a new function on the fly and have it be immediately available once you're done editing.

This doesn't get you only the packages you installed. It also gets their dependencies, etc. Also, if the repositories between the two machines are different, all bets are off. As far as logs, keeps a log at (thanks to Tshepang for updating this in a comment); does (at ), but it's famously hard to parse and can only be read with root privileges; has one at and you can page through it with regular user privileges. As far as I can tell, you are right that none of these logs track specifically what you installed as opposed to auto-installed dependencies. You can get that information, however, from an search. Search for all installed packages that were also installed automatically: 

(I've got nothing on RedHat or RedHat-based systems. Sorry. There really is no one answer for Linux per se since package management is a big part of what makes different distros different.) 

By putting after and , Mac upends the whole system. Normally, you can put something into (say a second Perl interpreter, compiled in some non-standard way), and then a regular user will hit the custom one rather than the system-wide one first. This is good. Users can get variants, but the system stays pure. In any case, you can put things (as is normal) into , but if there is something by the same name already in or , that will get found first. To fix this, you can change the regular user's by editing the .profile file in the user's home directory. (That file doesn't exist initially, but you can create it easily.) I do that soon after I start any new Mac. Semi-related: Homebrew provides excellent package management for Macs. By default, Homebrew installs software into , but it does so in a way that makes it very easy to remove things and return to a vanilla state later. 

Interestingly enough, this seems to no longer be an issue. The Anti-virus program was automatically run and although it didn't find anything, after rebooting I can again have the mouse all the way at the top of the screen and still select the top window. 

Open up your *.csv file in Notepad, hold the key and at the start of the first line, drag your mouse all the way down to the last row to enable . Then type in 5 commas, which will populate them on all lines. Alternatively, you can hold down + and then use the arrow keys This also gets around having to open the file in Excel which can cause issues with the original data. EDIT: After some quick research, it appears that this is not supported using the native application in Windows, but is supported in multiple other editor applications. You can download something like (Freeware) to accomplish this. 

Clicking on the top bar with mouse pointer at top of screen deselects the window (if active) or does not select it (if not active): Notice the color of the window's bar, in the second screenshot it is lighter (meaning not active). 

I've been having an odd issue, while minor is rather annoying using Windows 7 x64. For some reason starting a few weeks ago, if my mouse pointer is at the very top of the screen and I click on an window that is maximized, it does not select it and actually deselects it if it is the active window; I need to move the mouse pointer further down on the title bar to select the application. It seems as though while an application is maximized it doesn't actually include the top row of pixels. This has not always been the case as I have always moved the mouse to the very top of the screen when selecting another window to be active. Any ideas what would be causing this? Clicking on the top bar selects window per usual: 

Are you trying to edit the file with or MacVim? If you're using the system's default command line (the one Apple provides), it probably lacks support for many things Janus relies on. If you are using MacVim, then maybe you accidentally got a much older version? Since you say you're on Snow Leopard, you should go with the very latest snapshot release from the downloads page on Github 

EDIT August 31, 2013: Current versions of Ruby don't need this patch any longer (Ruby has it by default). However, there is still one thing that can go wrong. You must make sure that Ruby is built as a shared library. If Vim crashes in the same way, it probably has to do with this issue. Make sure to add your configure options include . (See this bug report for further discussion.) 

I use shell functions for things that are reasonably small and self-contained, and that are helper commands for the shell rather than full programs in their own right. Once something becomes a proper program, I write it up as such and move it to the bin directory in my folder (which is already in my ). Here's an example: 

Cron runs under a very minimal environment. Supply explicit, full paths for all shell commands (e.g., instead of and so on - check where the relevant items are first with and so on), and it will likely run fine. 

Have a look at the -x option, that'll create a directory structure, not sure if it'll save the filenames correctly but the doco suggests so. $URL$ 

You're looking for an entry that mentions msiieb32.dll. If you see one, try unchecking it and restarting the system. If you don't see it, go download AutoRuns ( $URL$ and take a look in the various tabs for something mentioning msiieb32.dll, but be aware: this is a powerful tool which can make your system permanently unbootable. Don't just click stuff you don't understand - it's YOUR responsibility to make sure YOU know what impact YOUR changes will have on YOUR system, BEFORE you make the change. Hope that helps you down the right path. 

Check scheduled tasks have the correct credentials. Enable login auditing if it's not already enabled (refer to $URL$ Disable account lockout (it's disabled on my system, so I guess that's the default): 

Trying to optimize my day here, making do with IIS... When executing IISRESET from the Run dialog or from cmd.exe, I get an access denied error. So executing IISRESET gets annoying - involving both mouse and keyboard: 

I use Google Talk to check my gmail. For reasons unknown to me Google Talk insists on opening Firefox when I receive an email and click on the popup. Is there a way to make it open links in Chrome instead? 

Since Snow Leopard is going to be the default on new machines as of Friday, and Apple makes machines with a lot less RAM than 4GB, I would assume that it will work just fine. Having said that, I don't have any machine with more than 2.4GB of RAM (various OS X and Debian machines), and I never hit a wall the way you say you do. So, maybe you're crunching numbers in a way that requires a lot of memory. (Apple is making a big deal (and rightfully so) out of the fact that Snow Leopard takes up less space on your hard drive than Leopard, but this doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of memory consumption.) 

The chapter on installing software is split between deb based (Debian based) systems and rpm based (Red Hat based) systems, so that should work for Fedora. 

There are other questions, too, like "How common are the tools to manipulate the resulting archives?" So, for example, creates smaller files than , but it can take significantly longer. Also, in my experience is universal on Unix-like systems, but is still not (though it's very common and usually easy to get). 

Copy the file to the new machine (a thumb drive is a good option, but also works fine). Then run this sequence (with root privileges): 

The problem is that by putting /usr/local/bin so late, the system-wide Python (which is at /usr/bin and so earlier in your $PATH) keeps getting hit. My answer is to make my $PATH look like this on a Mac: 

One thing you could do is to save the excel file as a file, open it up with NotePad and hold while selecting with your mouse to enable the Box Selection. That way you can select all of the "Hello"s you want to remove at once. You could also use and put 'hello ' in the box, leave the box empty and hit Replace All 

How do I remove this part of the rule if it's not included in the list? As mentioned this is part of every rule I create and I have 20-30 of them, so as of now it's impossible for me to have more than one rule run automatically for incoming e-mails. 

I have several rules on Outlook 2010 to automatically sort my incoming mail. Whenever I add a new rule I get the warning 

I did some research and it looks like a lot of the times the issue is that rules have as part of them. I checked and literally every one of my rules have this condition. The issue, however, is that there is no way to remove this condition. Doing research, the condition should be listed as one of them to check when adding/editing a rule and in all screenshots I could find it is the first one on the list. However, it is not included anywhere on the list. Please see the screenshots of the Edit Rules Window below: 

I know that you can use FIGNORE to remove filename completion from suffixes. For example, to avoid a lot of garbage files produced by LaTeX, I've been using: 

Note that the variable is assigned without a dollar sign ( or ), but when you use it, you need or . So you would want something like this: 

I've had good experiences with TuxMobil. The site is nicely organized, so that you can choose a manufacturer and model, then follow links to see how specific distros and versions worked on that hardware. (The links go offsite to blogs, forums, etc. so the quality of reports will vary. However, I have found many to be very detailed and helpful.) A similar site is Linux on Laptops. (Probably many of their links overlap, but just in case one has links the other doesn't, I'll post both.) 

Boot the system into recovery mode. To do this, reboot and hold down Command and the 'r' key at the same time. Launch a terminal and enter . This will launch a window. From there, you can choose what user you want to reset the password for (including root, if you've enabled root). 

The browser picks up on the link type and offers to subscribe you. I'm surprised to hear that Chrome doesn't recognize these. (Perhaps that's platform specific?)
