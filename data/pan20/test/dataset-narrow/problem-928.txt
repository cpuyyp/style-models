Wait for few seconds for Network Manager to detect the new driver installation and check if Wifi is functional. 

Because the partition F: is marked as System Partition which I think is your current Windows-7 installation drive. You can not remove a partition while its in use, in this case your Windows is running and all critical system files are in use. You can either use some Live bootable Media or Windows Installation drive to delete and create partitions. 

Not sure what the problem might be but you can try repairing MBR and see if it works. To repair MBR and restore Windows 7 boot loader follow these steps: 

Assuming everyone has their Dropbox Account and has not shared any folder. To share a Common folder among users. Just create a New Shared Folder and Invite other users with whom you want to share this folder. Or if you want to share an existing folder and enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite. A more detailed guide can be found here: How do I share folders with other people? 

Replace with the full path of the folder location. Usually Desktop is Located at replace with the your username. To assign Control Permissions use following command 

KeyTweak does a pretty good job of remapping keys and it is fairly simple. Ill let you decide if its simple enough for your needs but this is the best solution I know of 

I have an hp pavilion dv6000 laptop that gives me this error 0x000000f when starting up. So I tried to reinstall windows using the recovery partition and that makes it to 11% recovery and then freezes and wont go any farther. I have tried memtest and Ive tried booting with only half the memory but it still doesnt work. Any ideas? 

Im pretty sure the disk you are talking about is for recovery purposes. If you want to insure your computer against a hard drive crash i would say get the disk. I know that as a pc tech it makes it alot easier on us to get your new hard drive running if you have your own disks 

You will see your missing folders/files which were hidden by the virus. navigate through your these folders and just copy the files in them to a new location. If neither of those work try this data recovery tool 

If you insist on downloading crap the only way to keep it clean is to reinstall windows periodically like once a month or so or whenever it gets slow 

first, if you've just deleted it, chances are the file is still on your hard drive. you need to IMMEDIATELY do a check for Unerase of recently deleted files. And DO NOT SAVE ANYTHING NEW TO THIS DRIVE!!! "Deleted" files aren't actually deleted.. The drive directory has simply been modified to remove their 'location' tabs, and the associated space is now free for use again.. So as soon as you save another file, it may overwrite that area, at which point your chances of getting those files back decrease exponentially. Using a high quality app like FileSalvage or DiskDrill, you can unerase those drives.. howevr, you can't install it on that drive (due to the fact that installation or running that drive may well overwrite the files)... SO. you need to NOT run that machine; shut it down and boot it only in Target Disk mode, then do a recovery from another machine.. This takes time, but it's one of the consequences of deleting something that you needed. If you have a TimeMachine drive, you can probably go to that drive and recover it via Time Machine. 

There is a significant procedural difference between copying a 60gb file to a drive, and copying 600 10mb files to a drive.. file transfer processes include a 'handshake' and verification process for every packet transferred, generally occurring after a file has completed, so the complete file is verified. This process adds additional time to the transfer of a file. If you're transferring ONE file, it's going to happen once. Or with 600 files....well, 600 times. additionally, if you're running over USB2, that pipeline is quite likely the culprit - - USB 2 is ony 480mbit/second, which is rather slow and tedious, and due to the 60,000+ times your drive is going to be copying/handshaking/verifying, it's going to take a. very. long. time... if you are wanting to do a backup of data like this, a better way to do it is to do a tgzip or compression of the files to fewer larger files, then copy these over.. however, if you do that, don't think that you'll save time, if you're planning to 'unzip' them on the other end! The real difference between internal and external is that your internal drive is running a 'pipeline' that's ~45x's LARGER & FASTER than your external USB drive. It is a huge difference... This makes a tremendous difference when it comes to duplicating numerous files such as your description: You're able to copy & verify hundreds of files at a time, whereas an external USB2 port will do only a couple at a time. A simple analogy of this would be about the process of filling a gallon pail of water. Your external USB2 port would be the equivalent of a drinking straw....it'll take a while, and you'll have to stop and take breathes while getting it going... Your internal drive would be the equivalent of using a garden hose.. It'll be done in only a few seconds.... IF your system is duplicating OFF the internal drive to the external, quite likely your system isn't going to let the internal drive be 'free' for other activity, effectively 'locking up' the system, and leading you to think the system is frozen up during this time... 

It will run those things fine. It wont be the fanciest or fastest thing in the world but for someone on a budget it will fulfill your needs. I prefer windows 7 to Vista but for the average user (from your question I would put you in that category) Vista will work 

I have an hp pavilion dv6000 that was having windows issues recently including randomly freezing. I eventually concluded that the hard drive was bad (And I was correct as the bad drive started making funny noises and quit working soon after). So I replaced it with a known good drive and put windows on it and it worked for a few hours. After a few restarts startup didn't even make it to the login screen. It just stays at a lighted black screen until I restarted. After another restart it made it to windows but then froze after a few minutes. A few more restarts yielded one of these two results. Like I mentioned earlier I have a know good drive in it and I also replaced the memory that was in it with a know good stick along with running memtest with no errors. So What does that leave? a corrupted windows installation? Motherboard? CPU? Any ideas? 

RPM packages are precompiled and built for and can be installed only using , and RPM based package managers. Since Kali Linux is based on Debian you can not install RPM packages directly using or package managers. However, you can try a utility called Alien which can convert one package format into other but this doesn't mean every RPM will work since packages link to another packages for dependencies and this can cause troubles. To install Alien and necessary package, run this command 

Use following commands to restore MBR: Or rewrite new boot sector on system partition: Reboot system and see if it works. 

Regarding your Original Question, the JAR file you are downloading is meant for Java Micro Edition running on Mobile Devices. So you cannot directly run those JAR'S on PC unless you have a mobile emulator (here) As you have stated in your comment you only want to test if a JAR file is runnable or not, you can find various online. One of them Tic-Tac-Toe. Or you can pack your own JAR and test them. 

You can simply change your default download directory in Google-Chrome. Go to Under Downloads , change your to wherever you want. 

do you have a separate boot drive or bootable thumbdrive available?? If so, boot from it (hold option when you power-on, and it'll bring up the bootloader to give you the choice of available drives for booting).. if you can boot from a known-good boot drive, then you know the issue is either your original hard drive (and please tell us you've got a good timemachine back up of your drive, considering that you're running your computer on a hard drive built in 2006, and has the equivalence of 600,000 miles on it!!). if i had to guess, my initial guess would be that you have a bad/dying hard drive, causing issues. frankly, I wouldn't do a thing before a bought a SSD drive and an adaptor on amazon, installed them in one the bays, and reinstalled a fresh OS on it.. that's the first step. if you've been able to get it up on ANY drive to look at data on the unit, run anything more than 3 or 4 minutes, then it's VERY unlikely to be the power supply. highly unlikely the RAM.. you might take the door off, and look at the ram slots while running-there are some error lights on the cards - you'll see them if they're on... (don't pull cards out while it's running) 

If repairing MBR doesn't work for you then maybe your installation is corrupted or drive is failing, I suggest you to take backup of data using some live CD and then reinstalling Windows. Hope this helps you. 

System Volume Information stores your System Restore Data. If you want to reduce the size Just go to Select the drive for which you want to reduce size. Select configure and Adjust the Max Usage. This will reduce the number of files and restore states you can have. More space means longer term backup and less means less restore points and less term backup.

Actually I would say the problem is with the hard drive itself especially since you say it made a funny noise. In my experience with this issue 95% of the time the hard drive ended up being replaced. Some things you can try to verify this: 

Try Firebug 1.5a21, $URL$ Its a know bug and they dont know why it does that. Also Ive heard that after reinstalling it it will work for a while but thats more of a workaround 

I downloaded an ISO of Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit From Digital River to try to restore a laptop. I downloaded the ISO and burned it to a Memorex DVD and tried to boot the laptop from it using the boot options but the laptop acted like there was no disk in the drive and booted from the Hard Drive like normal. I tried another boot disk to see if it was the DVD drive but the laptop booted to that disk just fine. Am I burning this disk wrong? Any ideas? Lenovo g570 

It is likely recoverable. But it's not free and it's not always easy. You will need a scavaging-capable disk recovery app. 

Either one is a definite hardware 'code red' situation... If you CAN get it mounted, copy EVERYTHING of value off immediately. 

The gradient grey makes me think the LCD is bad (or a cracked/shorted LVDS cable). The hard shut-down is a solid indicator that you've got a serious hardware issue. i would try starting in safe mode (boot and hold the SHIFT key until you've got the apple and the "grey grinding wheel").... IF the unit will boot in safe mode then its MORE LIKELY the GPU chip (logic board) than the LCD. Either way, (LCD or logic board), I'd not put any money into this system - it's well beyond its prime and I'd very heartily recommend an upgrade.. The logic boards are known for failure... There is NO separate "power supply" in this era system - if it's got a power system issue, it would be on board the logic board, in which case you need to say a prayer and bury it. 

*these may not work well with missing partitions. You'll most likely need to buy one of these (I don't know what end-user pricing is, but on a pro level, most run $200+), and then run it. Oh, and don't plug your drive in again or turn it on, until you have one of the apps to work on recovery. You're just as likely to bugger it as to fix it. Or you could find a company who does this and get it to them. it's not going to be cheap/free, unless you REALLY get lucky. that's one of the breaks of jacking around with partitions and directories... For what you've described, I'd try DiskDrill...
