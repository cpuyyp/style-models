Well, you can rasterise the output and post-process it with an image manipulation tool. Heres an example 

Your domain hosting provider will have a point and click GUI for you to add these records, you don't have to do it using a text editor. However exactly what the GUI tools look like, and how to use them, depend on exactly which domain hosting service you are using. In the case of the problem you describe, these records are probably set up correctly, you want to host both example.com and example.org on the same server. HTTPD Here's an example configuration for Apache HTTPD 

Update: It is possible to make Apache serve a HTTPS page (via a back-end script) that shows the text file in a textarea and use (It's All Text to launch any local text editor. This obviously requires some care regarding security. 

You can buy various Lucida fonts but exclusive rights to Lucida Grande are owned by Apple. Lucida Grande is copyright by the font designers Bigelow and Holmes but is not available for sale. 

† The intro to my answer may seem a bit flippant but the important point here is that a very important part about troubleshooting is challenging your assumptions. Another important point about stackexchange sites is that questions need answers. Not least so that they disappear from the list of unanswered questions. Comments help the questioner improve their question but, unless they are acted on, they don't always move things along the road to closure. I've made this community wiki to make it clear I'm not just harvesting reputation points. ‘I thought dwarfs loved gold,’ said Angua. ‘They just say that to get it into bed.’ replied Cheery. 

wget 1.13 checks environment variables curl 7.22 checks environment variables wget can read these settings from curl can read these settings from 

Most JPEG images probably still use the 1992 JPEG Codec and the EXIF and JFIF file formats. So those are probably what a lot of software still assumes. 

There are several ways to achieve what you want. I think you want the first of these. Su - When you su to root, specify that you want root's environment by adding "-" to the command. 

I found a recipe for the solution at $URL$ which caused me to check the audit.log - In there I noticed and (i.e. lp command denied) Gory details follow in case they help anyone else 

I'd try .xbm (X11 bitmap format) as the file type. See BMP and XBM in $URL$ Also, you don't need to use JPEG as an intermediate format. Use .xbm in the first command and omit the second. 

This sounds like a very unusual arrangement. I'm used to ADSL where the router/modem handles the authentication transparently for all connected PC's regardless of whether they use HTTP at all. The authentication you describe sounds more like the system used at Internet cafes. I believe some WiFi routers support this (for people who share WiFi access with customers or friends). Perhaps your ISP is storing authentication-state in a client-side session cookie? In which case your second login probably invalidates the cookie stored at the first PC. It is possible your ISP's T&C's prohibit multiple PC's (perhaps they charge more for more simultaneously connected PCs) I'd call the ISP helpdesk. For more specific answers, try updating your question with the name & location of the ISP. 

In many countries, cable broadband is carried in underground conduits that are less likely to be hit by lightning. Some cable broadband is provided (at least partly) over optical cable which is not conductive and does therefore not transmit an electrical surge. Phone-line broadband can be supplied on phone lines that are suspended from telegraph poles above the ground, and are much more likely to be hit by lightning. In general, every conductive cable that enters your computer is a potential path for a destructive surge and might benefit from surge protection. This could include Ethernet cables, serial cables or perhaps USB cables that link to a device that has a separate connection to an unprotected electricity supply, etc. 

Sparks can occur when there is a poor electrical connection between a plug and an outlet/receptacle during insertion of the plug. If the outlet is switched, turn it off before inserting the plug. If sparks occur at the outlet when you turn the switch on it means the outlet or plug are defective. 

Using an Ethernet switch will mean that one PC can't view traffic directly between two other computers on the same LAN (older Ethernet hubs allowed PCs to capture such traffic). To prevent a PC from observing broadcast traffic sent by other PCs, you would have to place each PC into a separate broadcast domain. Some routers support VLANs, which is one way to achieve this. Place each PC into a separate VLAN. You can then use router rules to decide which traffic is allowed between PCs. This places a large load on your router and on it's administrator. You say "RouterTik OS" but if you mean a MikroTik wireless router running RouterOS then the above does not apply. Your MikroTik router may have settings that segregate PCs. 

Again, untested. You'll generate warnings if the data file contains headwords not in the key file. You can check for being undefined and if so print w/o key. 

That's a one bit difference. It doesn't look like crypto malware, maybe HD is going bad? The next day 

I believe markdown expects Unicode. perhaps you could try using recode to change the encoding from your default encoding to UTF8. 

Sorry, no idea, Fast enough for what? Activestate say "Komodo Edit is a fast, smart, free and open-source code editor." (my emphasis) 

Are you sure that you have all the hardware drivers that Windows XP would need on the NUC? So far as I can tell, Intel don't support XP. This is hardly surprising. HDD transplant You might be able to get somewhere by removing the NUC's hard disk, putting it into a PC that has USB2 or PS2 connectors, installing XP there then replacing the HD in the NUC and see if XP can boot in safe mode. If so you can then install the drivers needed for the NUC hardware. Assuming you have some drivers. PCIe Some NUCs have a PCIe slot. PCIe PS/2 cards exist. Whether XP would recognise them is pot-luck I guess. VM I'd prefer to try to install XP as a VM under Windows-10 (or some other supported OS or Hypervisor). 

Use an Ethernet cable on the router's LAN ports to link them. This means merging the two LAN subnets (with consequences for static routes and separation of DHCP pools etc). Otherwise you'd probably need another router to link the two LAN subnets. Your landlord's switch is probably configured to provide privacy to tenants from each other. Your ISP's gateway is a router and it is not normally the job of a router to facilitate local traffic - that's what switches are for. 

Generally, 2.5" drives can be USB powered. 3.5" drives often require more power than USB specifies. USB 2 allows max 500 mA at 5V nominal. 

I've omitted switch details, collisions, backoffs, throttling, re-transmits, spanning-tree, timeouts, NAT, three way-handshakes, concurrent persistent HTTP connections, and hundreds of other things that happen all the time. Filling in all the steps would take thousands of lines (if not tens or hundreds of thousands) like the above. 

Microsoft's Windows uses OpenType fonts. It also supports the older Truetype font system. Earlier versions of Windows could support Postscript Type 1 fonts by use of third-party products (e.g. from Adobe). Apple's OS-X uses AAT fonts. Recent versions of OS-X also have limited support for OpenType fonts. For best results it is better to repurchase a font in the native format of the platform than to attempt to convert them. Each font system has features that the others lack and which are not amenable to automatic translation. Programs such as Fontforge can convert the common features of fonts 

Perhaps you have a recovery CD/DVD that will replace it when doing a full restore (and overwriting all your important data) Perhaps ASUS website allows you to download an ISO or purchase a recovery CD/DVD? 

Occasionally I would like to view a particular message as "". But the problem is remembering to change this global setting back afterwards. Is there a keyboard shortcut (or similar convenient way) of viewing only the current message as "" without affecting the global settings? 

To convert PGP keys for use with SSH you probably need something like openpgp2ssh However, your system admin is being unhelpful. I'd give him or her the problem of supplying you with a key that can be used with Putty or I'd generate my own private key and SSH public key using Puttygen and ask the system admin to install the public SSH key in the necessary location on the server (as described in the man pages for sshd). If you have a username and password for the server and the systems admin has not blocked password authentication in sshd on the server, you can follow these instructions and do it all yourself. 

Perhaps you have something like a in the file association since running will immediately print the file on the default printer. 

This is likely to be easier than installing and configuring a full-blown web-server to do the same job. So if you map test.com to 127.0.0.1 in (or similar) you can then access $URL$ to reach your application listening on port 59873. 

(untested) The important point here is that it tests for an empty span element that happens to be all on the same line. You could add a caret (^) at the start if the unwanted span elements always start at the beginning of a new line. If you want to match you can do that, I doubt it is necessary. Any empty span element probably serves no useful purpose regardless of it's attributes. The only exception I can think of is if some javascript later populates those elements. 

Windows doesn't anti-alias fonts below a certain size - I believe this is font specific. Try a different font or try increasing the text size (Ctrl++ in many browsers) 

I don't know of a way to navigate to it in the sense of using it in conjunction with a command. You can invoke it thus: - which opens the folder in explorer if is a shortcut to something like 

If you have very deep pockets you could ask your lawyers to discuss with Microsoft lawyers whether you are legally bound by the above. 

Well, the DHCP server gets your MAC address from the DHCP request. It can include the offered IP-address in the reply packet's IP header (as well as in the DHCP payload) since it is only the MAC address that actually gets the delivery to the right destination. Update (WIkipedia) 

upc.biz wants you to type in personal details To reassure you that upc.biz is a website being run by UPC, upc.biz has presented you with a certificate saying "you can trust upc.biz, I vouch for them" signed Joe Smith. You have no idea who Joe Smith is. You have a list of signatures of people that Microsoft The Mozilla project say you can probably trust to introduce you to other people who are probably who they say they are, Joe smith isn't in that list of signatures (Certifying Authorities). The certificate is therefore worthless 

You might find attempting to get your old equipment working with virtualisation to be a complicated and frustrating experience. It may be a happier experience to just replace the equipment with recent versions that work with Windows 7. 

and then reviewing the contents of However adding the option would be an appropriate solution. A batch shell isnt like an interactive shell Generally, when running from cron there are some major differences to running interactively 

I would use a network sniffer like Wireshark (free) to see what Outlook does - Wireshark's "Follow TCP Stream" is useful for this. 

Because Microsoft prefer to provide GUI based tools for remote use of Windows. In particular Remote Desktop Protocol / Terminal Services. Historically, Microsoft have not, on the whole, been enthusiastic supporters or adopters of products and standards originating in the Unix or Internet communities. 

Cut your link, title and excerpt in the usual way - for example by selecting the text and pressing Ctrl+C To paste the link, title and excerpt press then then If you move focus from FreeClip back to the document you are editing then you'll have to switch focus back to Freeclip using before pressing , or . You can do all the above just by using the mouse if you prefer that to keyboard shortcuts. If you want a program that deletes an item from the clipboard when pasting or which , after a paste, moves a current pointer to an older cut item - this program isn't the one for you. 

normally you'd write as but when it is followed by digits you have to use {} to distinguish between the tenth remembered part $10 and the first part $1 followed by a literal 0. Used like this 

The main problem with longer LANs is signal attenuation. You can't avoid this only using "unlimited good wires" - you need powered active devices acting as signal repeaters to clean up and amplify the signal. 

From $URL$ In IE you can press Alt to show the menu-bar, choose "Manage Add-Ons", then disable anything associated with Verizon. At the very least, you can use this method to find out if your problem is caused by an Add-on. 

It depends who is using the term. If a computer hardware manufacturer such as Dell (or some firmware or software provided by them) uses the term, they mean that it resets the equipment to the state it was when it left the factory, with the same operating system version it had when it left the factory. If the term is used by the developer of a subsequently installed operating system, it may mean something different - for example a reset to the freshly installed state. Omitting subsequent OS and application updates and installs. Usually the term implies loss of user data - though this may not always be so. In short: caveat emptor. Backup important data regularly and check those backups are usable. Make an extra backup before doing anything described as a factory reset. 

If your operating system is a recent version of Windows and you have a system restore point just before the date you installed the magic-ivisual program, you could restore to that point. 

You want a program that will create, from a single program.exe a self-installing package that another person can use to install program.exe on their Windows computer and which will then show up in the control-panel remove-applications list with an uninstall optiion. The simplest I have found is probably Inno Setup. Like several such programs, you write a small text file to tell it what is to be included. Heres an example from an online tutorial
