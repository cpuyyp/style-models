is a many-to-many relationship between tables and . In this query, mysql will find all posts tagged by any of these words, and order them by PRIMARY KEY. How can we order the results by tag weight: 

Since, make the calculation for the entire column, apparently, I need to reset the value/process of after reaching the maximum item in folder. 

I want to SELECT or UPDATE to remove a row if the first or last (with id order) is (a given value). In other words, I want to skip the first and last row of a category IF . I cannot use as it is a table. 

is a big table, and I want to make the only if has found something. In other words, I do not want to make the for . 

I need to make heavy statistical analysis to deliver some data to users. Currently, I catch the data from mysql and process them via arrays. However, mysql temporary tables are quite better (extremely more efficient and faster than PHP arrays; obviously due to their mechanism). My tentative solution is to form a temporary table upon each request (i.e. connection) to import and process the data. However, I am not sure if there is a drawback for creating many temporary tables simultaneously? Can this make problem for the mysql server? Or I can use it as an alternative to PHP arrays in numerous simultaneous requests? 

I want to assign folder number to rows but limiting the number of items in each folder (e.g. 100). Thus, increasing the folder number (next folder) if . The d folder should look like 

I want to catch X rows, thus, I set ; but how can I simultaneously count the total number of rows too? Currently, I use two separate queries to do so as 

I use table for calculation of temporary data, but tables in has a big limitation, which made it useless for me. A table cannot be re-opened in a query. This mean I cannot the table with itself, and add sub-query. It is almost impossible to process data without and . Thus, I must give up table. A possible alternative is to create and delete a permanent table on each script run. However, I think it is not good from database administration point of view to and tables. Is there any practical alternative to tables with possibility of re-opening the table? 

and id is a in 5 child tables. Is it possible to drop TABLE , and force drop of all 5 child tables having ? instead of dropping child tables one by one? 

The Object Explorer view will not enumerate any of the tables or other objects in the AlwaysOn databases. Attempting to expand them results in an access denied message. You cannot have a Read Only and a non-Read Only connection to the same listener open at the same time. Intellisense for object names in the database does not work. (Oddly enough, Objects get enumerated just fine in the Query Designer that you can launch using Design Query in Editor... from the right-click menu.) Caveat 3 from the prior versions' caveats still applies. 

SQL Management Studio (versions prior to 2016) Unfortunately, there are some caveats that make using Application Intent in SQL Management Studio somewhat painful: To connect manually with ReadOnly intent, after bringing up the Connect to Server dialog from the Object Explorer, users must remember to: 

SQL Management Studio (versions 2016 or later) SQL Server Management Studio 2016 or higher can connect with Read Only Application Intent (using the same 6 steps as prior versions) and it does store the Additional Connection Parameters. There are still some caveats: 

Unfortunately, you cannot install SQL Express without Administrator rights on the machine and it's not something you can set in the config file or on the command line. If being able to install without Administrator rights is a requirement, you may want to investigate using SQL Server Compact Edition. See the following MSDN topics for more information: 

Third-Party Products LinqPad stores the whole connection string including Application Intent and the database when you save a connection and therefore might be a viable option for performing Read Only queries against Always On databases. 

The SQL Server is running normally and the SQL Browser service is started. Querying the SQL Browser service with another tool on the same server yields the expected results. I can run regular SQL queries with SQLCMD and get the expected results. I was able to verify that the output above is the same on a workstation where I caused SQLCMD -L to receive no responses at all by enabling the firewall; however, the firewall is not an issue on this server. I've checked the settings and, as stated previously, my other tool gets SQL Browser Service responses to a broadcast just fine. Also, running WHERE reports that the path to SQLCMD is , which is correct per File Locations for Default and Named Instances of SQL Server. Does anyone have any idea why SQLCMD is doing this and how to fix it? 

Repairing and/or Re-installing Microsoft Connection Manager for Oracle by Attunity, VS 2012, and SSDT 2012 followed by a reboot enabled me to finally see the and SSIS components in the window under the category. While using component still causes the same error, dragging over an component succeeds. Configuring the component to set the Connection Manager, Data Access mode ("Table" in my case) and "Name of the Table" work great now. Clicking on the button proved it's working by showing me actual data from my Oracle Source database. 

Note: "TERM" is the name of the Data Flow task (named after the table I want to copy with SSIS. This clearly looks like registry damage to me, so I had uninstalled the Attunity copmnent and re-installed it; and I ran a repair on Visual Studio 2012 (in that order); rebooted, etc. No luck so far. Anyone ever seen this before and/or have any ideas how to get back to a working SSIS development? I am working on a development box, my Oracle Connection tests fine, and I can also connect fine to my SQL Server 2012 instance as well. 

I am creating my first SSIS package to support the E of our ETL from an external Oracle database to our internal SQL Server 2012 databse. Using Visual Studio 2012 and I have installed the Microsoft Oracle Connection Manager by Attunity 2.0 I had this working, then renamed and deleted some files, and tried to build it again when I ran into this problem. When running Source Assistant, I receive the Visual Studio Error: 

While reviewing my Oracle source database, I am now noticing that the fields that have been imported as DT_WSTR are in fact declared using the PL/SQL syntax - where the the second "CHAR" is explicitly stating the character semantics - rather than the default byte semantics. Thus, in my Oracle database, I believe I need to treat a column with database data type as a character datatype using character semantics, and I believe that means that the field can accommodate 1 character regardless of the byte length of the character set in use. Given the above, SSIS (via the Microsoft Oracle Connector by Attunity) will promote non-NCHAR/NVARCHAR data types to DT_WSTR (as opposed to DT_STR). And, following the above, I will need NCHAR and NVARCHAR SQL Server database data types when importing columns expressed using character semantics. Once I do this, I will no longer have to convert DT_WSTR data types to DT_STR in my SSIS data flows (which was becoming quite tedious). Note, I was already using NCHAR and NVARCHAR for fields declared as such on the Oracle side - expecting to provide the proper storage for these types on the SQL Server side. UPDATE: Here is the docs.oracle.com web page that shows the syntax I describe as follows: 

If the SQL Browser Service is active, you can query the service for SQL Instances with the PowerShell code below. It implements the following commandlets to perform the queries: 

Although you can get SQL Management Studio to connect with Read Only Intent, it does not store the Additional Connection Parameters when a connection is added to Registered Servers. Behavior when hand editing the locally registered servers in the RegSrvr.xml file to add the Application Intent is extremely inconsistent and will be overwritten any time a change is made through the GUI making this workaround unreliable. The Always On database must be selected before the query window is opened; otherwise, the connection gets routed to the primary server. If you attempt to select the database using the query window's drop down after the query window has already been opened to a non-Always On database, you will get an error dialog. If you try to change the database to an Always On database with a USE statement after the query window has already been opened to a non-Always On database, the results look like this when you attempt to execute the SQL query: 

Click Options >>. Go to the Additional Connection Parameters tab. Enter the additional parameter as ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly; (Note: Users must not click the Options << button after entering the Additional Connection Parameters or the parameters will be lost.) Click Connect. Always launch query windows by right-clicking on the desired database in the Object Explorer view and choosing New Query to avoid running into the #3 caveat below. 

As long as they are not nested, you should be fine. @@FETCH_STATUS is set at the time the FETCH NEXT is performed. @@FETCH_STATUS is global to the session, not the entire server. There is no equivalent to SCOPE_IDENTITY() for @@FETCH_STATUS. If you need to nest looped FETCH NEXT operations, make sure that your outer FETCH NEXT is performed after the inner loop completes. If you need to stack FETCH NEXT operations or perform a FETCH NEXT before an inner loop containing a FETCH NEXT, you can DECLARE a temporary variable of type outside the loop, SET the temporary variable equal to @@FETCH_STATUS immediately after your FETCH NEXT statement, and then use the temporary variable as your loop control instead of @@FETCH_STATUS. 

I have a server with three installed SQL Server 2014 instances with Service Pack 1 (build number is 12.0.4213.0) installed. When I run SQLCMD -L on the server I am getting the bizarre response below.
