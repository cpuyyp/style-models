That is ok, because RPi supports only the 2.4 GHz band and not the 5 GHz. Follow one of these guides to setting up wireless networking using your 2.4 wifi and it should work. 

This is the reason why you can connect to raspberry1 on port 3306, but not to raspberry2 on the same port. To make your raspberry2 accessible just set the correct bind_address in mycnf. Security advice: If your RPis are not behind a well managed firewall, please read why it is a bad idea to allow direct connections to your databases and how you can configure MariaDB in a safe way for remote client access. 

Another solution (you have asked in a comment for a "'production' solution") could be to restrict physical access by encapsulating the Raspberry Pi into a lockable case (container like a server rack or IT cabinet). This way you do not need to partial damage the device with glue or something like that. There are small cabinets available with a glass door. This could be really usefull if you need the status of the LEDs: in case you need this information simply ask your friend to look for the LEDs and report back. Just a few different examples, not a recommendation: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Or you could build your own case like you need it. Options are endless. 

The name of the workgroup can be anything you want, as long as it only contains alphabetical characters, and it matches the name of the workgroup that you want to join. You also need to add the following section of code to : 

Use SDFormatter, it is official from the SD Card enterprise, it is avaliabe for Mac and Win, i had the same problem and it worked for me. An other way to do it in Mac is using (Disk utility on Mac page), it is already installed, go to , it normally works. Don't forget to select or 

Scroll down until you see a section called Share Definitions, and add this code there. The path should point to the drive or folder that you want to share. I've set and to so that Samba prompts for a password when I visit the folder that I've shared. This means that when I'm using a Windows PC, I can login to the shared folders on my Pi, and I'll have the same read/write permissions that user pi has. Now type this command in a terminal, and enter pi's password twice: 

You can reduce the sensitivity of the PIR sensor by turning the little yellow trimpot ("Phillips screw") anti-clockwise. On your photo it is the top one. This adafruit overview could be helpful. Make sure that no unwanted infrared transmitter triggers the PIR sensor, like LEDs or (television) remote control unit. Regarding your python script: I would add in a new line after . And to stop the running script from command line by pressing : 

Make your script executable: 2.) Create the html file with or , i.e. (optional, you could request the following php file straight): 

If you have installed Munin through the distribution packages (my recommendation), the webserver will be configured automatically and available at (replace "ip"). You can configure it like any other virtual host, i.e. you can make it accessible per SSL/TLS only, protect it with credentials etc., see Authentication and Authorization - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4. Munin works great with Apache. lighttpd and nginx are supported as well. Webserver Configuration - Munin Guide Alerts If you have an MTA already up and running (like Exim), you can tell Munin to alert you via email: 

the problem is: your HDD has a specific formatation , and the formatation is not compatible with the both Raspberry Pi. Try to format it as or , it normally works. Whatever, where do you formatted the HDD? If you formatted it in a Raspberry Pi, try to format it in a Computer. I have a 1TB HDD, i formatted it as in Mac, using Disk Utility and it works in any device, including in my Raspberry Pi 3. 

First: I don't know how much power has the Amazon Alexa Charger, but anyway check if the charger has 5 Volts and MINIMALLY 2.0 Ampers, Second: I can't acess the website, but confirm if the Raspberry Pi versions are the same (or compatible) Third: Are you using a external screen? If you are using the mini touchscreen it normally doesn't show image, because your has to be configured to a specific number, to change the Pixels number, and others. Fourth: Try to boot the Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS, instaled by NOOBS. If it don't works with Raspbian OS, you have a problem with your Raspberry Pi, check if the led turns ON and check if the blinks at least 5 times. Tell me something about this tips, and after thet i will give you some specific indications. 

On Raspbian you have two common options: Option 1: Add the already created user (i.e. with the name "john") to the group "sudo": 

I do not recommended to upgrade Raspbian from Wheezy (Debian 7) to Raspbian Stretch (Debian 9) and skip Raspbian Jessie (Debian 8). Fyi: table of Debian releases Option 1: upgrade from 7 to 8 to 9 Backup first. Then upgrade from Wheezy to Jessie (i.e. like described here) and afterwards from Jessie to Stretch. Option 2: abandon 7, skip 8, install 9 Backup your old Wheezy and all needed data, format the SD card and install Stretch (like described here). This way you will get a stable OS. Weighing up Both options can result in comparable effort, but it is difficult to say from here. If there are only a few projects running on Wheezy and it is simple to redo all needed changes after a new installation, I would vote for option 2. And based on my experiences I do not think that an upgrade from 7 to 8 to 9 will finish without errors. Maybe you have a second SD card and want to try both options. And like always: please do a backup first :-) 

As suggested here, go to Build â†’ Set Build Commands and change references to to in the Compile and Execute sections. After that, Tk will work as expected: 

Get a Miniature WiFi (802.11b/g/n) Module. Many places sell these, and they are cheap. There are many lookalikes, but it must have a Realtek RTL8188CUS chipset in it. Plug your Raspberry Pi into a monitor, and power it up with the wifi module installed. This may require a USB hub. Use the WiFi Config tool on the desktop. 

There are no complaints in my dmesg log. The card is a relatively cheap Transcend Class10 32GB. I think you may have a faulty card. If you can bear to, run it through the official SD Association SD Formatter and give it a low-level format. Making full-media images of your card may not be the best way of backing up your stuff. I usually just use rsync to save off , tar to get a few choice files in , and if I can remember how, I dump a list of the installed Debian packages. Everything else can be set up pretty quickly from the command line. gsh's answer from the forum that you repeatedly refer to is from a couple of months ago. Any issue that there was has been fixed, and the firmware update doesn't write to the card in any special way that would cause problems. 

An official "Troubleshooting Tutorial" is available. Raspberry Pi specific By default the Master collects the data every 5 minutes. If your Master is under heavy workload, adjust the interval. I recommend to use a fast SD card on the Master. For each Node this process takes around 10-15 seconds (on our setup, wifi only). 

To redirect the requests to your Apache 2.4 name-based virtual host from HTTP to HTTPS you have many options. This one should help you: is the default configuration file for HTTP (port 80): 

source: Server System Variables - MariaDB Knowledge Base shows in the column "Local Address" for your raspberry1 "0.0.0.0:3306" (all IPv4s are allowed to access this device on port 3306) and for your raspberry2 "127.0.0.1:3306" (only localhost is allowed): 

If mod_rewrite is missing, run . Then run and your site should work. If you test your site, disable HTTP cache in your browser! 

the problem can be: The Sharing Proprierities in your RPi, you are visible but the contents are blocked; IP Configuration, the both devices have to be connected by the same way, normally by LAN, because the WiFi's and LAN's IPs aren't the same; SOLUTION You can share your Raspberry Pi's files and folders across a network using a piece of software called Samba, a Linux implementation of the Server Message Block protocol. You'll need to install this software: 

If you have a PC or laptop connected to your workgroup, you should be able to see your Raspberry Pi in Windows Explorer under Network. I Hope This Help ;) IanPP 

After one of this processes, run or go to the , then, search , add it to the Trust List, insert the password (normally or ) and connect it clicking . If the problem persists, the problem is of the module, try to connect it to a Android, if it don't connects, you will need to buy a new one. 

To reduce logfile write operations on the RPi you could set up a centralized log server with rsyslog. If you want to keep the entries, just send the messages to the remote log server, else to /dev/null. 

Then run a configuration file syntax test: (for more details: ). If no error occurs, enable both configurations for your vhost: 

After editing restart the node: Plugins On a Node you can run to get a list of the available, used and unused plugins (please be patient, on a Raspberry Pi 3 this command takes a few minutes to finish). Plugins can vary from simple to complex, please consult the plugin documentation. If you want to edit a plugin, I'd recommend to read "How to write Munin plugins". To debug a plugin you can run (replace "[pluginName]"). To deactivate a plugin run (replace "[pluginName]"). This will not delete the plugin file, just the symbolic link. Then run and Munin will no longer use this plugin. Troubleshooting and Logfiles Make sure that no firewall is blocking the communication. To debug check the logfiles on the respective devices:
