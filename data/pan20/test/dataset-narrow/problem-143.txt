The routing task (receive packets and forward them) is a layer 3 task. A router in its basic features is a layer 3 device because it only checks the content at layer 3 (). It doesn't mean that the device is unable to use or check upper layer protocols. For example in a router you can put a filter of TCP ports to block the access to HTTP, FTP, etc. The router can use a higher layer protocol to send / receive information to/from other routers (RIP, OSPF, etc.) In addition a router is a host. it can be reached via SSH / telnet or upgraded via FTP /SFTP. 

An ethernet hub is nothing but a single cable inside a box with multiple RJ-45 connectors just like this: 

So and learn the MAC address of the brown interface of the router. They are unaware of the original MAC adddress, and they don't need to know it. When needs to reply to it simply sends the packet to IP address and MAC. 

Attenuation is dependent of frequency. For example, the following is the Attenuation vs. Frequency for an RG-8 (coaxial) cable: 

Each byte goes from (in hex) to or in binary to . 6 bytes * 8 bits per byte = 48 bits total combinations of 48 bits = 2^48 = 281474976710656 MAC addresses can be re-used. Manufacturers usually send cards with duplicate addresses to different parts of the world, so there's no chance of two network cards with the same MAC address on the same network. The MAC addresses must be unique on a local network, but there's not a problem for having duplicate MAC addresses if they are separated by one or more routers since the devices won't see each other directly. 

Link layer Error Detection: A method to verify the integrity of frames when they are transmited over the media. The receiving side can verify if the received frame has been damaged on transit. If link layer detects a damaged frame, then it discards the frame and could or not ask for a retransmission. (Ethernet never asks for retransmission, it simply discards). Transport layer Error Control: The sending side send segments that are divided on multiple packets at network layer and each packet on multiple frames at link level. Each segment travels the network (divided as frames and packets) and is recomposed only at the receiving side. Between the sending and receiving side could be a lot of intermediate routers. During that transit there could be problems as: 

/28 means that you are assigning the last 4 bits to the host part of the address. 176 in binary is . The last 4 bits are zero, it means that it is the network address of the subnet. You can't assign to a device the first address (network address) or the last address (broadcast address) of a subnet. 

The borrowed bits are the host bits in the default subnet mask that are used for network in the custom subnet mask. In your example: Last byte of the default subnet mask: 

Your WAN IP address is being port-scanned systematically looking for a vulnerability. The router should block all this incoming traffic from reaching your LAN, however it imposes a high toll in router's performance because its processor does not have enough capacity to process and dump the packets fast enough. There is nothing you can do to stop the attacks from hitting your router, except reboot the router in hope that the ISP assigns your connection another IP address. 

A block contains 512 addresses. 2^(32-23)=512 You can use them to make any number of subnets that you want. For example: 

In the switch create 3 VLANs: The first one, let's call it VLAN A for all the devices in range . The second one VLAN B for the devices in . And a third one for example VLAN C for the router. Keep in mind that you must change the IP address of the router to make it belong to another subnet: for example. It means also that the router will be unable to act as DHCP server and the devices on the other two VLANs must get their IP addresses from other DHCP server on their respective VLANs or be configured manually. 

128 customers, each with 128 addresses. 128=2^7. To allocate 128 addresses you will need 7 bits. From the full 32 bits of the IPv4 adddress, 7 bits will go to host and the remaining 25 will be network. Then each of the 128 networks should use /25. As the last address of the first group is then we have to start from : 

As I know the main problem of transporting power over ethernet cables is temperature rise and resistance. 802.3af defines the max power as 12.95 W and max current as 350 mA over 2 pairs. 802.3at defines the max power as 25 W and max current as 600 mA over 2 pairs. For both of them the typical wire (24 AWG) supports the temperature rise. Lower diameters as 26 AWG and 28 AWG increases the resistance, so they are not recommended beside that the temperature rise increases also. 802.3bt will define the max power as 96 W and max current as 1000 mA over 4 pairs. For the moment there are not official documents stating the max temperature rise allowed. Check this document that goes deeper than my explanation. 

A LAN is a group of devices connected to the same network that can commuicate among them. A virtual LAN is a group of devices that using a predefined in the ethernet frames can communicate among them. They are isolated of other devices in the same network that don't use the same tag. 

The first statement is correct. Every device in a network needs to know the IP address in order to be able to send packets to another network. The second one isn't true, because when the device in network B inspects the IP layer, it finds that the belongs to network A. So it will try to send the reply through its own and if it doesn't know the default gateway IP, it will discard the packet. 

Forget about classes. They were overruled by CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) in 1993. The router vendors usually put the address of the device in the range 192.168.X.X It is configured in that way because there are three ranges defined in RFC 1918 for private use: 

The size of the buffer determines the amount of queuing available on the port without dropping packets and causing performance degradation. 

A default gateway is a device connected to the LAN. When a device (PC, Tablet,etc.) needs to connect to an address outside the LAN, then sends the packets to the Default Gateway. The Default Gateway is connected to other networks, so it is able to forward the packets outside. In your case as a Default Gateway is a proxy server that "maybe" is filtering protocols (bittorrent, streaming) or destinations (adult content, gambling,etc.) before sending the packets to the real Default Gateway. 

The IPv6 header format was designed to keep the header overhead to a minimum. The non-essential fields and optional fields were moved to extension headers that are placed after the IPv6 header. The IPv6 header can be processed more efficiently at intermediate routers. 

A PC in a private IP range can't be acccesed from the public internet. Devices in private range connecting to internet use a proxy or router/NAT device that replaces the local source IP for a single public IP address that redides in your router/NAT. However, you can make an exception to that, opening a port in the router and allowing that traffic directed to your public IP adddress and that specific port (for example, ) get through the router and finally to your PC. Now your PC is public at least on port . Internet knows how to get to your PC using the public address and the router translate that public Ip to the private that your device uses. An example: Your PC has the private IP address and is connected to an internet router that has the public IP . Now, if you open the port in the router then anyone in the public internet could connect to your PC using the URL $URL$ The public internet doesn't know your private IP, they know your public IP address. 

I think it's better understood using an example: Internet Layer manages the addressing. And addressing means to know its own address and the subnet where the system belongs. To be aware of that information it is neccesary to know the subnet mask. On the internet protocol they go together, because it let the system decides easily if a packet goes to its own subnet or to another one through the default gateway. Trying to separate it in two different layers is possible but not useful. 

Excess Defer frames: According to Cisco documentation it is the number of frames that are not sent after the time exceeds the maximum-packet time. It means that the port is under heavy load. The device connected to the port is transmitting or receiving more traffic that can be handled by the port. Verify if the port is configured as half-duplex or full-duplex.
