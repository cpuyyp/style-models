This question is unclear. What exactly do you want to know? I also started with zero knowledge of RPi 9 months ago so I understand being overwhelmed. However you are not giving enough information and asking to many vague questions to get any good answer. You need to tell us things such as what RPi you have and what operating system you have. I assume your not using the command line but a GUI. But assumptions help no one. These are just examples only the tip of the iceberg. If you do not have a basic understanding of the device you are using how can you expect to control it? I strongly suggest going to $URL$ click on help and then click on the documentation box. Start from the setup/quickstart tab and read every section of every tab finishing with hardware. Then visit the learning resource center. You mentioned something about drum beats or something and gpio pins and a breadboard. Making a beat has nothing to do with the pins. If you have an SD card with NOOBS then you have Sonic pi a program for making music. That is just one option, there are many more. I am still very new but confident in what I know and I know more everyday. I decided to learn from the command line. I knew that I was getting a raspberry pi to learn Linux, Bash, python and php. I had no project in mind only learning the tool. At first I read and practiced the basics of getting around the system, knowing how to operate it and what is on it. Also learned about copying, making and moving files. I learned my network and things like SSH login. I set up a web server, copied and backed up my system. I learned what packages were installed and how to install then remove other packages. Do you know how to get packages or use github? You are confused because you are jumping steps. You can't get answers to your question because you are not asking answerable questions. I speak from experience. learn the basics first. Ask questions as you encounter them. Dont dismiss sections because you feel that it wont apply to what you want to do, because it just might...you dont know what you need to know. 

I don't know if the subtitles are multiplexed on-the-go to the video file (in which case, subtitles can be shown/hidden), or if the video is transcoded on-the-go with the subtitles (in which case subtitles cannot be hidden as it is part of the image). In the second case, I doubt the RPi could handle such a load... 

You can share a USB device over the network by installing on your RPi. I found a quick tutorial on the official Raspberry Pi forum (all credits to secretagent, the OP). I haven't tested the solution by myself. On the Raspberry Pi (server) 

You will probably have to adapt to your needs to avoid to to take hundreds of megabytes. Then, you will need to parse with a script to extract the information you want. 

As short answer, what I can say from my experience is, as long as you do not use (free implementation of SMB/CIFS) or NTFS for the NAS part, that should be fine. Those two features are known to be CPU intensive and could be a bottleneck for the RPi. XBMC can run quite smoothly on a Pi. (the daemon client for the popular BitTorrent Transmission) has low CPU/RAM footprint as well. 

If you see a similar message, then the port forwarding configuration works well. Otherwise, you should tweak your router... SSH server configuration If none solution of the above worked, the problem is probably in the SSH server or RPi configuration. 

I tried to play a movie with embedded subtitles with my PS3 from my Synology NAS, and I cannot display them. I cannot change the audio track either (for languages). My LG TV is able to read all of them, and I can hide or show the subtitles. So I guess the DLNA protocol can handle videos with embedded subtitles. PS3 is just not as good as you expect about playing video files. You should really consider playing videos with embedded subtitles first. If it works with your player, leave a comment, and then we will work from that. 

I figured out the problem was due to a bad power supply. I turned it on with nothing pluged in and it worked. I swithched to a better power supply and now it works even with the dongle pluged in on start up. 

Is it possible for Raspberry pi to flash Noobs to any Android device? I have no device I am actively trying this on yet. If it is possible I a Nexus device running Android is what I would try to work with. I want more control over my Android. 

I would start over. If you have started making or building files and directories and moving things or deleting things you are going to spend a lot of time trying to fix things that never should have been messed with. Burn Raspbian or NOOBS from Raspberrypi.org according to the instructions given on the downloads page. After you reinstall do not make,remove, or delete files and folders before you check simple things like spelling, punctuation and spacing as you type them in the terminal. Make sure you use sudo or have permission to do what are trying to do. You stated you did not think you had a boot folder, and also you made a boot folder to create a config.txt file. I will tell you this..you may have deleted, moved or renamed it but at one time you did. I personally do NOT mess around with folders like boot without caution and backing up my system. I would suggest you spend some time learning the file tree, how it works and what the files and folders are used for. Raspberry pi is very forgiving. You can mess up and just burn a new image to reinstall and keep going a million times. By taking time to learn about your system and how it works you wont need to reinstall a million times. This is not the answer you are looking for, but they way you asked the question and what you are asking for I believe this is the answer you need. There may be a series of commands that could potentially save the day and undo what has been done, but if you are just planning on typing in commands that you never understand you will always have problems. If you always have problems you are not having fun, and if you are not having fun what is the point. Trust me I was given the advice I am giving you. I was offended at first but I gave it a try and it is fun it takes effort but it is worth it. 

This feature is called CEC. It allows a device to be controlled with a remote from a TV through the HDMI cable. You can even switch on/off automatically a device when you switch on/off your TV. It works out of the box with many devices such as PlayStation 3, A/V receivers, and Raspberry Pi as well (from my exprience, only with the OpenELEC distribution, but now, maybe with others). CEC has commercial names depending on manufacturers such as Anynet+ for Samsung, or SimpLink for LG. 

The Raspberry Pi (even the B+ model) cannot be switched on/off easily. The easy way is to plug/unplug the RPi, as you already do. To switch it on/off with a remote, you will have to plug some third-party component in the GPIO. You can either make it yourself if you are into electronics, or buy one of those RemotePi Board (I just found it, maybe other similar products exist). The other way is to power the RPi with the USB port of your TV. When you switch it off, the RPi won't be powered anymore. But, by switching the Pi off brutally, it could corrupt your data... 

If you manage to install one of them, please share your experience by asking and answering a new question. 

GMediaRender should do the trick. It is a UPNP media renderer running as a daemon. I've once succeeded in installing and running this soft on my RPi. A couple of tutorials explain how to install it on a Pi. It is quite tricky, but possible. I think I have followed the first link. If you are brave enough, I suggest you to share your experience by answering your own question and explain step-by-step the procedure to install GMediaRender. 

I am running Raspbian jessie 8 on my RPi3. I am trying to see what version of samba is installed if any. I do not remember installing it as far as i know it is for remote access but I am not totally sure. It seems like when I update I see it updating but again i am not 100% sure. Can some one give me a hint on the command. I have already tried uname -a, smbd -v, and smbdstatus. 

If I use a password manager to store all passwords including my password for the pi itself. Does any type of text file or folder get created and stored anywhere on the raspberrypi..or only on the usb drive? 

I want to get my 13 year old coding. I have a RPi3 I downloaded Retro pi so he could check it out. He went online and found all the cases that are out there for it. He wants one so he can build the retro pi game system. He will get board with the game system soon enough. My question is if we use the zero for Retro-pi and want to later add raspbian will we have enough RAM to do both or should I buy a different model to begin with? 

I have a Netgear router that is compatible to flash DD-WRT. I have read you can use mac windows or linux. I only have a RPi3 no other computers. Will my Rpi3 work for this? I am running the latest Rasbian and have a 16G sd card. 

I would check the voltage one the tutorial link posted. It is for a 12v strip. Yours says 24v? Raspberry pi 5v. Seems a bit inefficient to me. 

Multi user chat (aka MUC) MUC are clients allowing you to join different rooms and chat with people you don't necessary know. A well known MUC client is IRC (not XMPP). Some web-based examples: 

I don't know if you are looking for a surveillance software, but I have succeeded in installing and running , a software motion detector. You should have a look in the official guide. 

We will make sure the SSH server listens for every hosts. Run . You see the part of the following line? It says "I [the SSH server] will listen the port 22 but only for the hosts matching " ( means "every hosts"). If you don't see it, the problem is SSH server configuration (see next section): 

Obviously, the problem seems to be either the port forwarding configuration, or the ability for the SSH server/RPi to handle external connections. Port forwarding configuration Maybe you should try with a specific external port. Let's say 10022 (external port) forward to your RPi IP address, port 22. Then from an external IP address, try . If you have a message similar to this: 

As far as I know, there is no software that allows to block the network access for background processes. You can use AppArmor to block the Internet access for every software. You should be able to put every programs in a blacklist, and then put in the whitelist. But it will surely be painful! For the blacklist, you can use rules similar to this (you'll have to find every paths!): 

I don't know the compatibility version chart between OpenSSH servers and clients, but I think that updating your OpenSSH client (from your desktop, laptop, or whatever) should resolve your problem. 

When I power up Pi Zero, I get to the page to boot into safe mode and the screen goes black for a few seconds and then flashes and shows four colored squares in the top right corner of my screen. If I try and press shift to boot into recovery it does the same thing. I have not seen this issue before is it my SD card or possibly a power problem 

If I create a partion on my 32gig USB stick using rpi2 then format it to FAT32 allow me to then copy the SD card of the Rpi2 onto the USB stick? 

I bought my son a pi zero w. Originally we he wanted Retropi. Now he wants to stream Steam instead. I found information that said adding a graphics card to RPI 3 it is possible to stream some games. I have found no information referencing the pi zero at all. Does this mean it is not possible? 

I saw a variety of answers. some I knew and some i did not know. There is also one I always use that has not been listed yet. If it has and I missed it oops sorry. sudo hostname -I 

Dude It is very well documented no motors for the pi. Get arduino, sparkfun, or adafruit micro controller for this stuff. Pi and Arduino work well together and both offer features the other lacks. Just as a reference check out the Arduino web IDE. Open file-examples and see all the possibilities instantly. RPi can not compare in this way 

I agree with MartinMarty in my experience using apache..the original file by default was /var/www/html. After downloading PHP I had to change the HTML to PHP. I did this by typing Sudo nano /var/www/php5 I then added some simple PHP code to show the date saved the file usomg control x Y Enter Then from the terminal I had to remove /var/www/HTMl I then type ls to verify it is gone revisit the ip address hit refresh and you should see the date and the file will be php I hope this helps..it worked for me 

I measured the power consumption of my WRT610N router with a Belkin Conserve Insight power monitor. The WRT610N has two antennas (2.4GHz and 5GHz), and I disabled one of them. To load the system, I used . 

Remember to change the variable (don't make it root!) Change the permissions so that the file can be executed: 

I haven't tried the following solution, but if you have a compatible Linksys router (or maybe other manufacturers), you can enable the logging feature (as codewarrior already suggested. Thanks to him). Then, you need to specify the IP address where you want the logs to be stored (your RPi's). On your RPi, install one of the implementation of . or for instance: 

Please copy/paste the result of in the comment section. & You can also have a look in the following files & . Please copy/paste the result of & in the comment section. 

I like to use to make sure my device is reachable from my external network. This software allows you to test the bandwidth performances and, maybe it is not the fastest way, but it is lightweight and easy to use :-) Install it from your RPi (), then run . The default listening port is 5001. So you will have to define another port forwarding (external port 5001 -> , port 5001). From an external IP address, run . 

For security reasons, it is normal the password is hidden. Please make sure you have a qwerty keyboard layout. In France, we have an azerty keyboard layout. So, to enter the password , we have to type . To make sure you have the good keyboard layout, try to type the password in the user field without validating it. Once you are logged in, you can change the keyboard layout by running and following the prompts. These instructions are for a Raspbian distro.
