There are several things that can be done, however as @Dawny33 mentioned, start with the problem you want solved. As an example, If I was trying to solve: Which factors, influence the prices and how? A simple analysis could be to run a linear regression model () with as a dependent variable and others as regressors. You can then select top 10 or 15 or how so ever many you like and look at their relationship. This may help you answer some simple questions like: 

Values of A that exist in the other vector, or Values of B that exist in the other vector, or Unique values that exist in either vectors. 

B. On doing so, is it correct that it is the right thing to do to cite the paper (lets say I am required to hand over competition code). Now lets say the author published some code to go along with the paper under an MIT/other open source license on github, and I mess around with it to fit my needs. What if the paper was by a company (like facebook or google, but does not cite any patent or limitation on use of the code/method) Do the same rules apply or are there other considerations? I guess I have not found a good blog covering this and any surrounding issues I may not be aware of as self-taught professional human running into this for the first time. 

The third is tricky because you do not have vectors of equal lengths. Hence there is no index that could be mapped. So the option in that case should be the intersection of the unique values from each vector as @michaelg mentioned. Here are a few ways depending on what you want to do: 

I am trying to add multiple new rows for 3 new factor level in an existing data frame. Please refer to sample data for an example. My starting data frame has 18 levels for and all 12 months for column and past 20 years for . I then impute values and add new columns, however I need new factors to be added for further analysis. For each and combination, a new level should exist. Sample df: 

Learning rate is too high. Try starting with lower LR (like 10e-5). Sometimes this works with Adam. Weight Initialization : double check you are using Xavier. 

Going off the discussion in the @Andres Espinosa's answer, here is an option that might work for this without any extra gating voodoo. The Nested LSTMs paper, Implementation here. The nested LSTM idea is to build in the idea of a temporal abstraction hierarchy - which in your case could possible capture the current pattern at the first level, and the need to switch between patterns at a deeper level. In addition there is the untouched idea about why your LSTM is not working in the first place. Before doing extra work, maybe it is worth trying visualizing the LSTM activations. In theory, if the LSTM has learned different phases in your input, there would be a different distribution of activations depending on the 'phase' or more significant changes in the hidden state between phases vs within the phase, since it would pay attention to different things depending on the phase, it could be a matter of just more training time. If it is consistently not picking up something that can be visually diagnosed, then it would suggest trying one of the other ideas. 

Sub bullet is important here because unless reads the entire dataset, it cannot determine the datatype. Providing this information alone at the time of the read makes processing much faster. By reading a subset of the data, R makes it easier to interpret the datatype and then assigns it to the subsequent sets without worrying about what the actual datatype is. Does R really loads all the data every time? Functions that allow filter at the time of read, really target the third step of reading data sequentially. Each row is compared against the filter criteria and the result stored as a binary logical index. This index is then used to determine, what remains when the connection closes. I could not find specific reference in the documentation if the discard happens immediately or post entire read, but I will assume that the collects the garbage automatically as it reads with a filter criteria and makes the memory available to a subsequent line of data. May be there are other experts who can throw more light on the real inner workings here and either validate or correct my assumptions, but hope my context helps. 

If the reference to 7 chunks of information for humans is a reference to the 'Magical Number Seven' Paper, which is the human working memory, then: Consider the high level operation of DNC at a timestep. An input comes in, and is processed by an LSTM to generate a 'Interface vector' which interacts with memory with Write, Erase and Read operations. The operations are then executed, and a final layer produces an output based on the retrieved information and the input. Where is the analogy to human 'working memory'? 1). If you consider the working memory is what is retrieved on read, then there is a hyperparameter for number of memory reads. This applies generally to Write and Erase as well as those are all hyperparameters which determine the size of the Interface Vector. In the paper they used a write size of 1 in all cases for purposes of controlling the experiments. Note that the 'size' of what is read/written in a single operation is a separate parameter, which just depends on how the problem is encoded (see the methods section of the paper). 2). If you consider working memory as external memory, then this is another hyperparameter. I think it is a conceptual mistake to view the external memory as short term memory, as the addition of this and all the gating was specifically developed to store information long term and then recall when needed. 3). There is a part of the DNC's operation which queries a link matrix (storing what was written to long term memory and when) during the read phase. This can be seen as being related to human working memory, as numerous behavioral economics studies showed that what we recall and how we process it is effected by what we have just seen. This is the only part in the paper where the computation is O(N^2) w.r.t to the size of the memory, (though they approximate with an O(NlogN) method). This portion of retrieval/bias of what is retrieved to most recently accessed information can then be said to have a limit, since for large memories it will not scale with rest of network, but this is still not constant. 4). Probably the best candidate for the working memory analogy IMO is the hidden state of the controller LSTM, since this part of the algorithm is responsible for storing what is needed over time for retrieval, and on its own is used for storing a state over time. The reason that this is short term memory in this analogy is just that the external memory is an explicit external memory, and this is the only other place where a state is maintained. So in short no, there is no Constant, as just about every conceivable analogy to 'working memory' and the entire architecture is controlled by parameters. It is worth checking out the code and paper for more details on exactly how the parameters are set for different experiments. Let me know if this makes sense. 

Establish a connection with the file. Open the file Read the data sequentially Load the data in memory Close the connection dump the object into a variable if assigned, else render the output in some gui. 

If ambiguous and open ended problem statements excite you, you should. If you love and continue to apply mathematical concepts beyond your college degree, you should. If you always question why before what and how, you should. Given your question however, I am tempted to say No, but it is solely up to you. What would you like and more importantly why would you like it? 

Never used this, but $URL$ has something close... pretrained models on jewelry. You can probably extend those models. The new google dataset may also have labeled versions of the stuff you need. I cannot find the link I saw origionally, but it has bounding boxes for 20K classes down to 'teacup' 'teacup handle', 'tea', so I would not write google off before testing either. Since this is DataScience SE, I will give the more DS answer as well. The thing you are looking for sounds like a multi-category classifier. You can probably find good resources and pretrained models here, and on the end, sklearn has apis for common classifiers. The general idea is run your image through a Convnet, minus the classification part. You then have 1K-8K 'features' which a second algorithm set of classifiers, [decision forest]($URL$ ), logical compisitional model, embedding, etc... gives a score for each binary attribute. 

I think @biswajit-banerjee comments (and others) should be helpful. When you say, , i assume you are looking at either 

There are multiple aspects to performance when it comes to reading a portion of the file. I am going to discuss the two most common one based on functions that are available in the base R. What is R doing at the time of reading? 

No. Can you build solutions that can be data products and feed some reporting and analytics using .Net? Yes. Being a DS myself, I work with folks who do exactly that. Are they part of my Job Family? No. In spite of its similarities in some areas, Data Science (and analysis) in general requires a different skill set than a pure developer. It among other things can also require lot of data exploration, wrangling, plotting and research on a day to day basis. Unless you are really ready to change your job profile at your career stage, and bear the ever changing and dynamic nature of DS, stay put and invest time in technologies that have synergies with your existing skill set. +1 for Angular as I know how heavily my employer is investing in it. 

Keras metrics.binary_crossentropy computes the cross entropy averaged across all inputs (pseudocode): 

While an RNN using one-hot encoded moves is possible, I would suggest that your model needs to understand chess (or similar complex games) at a deeper level to be able to associate comments to positions. I would encode the position itself (eg a layered representation like in Alpha-Zero paper), and pass those through a conv-RNN to model the temporal relationship between positions corresponding to annotations. (Maybe you can find a pretrained model for evaluation as a baseline). I read a fair amount of chess commentary, and one thing that is common is that there are cases of single move as well as comments about several moves at a time (think opening lines, or forced continuations), which are fairly discrete (my 'move 10 sacrifice' and my 'move 15 blunder' are not related by a hidden state). This leads me to think that instead of an RNN model, you are really trying to first Partition then Embed moves in a comment space - which then leads to a model that is first an RNN which may learn likely partitions of moves to be commented on, then another model, perhaps conditional autoencoder, is trained jointly on (position | comment) subsequences (you should still have plenty of features to work with at this point, so no worry about a weak signal). The 'search' functionality here points not at a pure deep learning model, since you want to find specific instances of positions, rather than a typical position with that comment (ie sampling a latent space). This leads me to think that you create an explicit data-structure to map points in your final embedding space to their positions. So if you wanted to search 'Nice Sacrifice', model would find closest points in 'comment space' and return those games using something like cosine distance, or this last step is clustering of the (position | comment) space. Either way, interesting problem, try the simpler thing first. 

Shiny App, will be the place to display the graphics, however the animation you are looking for is not something that would create, to the best of my knowledge. however is a different beast. It can create aesthetically pleasing graphics. For your specific case, here is the example $URL$ Or you can look at the entire gallery 

The image has a sample column, however the data is not consistent. There are also some floats and NAN. I need these to be split across columns. That is each unique value becomes a column in the df. Any insights?
