The PSU with the highest voltage will supply the Raspberry Pi with the power. There is a risk with back power, if the voltage on PSU 1 is higher than PSU 2 there will be a current flowing from PSU 1 to PSU 2, this is the reason for the diodes, they will protect the PSU's from the back current. Please remember that the diodes have a voltage drop that will impact in a decreased voltage level on the output to the Raspberry Pi. 

It is possible to redirect a remote computer that can act as a STDIN (keyboard) over the network. Example uinput-mapper. $URL$ 

LEDs need a current limiting resistor. here is a answer how to calculate the resistor How to get started with basic Raspberry Pi electronics? Buttons. Look here $URL$ Buzzer, the GPIO can deliver 3,3volt, 16mA and the buzzer is a 6volt, 45mA device. Both the voltage and the current is to high for a GPIO. So you need a external power and a driver circuit, a transistor and a resistor. Replace Arduino with Raspberry Pi in the picture. 

The current 3mA is well below the max current of 16mA that is the limit for a Raspberry Pi GPIO and the voltage of 3v as well. 

iBeacon is like a lighthouse that send out beacons that an application can pick up and process. Here is a pretty good "Getting Started with iBeacon". $URL$ 

Raspberry Pi 1 uses standard SD card, but you can get a SD - micro SD adapter included sometimes when you buy micro SD cards. A SD card of Class 10 and 8GB is recommended. Regarding MAC and USB-SD card adapters so should any generic adapter work. Ref.: $URL$ $URL$ 

The theoretical approach is : Power (watt) = U (voltage) x I (Current) And for the battery: = Current x Hours = Amp/Hours This is values from a specific setup, just here for reference. 

Yes. A relay or contactor (powerful relay) can control currencies in the 40Amp or more range (8kW = 8000/220v = 34 Amp). And your circuit could be a relay controlling a contactor since the Raspberry Pi can't handle the power required by a contactor. Wikipedia has a indepth article about relays, $URL$ 

From a previous discussion at the Raspberry Pi forum it looks unlikely that it supports MHL-HDMI. Ref.: $URL$ 

Answer: Yes! Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi 1A supports USB gadgets/OTG. Raspberry Pi 1B, Raspberry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3 have USB hubs integrated and cant utilize USB gadgets/OTG. USB gadgets/OTG is that you change the USB port from being a "USB host" to be a "USB client". Ref.: $URL$ 

A minor remark first: Raspberry Pi 3 its just the hardware, the question is regarding the OS (Operating System) example "Raspbian" and what date the image file have, there are differences in different OS versions. 1. Regarding Fixed IP. This is defined in the file . 

First check if there is a process running, . If thats the case, kill it with . Remove the lock file with That should do the trick. 

By removing the default gateway (example 192.168.nnn.nnn) from the LAN configuration, your routing table for 0.0.0.0 (Internet) there will be no rute to internet trough the LAN only via WiFi. 

Measure if the MQ2 sensors output have different values, measure with volt meter depending on the gas content. Add a potentiometer so you can simulate a input signal to the MCP3002. VCC to one end, input on MCP3002 to mid and GND to the other end. 

And then restart the network service This will bridge eth0 and eth1 into a bridge br0 and set the IP adr. on the br0 to 192.168.1.10 and blank the IP ad. on eth0 and eth1. 

And to troubleshoot, pipe the output from your python program to a file and add that to your question. Example: 

$URL$ I would recommend to meassure the power on your setup and calculate from that. And I would also recommend to search for "power conservation". Some other references: $URL$ $URL$ 

When a SD card is in a corrupt state indicate that there is something wrong: It could be the image transfer that went wrong = Try to transfer the image to the SD card again. Or the SD card is damaged or counterfeit, that can be checked with as SD card program, there are many out there, use a search engine and search for "check sd card". 

When you have two interfaces connected the routing table is deciding what interface to send out the trafic through.check the routing table with: 

Note. Never power cycle the Raspberry Pi, and by the way any OS it is the road to a corrupted file system. 

If you run will show the services running on your Raspberry Pi. What you need/can remove I can't advice you upon since it depends. 

If you want to use compression you don't need to punch the zeros with dd as zero blocks are highly compressible: 

When changing from master to client is usually refereed to as OTG. Since Raspberry Pi 3 have a built in USB hub it cant be a USB client. If you use a Raspberry Pi Zero (W) it supports "USB OTG" with the "USB Gadget", it will show it self as a Serial USB device, see ref. 2 and 3 below. 

The command is only showing interfaces that are . If you append a , it will show ALL interfaces, also the interfaces that are . 

And there is a substructure depending on release date for the image. The last Jessie is raspbian-2017-07-05. 

MQTT is a message transport protocol. Install "mosquitto" a MQTT hub on the central node, and the clients on the sensor nodes. See my reply here that describes MQTT a bit more: $URL$ 

and so on. The us addition to get the sum of all consumers and that will be the minimum current needed for a PSU. And off course add some leeway Reference : $URL$ 

If start.elf won't launch, it may be corrupt. Note that 4-flashes may point to a defective SD-card holder, if one or more of the data contacts is intermittent it can lead to this problem. Reference: $URL$ 

OpenCV is not capable of creating an video stream. Its only possible to render a video to file. So to stream the video file you need another application like GStreamer, VLC to mention some or use the streaming features in Python. If you wan't to run the OpenCV examples then you have to install a desktop famwork on the Raspberry Pi. 

is an indication that is running already and you can't start it twice. And before a it is recommended to do a backup. If you can edit the SD card in another computer and edit to . Ref.: $URL$ and thereafter run and follow the instructions. 

I will assume you are using apache. You can use virtual host, each virtual host detect the FQDN in the url (host + domain name) and direct it to the correct virtual host. Ref.: $URL$ 

First you need to implement a De-bounce circuit, it will prevent the mechanical contact that can bounce when they touch together and be read as multiple contacts. There is no "unused" current, the circuit will draw as much current as it need and the output will deliver it, if it can. 

The Ethernet Bridge could be the tool that is suitable for you. Install it with First create a bridge: 

This issue has been up in several foryums since the dawn of the Raspberry Pi. And culprit has been the SD card or the SD card holder. And to troubleshoot: 

The camera output is analog composite video and Raspberry doesn't have analog video input. There is analog composite video capture USB devices on the market. 

Bad SD card, either the creation of the SD card was unsuccessful or it is a bad card. Bad power supply, USB cable... 

Lets first define what a input vs a output is. Input is measuring if there is any voltage coming in or not on the GPIO pin. Output is driving a load to either to a high voltage, 3.3V or zero voltage. The load can be maximum 16mA. So when you measure (input) a voltage on a GPIO the only thing you have to consider is not to exceed 3.3 volt, the current is decided by the GPIO's internal resistance. Ref.: Section 6, $URL$ 

You need to configure the network, this is done by editing . The needs to be unique for each Raspberry Pi. And the is not needed if there is no router with internet access connected. So it looks something like this. 

Already answered here $URL$ Assuming you want to save /dev/sdXN to /tgtfs/image.rawand you are root: 

Depending on Raspberry Pi model you can or can't acomplish this task. It depends on the USB hardware interface. Model A, A+ and Zero has the hardware so it supports the USB OTG/Gadget. Model 2 and 3 doesn't support USB OTG/Gadget. 

PS: You should note that this is not a good idea on a flash memory based storage media (i.e. your source file system be SSD). 

There is recommendations to move extensive write to the SD card to either a RAM drive or to a USB flash or hard disk drive. And the cause for the corruption could be either extensive write to the SD card or a unmanaged poweroff. 

The command or show the status of ssh. And to find out if the port is open, , replace 172.21.2.0/24 with your network. 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS An Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) image is available for the Raspberry Pi 2, which combines the released 14.04 distribution with a PPA containing kernels and firmware which work on the Raspberry Pi 2. Warning ! This image, along with the one-off kernel it installs, is no longer maintained. Please use the 16.04 Xenial image instead. Warning ! Ref.: $URL$ I would suggest that you go for "ROS Lunar Loggerhead" that supports: 

So if you wan't to switch of the LED D0 you have to desolder it or the resistor R0, see schema below. To connect a GPIO pin to Vcc is asking for disaster, it is rated at max 16mA and the relay module consumes (Relay 120mA 0 two LEDs) approx 150mA, nearly ten times what the GPIO is capable off. 

I agree with all other answers, MAINS IS DEADLY! With that warning aside, a viable solution would be a opto coupler/isolator. A opto coupler separate the mains from the more sensitive GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. It contains a LED and a photo sensitive transistor. Between the halves is there no electric connection, just photons (light). An example on the schematic can you find in the reference. OBS the value of R85 could be another for your AC and is depending on the opto couplers LED's forward voltage, it need to be calculated Ref.: $URL$ 

In Stretch it's no longer , it uses the new way of naming interfaces, predictable interface names. To configure WiFi is well described here: $URL$ Adding the network details to the Raspberry Pi 

If you want to copy files from a USB stick to another with an Raspberry Pi, it's doable. The USB port on Raspberry Pi is a USB 2.0 there is alternatives like, Banana Pi, Orange Pi, Beagle Bone that have USB 3.0 that is faster. 

A more power full power supply (PSU) can't fry the Raspberry Pi. The current a PSU can deliver is depending on what your Raspberry Pi is consuming. It's like drinking water from a glass, if you have a large glass you will not drink more water, you drink the water you can drink, independently of the size of the glass. 

It depend on the type of load. An inductive DC load, like a motor needs a flyback diode as you state in your question. A MOSFET is a excellent idea, your only concern is that VGSon is below 3,3 volt (normaly called a TTL MOSFET). Or you have to add a transistor to drive the VGSon to the level that the MOSFET needs to be conducting. 

If USB Gadget is enabled a virtual ethernet channel can be created over the USB interface. Adafruit have made a nice article about "USB gadget" that explains all steps in detail: $URL$ There is restrictions like the onboard antenna in form of coverage/range. I would guesstimate that the restriction would be in the air interface due to distance between AP (RPi Z W) and your laptop. The steps to configure this is not so extensive and worth exploring and following the URL provided should get you going in a jiffy. 

Now you can simulate a voltage sent to the MCP3002 and see if you get any response in your python code by turning the potentiometer knob. Ref.: $URL$ 

If the file ssh is there it will enable ssh login. OBS the file is empty and has no extension. And the file with the content: 

php5-mysql is available in the previous version Jessie and NOT in Stretch. But Owncloud should be able to use php7 (php-mysql)! Ref.: $URL$ 

Strange that you have such a hard time finding one, I did use a search engine with "piezo 15mA" and the first two hits where 15mA/1.5volt piezo buzzers. And a caution, your circuit can break your Raspberry, since the total power consumption can supersede the total for a Raspberry Pi. The solution that makes sense is secure is a transistor and a couple of resistors, the way that you solve a circuit when having a MCU that isn't suited to drive a lot of loads! Regarding the specified "Buzzers Transducer" with the electrical specification of . 

To calculate the resistor you need to know some parameters regarding the LED. Normally a red LED has a forward voltage of approx 2volt and a current of 20mA and the output from the Raspberry Pi is 3,3volt. This means that 1,3volt (Raspberry voltage - LED voltage) and 20mA is the values for the resistors. then lets take 1,3v/0,02A = resistor (65ohm). And what GPIO pin to use, well that's up to which pin you fancy in the programming. Take a look at this video series, that will explain a lot: $URL$ Table for LED,voltage vs. color $URL$ 

It is possible to achive this. The USB port can be acting as a master (host) or a slave. *Using the Linux USB Gadget modules, we can get the Pi Zero to emulate a whole host of USB devices including
