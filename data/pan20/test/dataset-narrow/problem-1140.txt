DGS prove a hashing lemma that bijectively hashes a sparse set to a set from a smaller universe (without involving a primality test). In particular see Lemma 3 in the paper that maps a set of size at most $(\log n)^{1/3}$ from the universe $[n]$ to a set of size at most $v < \log{n}$ by using the hash function $((x \bmod{u})\bmod{v})$ where $u < n$. I guess in your setting the set consists of elements from $n$-bit numbers and you can therefore plug in $2^n$ instead of $n$ in the DGS-lemma. 

For a graph $G$, let $\rho(G) = \frac{2|E(G)|}{|V(G)|}$ be the average degree of a vertex. We say that a class of graphs $\mathcal{C}$ is maximally $\rho$-sparse - written as $\rho = \rho(\mathcal{C})$ i.e. the maximum of average density (with maximum taken over all graphs from $\mathcal{C}$ with sufficiently many vertices) approaches $\rho$. Note: Planar graphs can be proved to be biparted because Euler formula holds. The same is the case with bounded genus graphs. What about bounded tree-width graphs, graphs excluding a finite set of fixed minors,...? 

This problem was studied in the following paper. Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, S.Louis Hakimi, On computing a conditional edge-connectivity of a graph, Information Processing Letters, Volume 27, Issue 4, 1988, Pages 195-199, ISSN 0020-0190, $URL$ The idea is identical to Saeed's method, contract pairs of edges and find a min-cut. However, one can be more careful and show $O(m)$ pairs are sufficient. 

Let $y_i=\min\{b_k| i\in J_k\}$. Observe for any feasible solution, $x_i\leq y_i$. Claim: The system of $\max$ equations is feasible iff $x_i=y_i$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ is a solution. Proof. If $x_i=y_i$ is a solution, then the system of $\max$ equations is feasible Consider any solution, and $x_i < y_i$ for some $i$. We can increase $x_i$ to $y_i$ without violate any equation. Assume it violates the $k$th equation, namely $\max\{x_j|j,i\in J_k\}=b_k$, then it implies $y_i = \max\{x_j|j,i\in J_k\} > b_k$, but that's a contradiction because $$ b_k \geq \min\{b_j| i\in J_j\} = y_i = \max\{x_j|j,i\in J_k\} > b_k $$. The algorithm is just compute $y_i$s and check if it satisfies all the equations. This takes linear time. 

Finding a bit of $A^N[s,t]$ where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the given graph reduces to the problem $\mathsf{BitSLP}$ defined first in [ABKPM] which has a $\#\mathsf{P}$ lower bound established in the same paper. However whether the reduction in the reverse direction holds, i.e. from $\mathsf{BitSLP}$ to the matrix powering problem, is open AFAIK. Notice that $\mathsf{BitSLP}$ sits squarely inside the counting hierarchy $\mathsf{CH} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$. The best known upper bound on this problem viz. $\mathsf{PH}^{\mathsf{PP}^{\mathsf{PP}^{\mathsf{PP}}}}$ is from here. 

The following: CMTV, considers the complexity class $\#\mathsf{NC}^1$ which is (essentially, but in somewhat more general setting) the class of functions counting the number of accepting computations of a nondeterministic finite automaton on an input word of a certain length. Many results are now known about this complexity class including containment in deterministic logspace as a consequence of CDL. Notice that the automaton is fixed in this setting and the input word is the only input. 

Let $x_i \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, with the promise that $x = \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} \in \{0,1\}$ (where the sum is over $\mathbb{Z}$). Then what is the complexity of determining if $x = 1$? Notice that trivially the problem lies in $\cap_{m \geq 2}{\mathsf{AC}^0[m]}$ because $x \equiv 1\bmod{m}$ iff $x = 1$. Question is: does the problem lie in $\mathsf{AC}^0$? If so, what is the circuit witnessing this? If not, how does one prove this? 

There is a randomized algorithm for computing Gomory-Hu tree in $\tilde{O}(|E||V|)$ time when all edges have capacity 1. Once you have the Gomory-Hu tree, you can process it so you can answer maximum flow queries between two vertices in constant time. 

We can reduce this problem to your problem: Split each vertex of $G$, so each vertex $v$ in $G$ become $v^-$ and $v^+$, and edge $uv$ become $u^+v^-$, also there are edges $v^-v^+$. Add one new vertex $u$, and edges $t_1^+u$ and $us_2^-$. Let this graph be $G'$. There exist a path from $s_1^-$ to $t_2^+$ in $G'$ that uses $u$ if and only if there exist a node disjoint path between $(s_1,t_1)$ and $(s_2,t_2)$ in $G$. 

For a simple graph, the local edge connectivity of vertices $x,y$ where $x\neq y$ is $\lambda(x,y)$ and defined as the maximum number of edge disjoint paths from $x$ to $y$. One can find this by a maximum flow computation. Define that 

There is the common dynamic programming algorithm taught in algorithm classes, which takes $O(n |X|)$ time. It takes $O(n^2)$ time for large input sets. It's not hard to devise and output sensitive version that takes $O(|X||S_n(X)|+n)$ time. It's possible to solve it in $O((n \log n)^\frac{3}{2})$ time by decompose the problem to $\sqrt{n\log n}$ ALL-SUBSET-SUMS with small output size, and we can combine the solutions through FFT. How fast can we solve this problem? There are subset sum algorithms using analytical number theory[1], but they have many technical conditions on the input. It can't be applied directly on ALL-SUBSET-SUMS. Reference: [1] M. Chaimovich , G. Freiman , Z. Galil, Solving dense subset-sum problems by using analytical number theory, Journal of Complexity, v.5 n.3, p.271-282, Sept. 1989 

I am not sure if this is very relevant but in Log-Space Algorithms for Paths and Matchings in k-Trees (building on a long history of past work and specifically on Arithmetizing classes around NC1 and L by Limaye-Mahajan-Rao) we show how to find recursive balanced separators for a tree in Logspace. This bound may very well be improvable to $\mathsf{NC}^1$ if the input tree is directly given in the string representation. The basic idea is to represent the tree as a parenthesis expression and find balanced separators for these. Notice that we find leaf separators i.e. subtrees which are balanced w.r.t. number of leaves. 

Notice that I do not care about $f$ as long as it is a constant but $s$ (as a fraction of $\sqrt{n}$) is crucial for me. Some background: Lipton-Tarjan gave a $(c\sqrt{n},\frac{2}{3})$-balanced planar (vertex) separator for some constant $c$. Subsequently Miller gave a similar separator that is also a cycle but in triangulated planar graphs. If we omit the triangulated condition (say replace it by $2$-vertex connected) there might not exist an $(O(\sqrt{n}),O(1))$-cycle separator - case in point being a cycle on $n$ vertices. We can choose to ignore such easy (e.g. all bounded tree-width) cases.

To clarify, I'm looking for dictionaries with space requirement as a function of the size of the universe, and not the number of elements in the dictionary. 

Let $d^+_G(x)$ be the in-degree of $x$ in graph $G$. Theorem (Lovász 1973): For a directed graph $G$ and a specified vertex $r$, there exist a subgraph $G'$ with the property that $d^+_{G'}(x) = \lambda(r,x,G') = \lambda(r,x,G)$. The desired sparse graph exists, as we can keep removing edges to reach a minimal graph with the desired connectivity property. 

Your problem is NP-hard. Consider a partition problem instance with input $a_1,\ldots,a_n$. We create a complete bipartite graph with $2$ source vertices each with capacity $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i$, and $n$ sink vertices, where the $i$th vertex has capacity $a_i$. Each edge has infinite capacity. It's easy to verify there is a partition with equal sum if and only if the solution to your problem on $G$ has $n$ edges. 

Let $G$ be a digraph (not necessarily a DAG) and let $s,t \in V(G)$. What is the complexity of counting the number of simple $s-t$ paths in $G$. I would expect the problem to be #${\mathsf P}$-complete but have not been able to locate an exact reference. Also notice that a number of similar questions have been answered correctly here and elsewhere but not this precise question - to emphasise I am not interested in counting walks and/or undirected graphs (in the first case the variant is in ${\mathsf P}$ and in the other #${\mathsf P}$-hard). 

For matrices of sizes $k = 2,3$ the Matrix Powering Positivity Problem is in $\mathsf{P}$ (cf. this paper to appear in STACS 2015) 

Here MAJ $:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ outputs 1 iff at least half of its inputs are $1$. I care only about the size of the circuit (ought to be polynomial) and that an input should be read only once though the fan-out of an input gate can be arbitrary (this crucially affects the tree-width of the circuit - the branching programs obtained from Barrington's theorem from the MAJ $\in$ $\mathsf{NC}^1$, interpreted as skew circuits, do not help). And of course the tree-width is the most crucial thing. I do not care about the depth or any other parameter. Some of the common circuits for MAJ include: 

Here is an example of a non-trivial good matrix. $$\left( \begin{array}{cc} \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} \\ -\frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} \\ \end{array} \right)$$ 

In the proof of theorem 2 in Improved Approximation Algorithms for Rectangle Tiling and Packing by Berman et al, they proved an upper bound of $\frac{11}{5} \max\{W/p,y\}$, where $W$ is the sum of the weight of all elements, $p$ is the number of rectangles and $y$ is the weight of the largest element. This implies a upper bound of $\frac{11}{5j}$ for your problem. 

For a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, a subgraph of $O(kn)$ edges is an $r$-rooted-$k$-sparsifier if it preserves the local edge connectivity from $r$ to every other vertex up to $k$. Namely, it is a subgraph $G_k$, such that $\lambda(r,x,G_k)\geq \min(\lambda(r,x,G),k)$ for all $x\in V$. Here $\lambda(x,y,G)$ is the maximum number of edge disjoint paths from $x$ to $y$. For undirected graphs, Nagomochi and Ibaraki shows such graph exist and has an algorithm to find a $r$-rooted-$k$-sparsifier in $O(m)$ time. In fact, it finds a subgraph preserves all local edge and vertex connectivity. Are there similar results for directed graphs? Or are there a proof that a $r$-rooted-$k$-sparsifier cannot exist for some directed graph? 

Maximal Planar Bipartite graphs are sparser than maximal planar graphs. For which other classes of graphs are maximal Bipartite members sparser than arbitrary maximal members. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a class of graphs and let $\mathcal{B}$ be the class of bipartite graphs. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is biparted if $\rho(\mathcal{C}) > \rho(\mathcal{B}\cap\mathcal{C})$ (where $\rho(\mathcal{C})$ is defined below) i.e. the asymptotic density of arbitrary graphs in the class is larger than the asymptotic density of the bipartite graphs in the same class. Examples of biparted graphs are: 

An $(s,f)$- balanced separator in a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of $s$ vertices removing which yields connected compoennts of size at most $f|V|$. If the vertices of $S$ form a cycle of length $s$, $S$ is said to be a cycle-separator. 

From the algorithmic proof of Lipton-Tarjan's planar separator theorem we can, in time linear in the size of the graph, find a partition of vertices of the graph into three sets $A,B,S$ such that there are no edges with one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$, $S$ has size bounded by $O(\sqrt{n})$ and both $A,B$ have sizes upper bounded by $\frac{2}{3}$ of the number of vertices. Notice that any triangle in the graph either lies entirely inside $A$ or entirely inside $B$ or uses at least one vertex of $S$ with the other two vertices from $A \cup S$ or both from $B \cup S$. Thus it suffices to count the number of triangles in the graph on $S$ and the neighbours of $S$ in $A$ (and similarly for $B$). Notice that $S$ and its $A$-neighbours induce a $k$-outer planar graph (the said graph is a subgraph of a planar graph of diameter $4$). Thus counting the number of triangles in such a graph can be done directly by dynamic programming or by an application of Courcelle's theorem (I know for sure that such a counting version exists in the Logspace world by Elberfeld et al and am guessing that it also exists in the linear time world) since forming an undirected triangle is an $\mathsf{MSO}_1$ property and since a bounded width tree decomposition is easy to obtain from an embedded $k$-outer planar graph. Thus we have reduced the problem to a pair of problems which are each a constant fraction smaller at the expense of a linear time procedure. Notice that the procedure can be extended to find the count of the number of instances of any fixed connected graph inside an input graph in $O(n\log{n})$ time. 

Let $f$ be the running time of calling the oracles, and assume $f=\Omega(m+n)$, then one can find the sets in deterministic $O(f k \log n~\mathrm{polylog}(m))$ time. [1] Now we can reduce the finding witness problem to $1$-reconstruction problem. Here $S_1,\ldots,S_{2n}\subset \{1,\ldots,2n\}$ where $S_i = \{a|a+b = i, a\in A, b\in B\}$. Define the polynomials $\chi_Q(x) = \sum_{i \in Q} x^i$, $I_Q(x) = \sum_{i \in Q} i x^i$ The coefficient for $x^i$ in $\chi_Q\chi_B(x)$ is $|S_i\cap Q|$ and in $I_Q\chi_B(x)$ is $\sum_{s\in S_i\cap Q} s$. Hence the oracles take $O(n\log n)$ time per call. This gives us an $O(n~\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ time deterministic algorithm.

Let $S(X) = \{\sum_{i\in Y} i | Y\subset X \}$, the set of subset sums of $X$. $S_n(X) = S(X)\cap \{1,\ldots,n\}$. Consider the following variant of subset sum.
