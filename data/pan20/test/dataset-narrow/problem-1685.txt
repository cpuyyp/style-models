As far as I know installing a program installs its man page(s) as well, so AFAIK you would have to uninstall and the reinstall any program you want the man pages for. Or, option 2, you can look on the either $URL$ or manpages.debian.net, and read them there. I would go for the manpages.debian.net, as Raspbmc (and Raspbian) is based off Debian, so that site would be the closest you would get to an official Raspbmc/Raspbian man page site. 

and then it goes to staticy nothing. I really hope I haven't nuked my Pi, but it looks that way, at least the RCA adapter. I can connect and do everything via the USB Console cable I have, but I don't get any graphics on my screen. I did add some files via my MicroSD card reader (MicroSD slides into slot on the reader which goes to USB) right before the problems began. I have never used the reader before, so I don't know if this is unusual. I haven't tried HDMI yet, but I will as soon as I can. I have re-imaged my SD card since this problem started using the same afore-mentioned SD card reader. I will try re-imaging with the MicroSD Card adapter (MicroSD to SD) in my SD card reader to see if that solves the problem. Have I fried my RCA Video somehow, or is this because of something internal? Please help, I really like my Raspberry Pi and don't want to have to pay for a new one. Edit: I re-imaged using the MicroSD Card adapter (MicroSD to SD) and same problem. 

This is an answer for this question that was solved in the comments. Basically, the permissions weren't correct for the minecraft-pi executable, probably because of permissions from where the minecraft-pi executable was downloaded from. This is how to fix it: 

So, my best guess would be that yes. The new Raspberry Pi 2's GPIO will work exactly the same. However, like @joan mentioned, this new Pi has just barely been announced - and nobody has really had time to experiment on it - so we can't be entirely sure. 

Hope this helps! Of course, there are other methods out there, but these are just two I found quickly. 

I've been messing around with Sonic-Pi lately, trying to figure out various things. One thing I'm finding I want to be able to do is play a continuous MIDI tone/note. However, the closest thing I can figure out how to do is play the note repeating very quickly, which leads to a wave affect. While it doesn't sound bad, I still want to be able to create background tones that just play continuously. It would make sense that you can do this, but I can't find out how, especially seeing as Sonic-Pi is so new. I'd love to do more with it, but this is kind of blocking my path. I'm planning on researching the language/software/engine behind Sonic-Pi (can't remember what it's called - SuperCollider and/or Clojure I believe) and seeing if I can't figure this out via learning at a lower level. However, until then I figured I would ask and see if anyone knows how to do this, or have done it themselves. 

hustlerinc found his answer thanks to my mentioning of the issue with certain SD cards with NOOBS 1.3 Quote: RPi Awesomeness 

I am using Raspbian 2013-07-26 and I have been having a lot of trouble with my Pi lately (cheap SD card I'm thinking, lots of corrupt stuff). Anyways, when I try to boot it I get this on the screen (lines are more angular on screen, it's somewhat distorted because it's a picture of a screen: 

No reason to use an SSD. The Pi only has USB 2.0 ports, so the SSD would be pretty throttled by the medium of transfer (USB). However, I would hardly, as Ghanima and Lenik have mentioned, consider the Pi a piece of "mission critical hardware". 

So I did this and then proceeded on to step two. This is where my problem begins (I think.) I started another terminal for connecting to my Pi and entered the command given to me in step two: 

I could be wrong, so if that fails, try though 1 is the boot partition number in my case and thus would be what it looks like should go in that file. 

What am I doing wrong? My Ubuntu system is totally up to date (just ran apt-get upgrade last night) and I just installed ppp onto my Pi about 20 minutes ago ( as of 2:30 10/31/2013) Thanks! 

lines to and then ran as mentioned on the wiki page for developing Maynard on the Pi. I know the source packages lines are correct, as they showed up when I ran . However, when I got to the 

This is caused by you not having the Permissions to get software lock on dpkg. Thus, you need to run the apt-get commands with sudo: . If you are still getting this issue after running with sudo, try running and then . Sometimes if a process that has lock on or and it quits suddenly, it causes issues, as the lock file isn't removed like it should. To explain file locks, it's basically a way of keeping certain files and software from being accessed and modified by multiple things (software or people) at once. You can read here for a more in-depth explanation. From the Link: 

Download Minecraft Pi either via Extract the minecraft-pi tarball via Run into the folder via From within the mcpi folder run and Minecraft Pi should start up! 

Then, you can input the name of the shortcut you want, the command, and the tooltip, as well as change the logo (not to mention more advanced features.) You'd probably want to check the Runs in Terminal Emulator option: 

or, you can set the preferred output mode prior to booting NOOBS by editing the the file in the root NOOBS directory prior to booting NOOBS and tacking on the following line to the end: . being 1-4, same as the buttons, each causes NOOBS to default to a different display mode. 

To edit the whitelist/blacklist: . To install it, just run the usual then (checks for updated software, upgrades any software to the newest available version) and then run . 

Like Goldilocks said, if java -version is showing 1.8, that is what is being used. The only reason I can think that the desktop version is saying 1.6 is because the .desktop file for the JRE or the shortcut on the menu didn't get updated. I can't confirm this or give a way to fix it right now, as my Pi is fried :'( but everything should be using 1.8. 

Like @Ghanima said in the comments, this question is a bit too non-specific and I'm not sure exactly what you want. However, I think I can provide a basic answer.
