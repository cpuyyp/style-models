If you make yourself the owner of the directory used by the webserver, chances are you will experience troubles and - at worst - the webserver will stop to run. Whenever possible, avoid to change owners and permission of system directories and files (see my second alternative proposal). If you still want to use the CLI but can't really suffer to type "sudo " in front to your commands, you could however... Include yourself in the group that folder is owned by, and make sure group permission is W 

Again: you can never know for sure. I have still a 5 Gb unit from the 90's up and running, for example. But consider this: you normally would keep backups of a totally healthy HD because it might - all of a sudden - fail. Now, you have an HD with visible signs of bad health status, heating up like crazy, having degraded performance and failing tests... if I were you, I would definitively hope for the best but prepare for the worst! Hope this helps, and if you try the cryo trick (the ice thing) I would be very interested to know the outcome of it. Best luck! 

Unless you find some official documentation, this is a question one might only infer the answer to. You can pick your favorite one: from marketing reasons (so you do not immediately notice defects!) to human mistakes (it's just a bug, it should report "not passed") transiting by design ones ("pass" means the HD is still usable, the test that fails signal the fact a non-essential subsistem is broken) 

What version of ubuntu do you use? What version of bash? Mine is version 4.0.33(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)... I am asking just in case the two different messages are both from bash but from different versions... What does 

I do not have any MS operating system so I could not try this myself, from this page on the windows 7 forums - though - it seems like the startup repair utility (SRU) is also included in OEM distros of the system. My understanding of that page is that you can then boot, with the help of a liveCD or usb drive into your existing windows 7 and from there run the SRU. If my understanding is correct, then you can most probably boot your system from the linux installation CD you originally used to install linux or by means of a dedicated tool, like the Super Grub Disk. Two scenarios that might fit your bill seem to be this and this. Another less elegant solution would be to repair Grub [the Super Grub Disk comes in help in this scenario too] and let GRUB launch Windows 7 for you. 

This is the PPA of the team packaging it for ubuntu . Once you add the PPA to the repositories, you can then use synaptics to install it. As of today, the repo is updated with packages for Jaunty. I did not try it myself, but it could work for karmic esily. EDIT: ~quack in the comments suggests to rebuild packages for Karmic from PPA sources... that seems like a sound idea to me! 

I suspect there is not a definitive answer. While the amount of charge of a battery is a definite, known quantity, passed to the computer by the chip on the battery, the estimate duration of a battery charge is done by dividing that quantity by the average energy consumption for a given unit of time. It might well be that your debian and ubuntu installations have a different record of your battery usage history (e.g. they have a different record of how much energy you typically use in one unit of time). In some cases it's possible to make the measurament more accurate by actually doing a couple of complete cycles (full charge -> full discharge) while using the computer normally. An experiment you can do is to actually check if the actual duration of the battery is the same under debian and under ubuntu. Should you find that is not the case, than you would know it's not a difference in the recorded data, but some difference in the system configuration that brings to an actual different power usage. If you will do any of these test, I would be very much interested to hear what was the outcome, as I am a GNU/linux user (various flavours) too! 

I am not sure I got your question right.... is there a problem with the graphic card that supports higher resolutions than 1024x768 but ubuntu does not give this option, or you are fine with the resolution but would like icons and text to use less pixels, so that you can put more of that on the screen? If it is the first case, than an easy workaround is to use the proprietary graphic drivers (from System / Administration / Hardware drivers). If it is the second case, than you have a few settings available from System / Preferences / Appearance, where you can choose different themes, fonts, icon sets, etc... You can also browse plenty of gnome themes here and check if there's any that meets your needs. HTH! 

I assume you are experiencing this with Karmic, aren't you? The point is that Karmic has changed a lot of things in its pulse audio configuration and you cannot anymore choose from GUI what channels to control your media keys. The solution depends from your hardware, but you can most probably fix this by: 

It is impossible to say for sure, as we can't for sure say if the heat is a symptom or a cause. I would tend however to support your thesis, though, as heat affects magnetic properties of materials. Although it is unlikely that your HD reached any close to the curie temperature, heat can still weaken the magnetic proprieties of materials, as cold improves them. It might be (but this is just an hypothesis) that the magnetic proprieties of the disk surface or of the writing heads have weakened. Also, heat can have deformed the physical shape of some component, making them less effective (for example a writing head which is now further away from the disk surface). A test you could do is to wrap your HD in a watertight plastic bag and immerse it in a bowl of crumbled ice (even better: you can mix the crumbled ice with salt, that brings the temperature down to circa -21Â°C) and repeat the tests there. You might notice an increase of performance. Incidentally his is a technique that - through contraction of the materials - is also useful to unstuck movable parts (which does not seem your problem, as normally a stuck movable part means no read and no write capabilities at all). Another common cause of disk failure is vibration. Vibration brings lack of precision in the moving parts, tear of joints, wrong alignments between heads and disk surface, and so on and so forth. In case something is now impeding the disk to revolve smoothly, you would for sure have extra heat generated by both the friction and the increased power used by the engine to keep up the rotation at the same speed. In this scenario heat would be a symptom rather than the cause of your problems. 

Ideas? Yes! :) Solutions? Not sure! :( It might be a compatibility issue between Compiz (desktop compositing manager using OpenGL and installed by default by Karmic) and your graphic card. If this is the case you could try one of the following: 

If you are a GUI person, you can alternatively open the file navigator with gksudo See the ubuntu wiki for more information and how-to. 

Your problem might be linked to the fact that Karmic and pulseaudio try to retrieve information about the dB settings of your card, and many linux drivers are broken in that regard. If that is the problem, you could try to give ignore_dB=1 to module-udev-detect in /etc/pulse/default.pa. That means that your line should look something like: 

Fascinating problem. I do not have a out-of-the-box solution but a couple of leads and alternate ways of doing that. Leads 

I was never able to fix the problem with that release, but the new LTS 12.04 does not present the same problem any more. 

You could try to investigate more by running on a TTY (ctrl-alt-F2, for example) the programs (show you CPU usage) to rule out #1 and (shows amount of used memory) to rule out #2. Of course you should do this while on the graphical console you start your GUI session. If it's #3, then you should investigate your logs. You could use bootchart as suggested in furtelwart answer (+1) or looking at the logs directly. All relevant logs in ubuntu are under the directory. I use Gnome/GDM and my logs are stored under . Chances are yours will be under . HTH! 

This is not exactly an answer, but more of a collection of ideas on how to track down your problem. In my experience, these kind of delays happen because of one of the following: 

I believe you are right: the problem seems to be due to the XP bootloader "gone with the wind". Does any of these how-to help? 

They are commonly included in the repos of all the major distros. ffmpeg and mencoder are used as a backend by several linux apps, so you can either use some CLI ninja skills or do it via GUI as for example this one. AFAIK, although VLC is best known in the form of GUI application you can also use it from command-line. You also have the option to use video editing software like OpenShot or Kino to do your editing first and then save it as mpeg-2 files. Once you are all set up with your files, you can then create a regular DVD to be played in domestic appliances with - amongst others - dvdauthor. Finally there is a package called videotrans, which is a collection of scripts and tools for creating DVD's. Here's the project brief description:
