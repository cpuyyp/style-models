Here is a list of Microsoft command line switches, but not all work for all programs or patches. $URL$ 

Then run gpupdate /force from a command prompt. If you have a home version of the OS, go to this registry key: 

Enable the firewall, and block any ports his applications use, usually a random port between 1024-65535 for torrent apps, so block them all. You can do this for his IP address specifically, be warned, he may try to change his IP address to get around it, so you may need to include multiple IP's. You can try giving yourself a static IP address of 192.168.1.2 for example, and then deny every other address above it access to those ports. 

It should default to "Import from another program or file", Go down to "Outlook Data File" and hit Next. Browse to your PST, and hit Next. It will ask you where you want to import it to, and you will click "Import items into the same folder in:" and then pull down your Exchange mailbox in the drop-down box, and click "Finish". 

The Junk E-mail folder is a system folder like Sent Items, Inbox, Deleted Items, so it cannot be removed or hidden. 

If it is purely an HTTP proxy, it is using port 80, so the basic answer is no to that specifically. NTP uses UDP port 123. If it is a more generic proxy server, serving all ports, then maybe. There are some programs out there that do NTP over HTTP. I do not use Linux, but this one might do it: $URL$ (still not sure if this will do authentication either). I could not find one for Windows, but I will post back if I do. 

All I can say is check the refresh rate of the monitor in the video settings. Make it as high as you can. You may need to install a specific monitor driver to allow for higher refresh rates. If that does not work, call IT back in and make them figure it out. 

Until you say otherwise, I am going to assume that you are talking about the Q8200. I have bad news for you: That processor does not have that functionality so you are only going to be able to virtualize 32-bit OS'es. See the matrix linked below: $URL$ 

The XPS is the Dell gaming line, purchased from Alienware a few years back. The Inspiron is the home line. For most purposes, the Inspiron will probably be fine for you, but the XPS is definitely a better computer. Also from your links, the XPS has a better processor, and is probably running at a higher clock rate internally. It is hard to be more precise since the links are not complete specs. 

Found is a folder that use used when the files system can no longer tell where they should rightfully be due to corruption. I would open that Found folder and copy them to another location. After that, if that folder is on her computer, I would open a command bod and run this command: chkdsk /f and answer yes to doing it on reboot. Reboot the computer. I would do this at least twice. If the Found folder is on the camera's memory, I would copy all the files off, and then format the removable memory card. This is a cautionary tale to ALWAYS copy your pictures off the camera and eventually to a DVD or other secure place. 

I would ask, how do you think you are using IPsec? Between what hosts would you be using it? The chances are you have zero reason for it. IP sec is used on internal networks to make sure that people can't use programs like Wireshark to capture and decode packets. It requires both ends of the connection to agree to use it. As you browse the Internet, and use other protocols out there for different applications, those foreign hosts are not going to be setting up IPsec tunnels with you. A VPN may use IPsec, but I think that is mostly site-to-site VPN's, not the type you might commonly use, and they have their own methods of encryption. So if you are on a home network, and you REALLY think that someone can physically tap into your network, and REALLY has the desire to run a protocol sniffer, then by all means, set it up. Of course, the chances of that are 1 in a million, so buy a lottery ticket too. 

to make sure that Office is completely gone, then reinstall Office, and re-create the Outlook profile. Regarding your comment about the Installer service, these say XP, server 2003, but should also guide you with Windows 7. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

No, there is no option you can set to do it automatically every time as you requested...that cannot be done because that is programmatic for each application or update package, but as the others said, you can just manually shut down. 

Do this as a test: Right click on Computer>Properties>Advanced System Properties>Advanced>Performance>Visual Effects, and set them as I have them in the screenshot, and see if that makes any difference. If it does, you will then know where to look, and you can play with the setting from there to balance performance with appearance. I would also be looking at my mouse driver, and mouse settings in Control Panel. 

An OST is not a PST. They are not the same in file structure or function. An OST is ONLY for the cached copy of Exchange data. You cannot read it or use it the way you would a PST. Create a new PST and use it. 

Go into the Power Options in Control Panel, then click on "Change Plan Settings" for your plan, then there should be an option "Change advanced power settings", then look under the "Hard Disk" and "USB Settings" areas. This one may not be the actual answer, but set your "Turn off Hard Disk after" to never (set 0), but I think the real one is to set "USB selective suspend settings" to "disabled" at least when plugged in...but maybe also when on battery if you are using it that way when it happens. In response to your comment that it did not work, try this too. Go into device manager, to the USB root hubs, and turn off the save power option. Also try to do it for your disk too under hard disks (it may not have this option, but check anyway). 

If you look at them, they are not very understandable, so I am not sure how well you would do editing them. I suggest that you consider making a new user and its profile, set the "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Notification Area Icons" for that one icon (at least) to "Show Icon and Notifications". Then reboot to release the profile, and log in as administrator. Copy that profile to the "" profile. You can do that either manually using Explorer, or the way we used to do it in "" "". It will be grayed out, but you can use the Windows Enabler to get around that. 

Hit ALT+Spacebar+N. I do that every day, and it is an easy combination. This can work with, or without, the "Hide When Minimized" option selected. 

Yes, you can copy the old one to the new profile, but the name of the file, Outlook.NK2 will match your profile name, which is Outlook by default, so if you created a new profile name, make sure that the NK2 file matches it. 

This is because without network discovery, your server cannot use broadcasts to resolve hosts. In a Microsoft domain, they use a local DNS server, which all the local Microsoft Windows computers register their host name with with in DNS, so that is how they find each other. If you are not running a Domain, or internal DNS server, you are turning off the only way they can find each other unless you add entries to the HOSTS file. The cache you are talking about is very volatile, and gets flushed often (almost certainly when turning network discovery on and off). If you want something permanent, short of running the DNS service on that server, use the HOSTS file located here: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\HOSTS (it is read only, so uncheck it before you make changes). 

Try hitting F8 on boot up before Windows starts (the same as where you would select Safe Mode), and load the "Last known good configuration". Last known good is written only after you have logged in, and since you have not logged in since, it should work. Since that did not work, you will need to use System Restore from a command prompt in "Safe Mode Command Prompt Only". Follow this Microsoft document on exactly how to do it: $URL$ 

It does not mean you have a virus. In fact, I doubt any virus files would have old data stamps unless you had been infected for a long time (since the date stamp). When you are installing Windows, for example, there is not yet any mechanism that updates the files as they are written, so you get the original dates that were on the files when they were put on the installation media. My system is almost surely not infected, but the date on my Notepad.exe is 7/13/2009. You are probably fine, but if you have any reason to believe you are infected, by all means, run some scans. 

Deleting the job in Task Scheduler brings you back to the original screen in the Control Panel Backup panel. 

I just spent about an hour trying to make this work exactly as you wanted somehow. I experimented, and searched and searched, but I could not get it perfect, but I was able to come up with something. I tried every combination of shutdown (-i -c -d options), but nothing. I also experimented with the GUI interface after the -i option. I also tried changing the balloon time display so it would stay down in the systray longer, but still, even that disappears. The closest I go with with this sample command: I think the fact is that they simply changed the way it works, and I don't think there is any way around it 100%, but the now brings up a dialog box, whereas it used to bring up the screen you wanted. When I used the in Windows 7, I had to fill out the box, and here was the result: 

This is for Windows, it may be slightly different for Linux. You can ask your administrator what ports your specific type of VPN uses. Of course, simply trying it is the easiest way since if it does not connect, chances are you can't fix the problem anyway. 

I believe you may be having may be having issues with your computer trying to connect to a network location that is no longer there. This causes time-outs and slowness. I fixed this issue on a computer just yesterday. Try the following: 

They are indeed backwards compatible. It would be an anomaly if they were not. Some drives are set with a jumper. $URL$ Practical discussion with guys who have done it: $URL$ (read all the way down though) 

Sorry, but Home Premium does not allow you to work in the language of your choice: $URL$ (last one) If you do upgrade, here is a link on how to install language support: $URL$ 

Yes, it can be done. I do not know about other firewalls, but SonicWALL can do it with what they call transparent mode (aka bridged), configured on the LAN interface in this screenshot. In the TZ series (the model shown is a TZ190), it can be configured to bridge to the OPT (DMZ) or LAN interface, or in the PRO series to any interface except X1 (itself). 

You do not need any outside software, just use this document to show you how to configure it natively: $URL$ (read the section "Configuring the Windows Time service to use an external time source") 

It sounds like the motherboard, and short of picking up another one on eBay, it is probably toast. This does give me a moment to discuss laptops and fans, in general. The fans in laptops are UBER important, yet they do not tend to be that durable. First, make sure that in the future, you have compressed air to blow out the fans the best you can through the exhaust ports at least monthly. If you have enough skill, consider taking the plastic off yearly to blow it out even better. If your laptop is under warranty, and you have even the remotest doubt that the fan could be going, have them change it. If your laptop is out of warranty, pick up a spare or two for your model on eBay. Replacing the fans is akin to changing your oil. You may not have to do it quite as often, but it will potentially make your laptop last years longer. 

You cannot go from 32-bit to 64-bit or 64-bit to 32-bit without a complete reinstall. I suspect that when you did your "upgrade", you performed a complete reinstall, overwriting your 64-bit installation, and killing all your previously-installed programs. The only other possibility is that maybe you somehow did the install to an empty partition, and the original partition remains untouched. This is EXTREMELY unlikely, but you can see if there are any other partitions in the Disk Manager. 

and hit enter. Go to the startup tab, and uncheck those two programs (you will probably have to reboot), then test. If you don't like the results, you can just reenable them. 

I came late to this question. Based on what you are saying, someone could somehow be logging in as you. I can't think of another reason if you have not left some detail out inadvertently. To answer your sub-question: You can't see where the other login is taking place. So let's assume that that is actually happening, I can't believe that no one has not said this yet: CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD ASAP. Also change your security question and answer. 

This is not part of the question, but I was wondering exactly how long it would take: USB 2.0 has a transfer rate of 480 MBit/s, or 53.248 MB/s. 300 Gigabytes is 307200 Megabytes / 53.248 MB = 5769 seconds = 96 minutes This free software reviews great and seems to fit your need: $URL$ Here is one more that also might: $URL$ 

Make sure that the figure is not set to zero, and probably should be at least 5. If it is, you then need to figure out where it is getting the policy from (probably domain GP, but could be local, and you can check that with gpedit.msc), and change it. 

You can't convert IPv6 to the decimal numbers you are looking for. That is a different number, the IPv4 address. Open a command prompt, and just do IPCONFIG (not case sensitive) and hit enter. Your IP address for any adapters you have will be there, and you can use that.
