Extract the file using 7-Zip. Among the extract files there's one called . Extract it through 7-Zip. Copy the and files in whatever folder you like. Rename the copied files to and , respectively. 

Command-line interface Windows XP doesn't provide a way to list compressed files out of the box, and even the advanced search methods aren't designed for such tasks. The command prompt comes to the rescue: 

Missing fonts The system will simply fail to load if the folder is empty or missing entirely. In Windows XP, for example, you would get this error: 

Note that those parameters have to be used both for and commands, if needed. To list uncompressed files, you can use the parameter of the command to reverse the filter, and change the value to (that's because uncompressed files don't have the marker, which affects the string tokenization). Further reading 

Windows registry The registry doesn't need to be cleaned. Avoid using such "optimizers," because they can do more harm than good, as you noticed. 

Solution Despite its name, the command is able to handle both files and folders. Here's a batch script that does the job: 

Repeat step 5 for any other file that needs to be fixed. Take ownership and full control over the folder: 

Copy the Google Chrome application shortcut, and paste it to the desktop. Right-click the pasted shortcut, and choose Properties from the context menu. Edit the Target field by adding a space character and the following switch at the very end: 

Locate the value, and set it to . Note In case the value is missing, create a new (32-bit) value. While you could set it to , that would prevent modal dialog boxes from properly regaining focus. Log off and log back on to apply the changes. 

Here's a JScript-based script I've written which can translate a binary file to its hexadecimal representation, and vice-versa. Save the code as , or whatever you want as long it has the extension. 

Quick analysis During its startup phase, Windows Photo Viewer uses the API function to check whether the system was started in safe mode. If that's the case, it will display the following message: 

Possible solutions Below there's a few batch scripts which can check whether the operating system is Windows 8.1, with or without KB2919355. The exit code will be one of the following: 

Post-processing Just some ways to overcome the limitations. Manual sort If needed, you can manually sort the output by using the command in a command prompt. Example usage 

Disable specific hotkeys Although undocumented, File Explorer (previously known as Windows Explorer) provides a per-user registry entry which can selectively disable some Explorer-related hotkeys. The registry value is called and is located at: 

Given the above, it's reasonable to think any newer IE version would require the update as a prerequisite, just like SP2 is required to install IE 9 on Windows Vista. 

Note In order to enable/disable any device, must be run with admin rights. Determine the required hardware identifiers 

Filtering the details Running the will produce a report file (usually found in ) which contains a wealth of information. In order to get the juicy bits, open a command prompt, and execute this command: 

Disabling localized names Windows Explorer doesn't seem to provide any documented way to ignore folder localization, but removing the line does the job. While you could also delete the file entirely, it's not a good idea as you would lose other customization settings such as icons or tooltips. Batch automation Below there's a simple batch script which can do that for you, recursively scanning every folder in the system drive. Make sure to run it as administrator. 

Since Windows 2000, the registry value can be used to remap a key to another or disable it entirely. The scan code mappings are stored in the following registry key: 

Retrieving file names only In case you don't care about the full path, you can use the batch script below. The usage isn't any different from the batch script above. Batch script 

Manually install the Adobe Flash Player plug-in Tested with Opera 12.17 / Adobe Flash Player 14.0.0.125 on Windows 7 SP1 x86 (32-bit). Getting just the Flash Player plug-in file (and nothing else) requires some work, because it comes bundled with a proprietary setup package which can't be unpacked easily. To avoid an actual installation you can take advantage of virtualization software. For example you could install the package in a virtual machine, and then copy the required files to the main system. In this case a simpler alternative is to use JauntePE, a portable application creator. 

The Antimalware Service Executable () is part of the Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) engine. Assuming you have it installed, it might have crashed for some reason and now Windows asks you to send an error report. Although you don't have to, it's probably a legitimate dialog which should look like this: 

Note The official documentation is not up-to-date. The value was meant to be in stored the root application key, but that's no longer the case as of Windows XP. Additional information 

Log on with an administrator account. Press Win+R, type or paste in the text box, and press Enter. Expand the Windows Logs category, and click the System item. Click Filter Current Log either from the Actions band or the Action menu. Choose Custom range from the Logged drop-down list. Specify the earliest date and time from which you want logged events. If you're unsure about the right time, pick some value enough in the past. Select Power-Troubleshooter from the Event sources list. Type in the event ID text box, then click OK. Make sure the filtered event list is sorted by date in descending order (latest event first). Event ID is triggered every time the system awakes from either sleep or hibernation; latest event available should match the date and time when you manually resumed the system. Open the Filter Current Log dialog again. Choose Custom range again from the list. Leave the From values as is, and change the To date/time values in order to match those of the awake event you filtered earlier, plus one minute. Add Kernel-Power to the Event sources list. Type in the event ID text box, then click OK. Find the event ID which happened right before the last awake event. That should coincide, more or less, with the date and time when Windows entered the hibernation mode. 

Batch automation There are many folder types, and making the required changes by hand would be annyoing. Save the following code as (or whatever, as long it has the .cmd extension), and run it as administrator. 

Note If you want to preserve the location corresponding to the current background picture (in case it's stored in a custom path), skip this step. Open a command prompt, type or paste the following command, and press Enter: 

Get the KB2914218 update package. Extract the downloaded file using 7-Zip in a folder named after the original file (e.g. ). Open a command prompt as administrator, and navigate to the actual folder by using the following command: 

Solution If you open you will notice the disable date is reported too. Sort the services by date, and enable everything that isn't: 

In the example above I combined and : . You can search any combinations by using the logical operator. For example, to search compressed files which are either read-only or not: 

Resolution After deleting the registry key, any missing entries will be restored when switching themes. 

Laptop specifications According to the official specifications, the laptop is indeed supposed to come with Windows 7: 

If you don't want the folder content to visible at all, you need to change the Access Control List (ACL) permissions from the Security tab of the folder properties. Even if someone else were able to change the permission and see the files, he/she couldn't open them anyway. Note EFS is not fully supported on Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium editions. Further reading 

In this case the value includes three NT-based Windows versions: Windows 7 (), Windows 8 (), and Windows 8.1 (). This means the driver package is compatible with Windows 8/8.1, at least on paper; still the Policies pane isn't available in Windows 8.x. Whether the operating system or the library file is to blame, I wouldn't know. Registry functions Driver settings are usually stored in the registry, and the library does include some Windows registry functions: 

Starting with version 2.0, some causes of image invalidation (including the CPU type) have been removed. Additionally, a new switch was added to re-create invalid images. Quoting a blog entry written by David Notario (emphasis mine): 

Solution Windows file association can be either system-wide or per-user, and the latter takes precedence. You can therefore override the default behavior for files by creating a specific registry key: 

Windows 8 introduced a fourth type: Automatic Memory Dump. The main difference between them is the size: smaller dump files will get written quickly to disk and take less space; larger dump files will contain more debugging information which might be useful. Another difference is the location and the overwriting behavior. Complete/kernel dumps are written to by default, overwriting the previous file (if any). Small dumps are stored in the folder, and since each dump is given a different name, previous ones are preserved. From my limited experience, I can say small dumps alone usually have enough data to diagnose basic issues. Either way, you should disable the automatic restart option. This way you can actually see the bug check technical details in case the system fails to create a memory dump. Complete memory dump 

Results After loading hundreds of files, the cache size was bytes (about 318.65 MiB). The trim counter was set to , meaning over 300 of the oldest entries were discarded to make room for new ones. 

While different languages have different setup packages (hence different details), all of them include identical copies of the file, which has to be digitally signed by , and countersigned by ; both signatures must be valid. You can check them by opening the file properties dialog. Download links You can use any of these, or find an alternate source yourself. While the actual file name could be different, the other details provided above must match exactly. Make sure to scan the files using your antivirus, and upload a copy to VirusTotal to feel confident enough. If possible, test the program in a safe environment first. When you're done, make a backup of the executable. 

Paste the list of available suites into a blank text document. Edit the suite list as needed. When you're done, place a comma at the end of each suite name except the last one. Then remove all the line breaks in order to get a single line, and make sure there are no space characters. Press Win+R, type or paste in the text box, and press Enter. Navigate to the following registry key: 

Log on with the Guest account, and then log off. This is just to ensure the profile gets initialized, in case it's not already. Log on with an administrator account, and open an elevated command prompt. 

In earlier operating systems you would have used instead. Variable names are not case-sensitive. Create folders 

Batch script A - Update check This is the most reliable way. The script first checks if the operating system is Windows 8.1 by comparing the version with . Then all installed updates are queried to verify whether the KB2919355 update was installed already. 

Preliminary steps The proposed solution uses batch scripting and task scheduling techniques to handle all of this. Before we can actually jump to the juicy bits, we need to do a few things. Obtain the Device Console (DevCon) utility 

That version is 1.11.4, which is more than 5 years old. You can get a newer version here: $URL$ It is statically linked, which means you don't need external libraries in order to run it. 

Note The command will fail if the folder wasn't renamed, as per step 5. Repeat steps 3-6 for any other folders you want to relocate. When you're done, restart Windows. Ensure everything is working correctly, then delete the folders. 

Press Win+R, type or paste and press Enter. Uncheck the Tablet PC Components option from the list, and click OK. Restart Windows to apply the changes. 

Note Administrator rights (or enough rights to access the related registry key) are required in order to apply the changes. How it works The registry key was designed, among other things, to automatically launch a debugger when an application starts. While the debugger would start the application and attach, you can specify just any executable which will be run instead, thus overriding the original one. What about ? It's a little stub program which was first introduced with Windows 95, and used to handle the system notification icons. It's not really used any more in the newer Windows versions, and it was mostly kept for backward compatibility reasons. It has no user interface, and doesn't do anything noticeable besides refreshing the notification area when started. Remarks 

Display output Despite the fact that the graphic card supports resolutions up to 2560x1600 through the DVI (dual link) or DisplayPort interface, the laptop only provides a HDMI port and a legacy VGA port. It's logical to assume Sony didn't implement the other ports at all, thus the motherboard lacks the necessary hardware logic. If you were to use a passive HDMI to DVI dual link adapter, the entire HDMI signal would transmitted through a single link of the DVI connector, and not both. A single link DVI supports resolutions up to 1920x1200; in order to get higher resolutions you would need a powered, active solution to upscale the input signal.
