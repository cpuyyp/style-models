The hard drive manufacturer decides what SMART attributes they will expose to you. If they decide not to track or give you that information, you can't really get it. As for how you determine what attributes are available, you look at the output, just as you already did. 

First, you need to ensure that the system time is set correctly. And ensure that it stays set correctly by running the ntp daemon. Second, you need to follow the link given in the error message you posted and begin recovering the databases. 

But note that dependency management does not install the X server itself. This means that it's generally not a real problem. You won't have X running just because you installed GraphicsMagick. This permits a scenario where the X server is remote (e.g. on the developer's workstation). If this still bothers you for some reason, then you can always compile GraphicsMagick yourself, or tweak and rebuild its source RPM. 

No, that's not possible, because the new server knows nothing about the state of the previous connection. A WebSocket is not stateless like UDP or Ã˜MQ. The client must reconnect in this case. 

You already have a running program listening on port 8080, as evidenced by your output. You seem to indicate that it is Apache. You will need to reconfigure Apache so that it does not listen on port 8080, or choose a different port on which to run your Go program. 

The error message explicitly tells you that the directory needs the permission, so that should have been the first thing you tried. 

If you only wanted to give higher preference to specific IPv4 addresses or blocks, you can specify them as well. Remember that you have to use an IPv4-mapped IPv6 in hex. So, to give preference to 203.0.113.0/24 over all IPv6, you would add: 

If you take a look at the unit, you will see that it has a command to attempt to verify the Tor configuration before starting the service. 

For Windows 8, you first need to install Remote Server Administration Tools. First ensure that you have the Hyper-V management tools installed. You can do this by Add Roles and Features from Server Manager. 

If you're using libvirt, you can't do this in the virt-manager GUI, you have to edit the network XML directly, e.g. with You need to add a element to set up a TFTP server (if you don't already have one), and add a element inside the element of the configuration to tell clients about it. For example, to run a TFTP server on your host at 192.168.122.1, with files served from , and provide it to clients with a boot filename of you would change: 

This generally indicates that you edited your configuration file with an editor that replaces plain single quotes and double quotes with "smart quotes". Indeed, in your configuration file the smart quotes are visible and distinct from the other quotes: 

means that nothing is listening on that port (8983 in your case). Start the service which is supposed to listen for connections on that port. 

There's no real reason for regular users to not have these programs in their , and if having a regular user call one of these programs is an issue, then the program and/or its security need to be fixed. You'll be happy to find in RHEL 6 and higher that and are now in the default for all users, as it has been in Fedora for many years. (And is a symlink to starting from RHEL 7, but that's another issue.) 

There are a wide variety of problems that can cause NaN in Cacti graphs. The best thing to do is to work through the debugging checklist in the Cacti documentation. 

"Memory demand" means the amount of memory that the running OS and applications are trying to consume. If it's greater than the amount of memory assigned, then the VM will be paging out. From TechNet: 

You received the error because the file does not exist. The reason the file does not exist is that the file in the repo is named , while your howto has a instead of the . 

First you actually firewall off the attacker's IP address. If you didn't do that already, there's no point in discussing anything else. Second, you can look up the owner of the IP address and contact the attacker's ISP via their email address. Be prepared to provide firewall logs and other logs of their malicious activity. 

You could do this more easily with nginx's split clients module. For instance, if you want a roughly three way split: 

Note that should be set here, even if you don't use UTC as your timezone. This refers to the server's hardware clock, which should always be UTC regardless of your chosen system timezone. Replace the file with a link to the selected timezone: 

Your web site is not accessible to users who have IPv6, (about a quarter of the US and close to 10% worldwide, and growing) because your DNS records point to an IPv6 address which does not correspond to your server. 

Your tests are not on similarly configured servers. Your Apache server served all its requests with keepalives enabled, but your nginx server served all its requests with keepalives disabled, which creates a significant reduction in performance as a new TCP connection must be opened for every request. By default, nginx has keepalives enabled, so you must have explicitly disabled them somehow. Inspect your nginx configuration carefully and remove any directives related to , so that nginx uses its default behavior. Then try your benchmark again. 

This was a bug in zabbix_agentd that was fixed in 1.8.5. This will be available in wheezy. It's been proposed for squeeze-backports, though nothing has happened so far. If you can't update, you can work around it by specifically setting the directive to your exact IPv4 address, for example: 

That error means your site doesn't have a file for showing a favicon. If you don't want a favicon, you can safely ignore it. 

You are probably not using a UTF-8 locale on your system. You can temporarily work around this in your shell by setting your locale to a UTF-8 locale, for instance: 

Amazon CloudFront sends an HTTP/1.0 request to your origin server, which causes nginx to refuse to send a gzipped response (by default). Setting works around this broken behavior in CloudFront. (It's been 15 years since HTTP/1.1, anything still speaking HTTP/1.0 is fundamentally broken...) However, once you set it and reload nginx, you also need to invalidate your objects in CloudFront so that new (gzipped) copies will be fetched. 

You can set the parameter to set the error conditions when nginx will retry a request on another upstream proxy server. For example: 

The setting does not create a PID file. That is still up to the service itself to do, the same as it has been for the last 40 years. Rather, this option tells systemd where to find an existing PID file (if any). In most cases it's not required at all, as systemd will keep services in their own cgroups and does not need a PID file to keep track of them. However, systemd will delete a PID file when the service exits, if the service fails to clean up after itself. From the documentation: 

Also keep in mind that SELinux works in addition to regular UNIX permissions, so the relevant files and directories must also have the appropriate ownership and permissions, whatever they will be for your specific use case. 

With the old CPUs you're using, it seems most likely that you're CPU bound; compression eats a lot of CPU (and it can vary depending on the data being compressed) and is almost certainly the immediate cause of the issue. If you can compress with a faster CPU somehow, perhaps by piping the data to a faster machine first, then that should help. You can also try using a multi-core capable compression utility such as pbzip2, which should increase the rate of compression on your dual-core system, at least. It won't do anything for you on the single-CPU VM, though. pbzip2 writes bzip2-compatible files and is already packaged for most Linux distributions. 

It appears you have found a program which is not fully translated into your language. Try running it as: 

This is a warning, not an error. That's why it was prefaced with in the log. It means that the size of the uploaded file was larger than the in-memory buffer reserved for uploads. The directive controls the size of that buffer. If you can afford to have 1GB of RAM always reserved for the occasional file upload, then that's fine. It's a performance optimization to buffer the upload in RAM rather than in a temporary file on disk, though with such large uploads a couple of extra seconds probably doesn't matter much. If most of your uploads are small, then it's probably a waste. In the end, only you can really make the decision as to what the appropriate size is. 

Save a copy of your configuration files. RPM will do this anyway with an extension for any files you modified, but it's best to be doubly sure. Forcibly remove all of the packages: 

You have a problem with your number. In your live DNS zone the serial number is . But in your new zone it is . Serial numbers can only be incremented; a serial number lower than the previous one will be ignored, along with all the records in the zone. Whenever you change one or more records in the zone, always change the serial number to a number larger than the previous one. It is a common convention to use the date of the change along with some extra digits as the serial number, and this seems to be what was done previously: 

If all your clients are on the same account, then they will be able to access each other's data. This is obviously a very bad idea. Instead of using a single account, use a reseller account; this will let you give each client an individual account of their own; you can also bill them separately. 

The reason you don't have to escape is that is not a delimiter. It sounds like you are accustomed to writing regular expressions in other applications, where a delimiter is required. For instance, in Perl you might write something like: 

If you're using MySQL 5.1's built-in InnoDB, then index creation and removal are very slow. This was addressed in 5.5 with fast indexes. Update MySQL if possible. Alternately you can replace the built in InnoDB from 5.1 with the InnoDB Plugin (though this should have already been done; given that you're having this issue it probably somehow wasn't). 

These sorts of software licenses generally tie themselves to the MAC address of an Ethernet adapter in the server on which they're to be run. Which is annoying as hell when the NIC breaks and has to be replaced... So the NIC ID they're asking for is almost certainly the MAC address. 

Plug USB hard drive into USB port. Mount USB hard drive, e.g. at . Copy the hard drive images. For example: 

You contact your Regional Internet Registry and find out their procedure for obtaining provider-independent (portable) IP addresses. 

The trouble actually seems to be with sssd, which I learned is actually responsible for pushing the dynamic DNS updates. I cranked up debugging with and found this in the logs. It seems to indicate that sssd isn't even bothering with attempting to send an A record, though it doesn't really give me any indication why. 

The init script, and specifically the helper , expects the program it starts to put itself in the background by default. However, someone has mistakenly altered your nginx configuration to prevent it from doing this: 

Repeat for all their ASNs, if they actually have more than one. This is just a demo to show how easily the information can be obtained. You can work these into a script at your convenience. Also note that some of the returned ranges may overlap; how you deal with this is between you and your firewall. 

You have also installed the remi repositories for EL6, but you are actually running EL7. You also need to correct this by using the EL7 repos instead. The easiest way to do this is to install the appropriate remi-release RPM for EL7. 

Typically, Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros will start a service as soon as it's installed; Red Hat based distros do not. In either case it's not necessary to reboot; if the service hadn't been started automatically as part of the installation, you could have started it yourself.
