You should be able to use fdisk to add an extended partition with no trouble. I've done so a number of times in Ubuntu as well as in several other ancient distros. But I prefer the graphical program GParted. It's available as a live CD if you don't have X installed. 

I'm using Chromium (Version 30.0.1599.114 Ubuntu 12.10) under Linux. I'm trying to access a website that claims that it doesn't work under Linux. Of course, this is most likely crazy since the web is platform-independent (unless they're using some kind of evil plug-in). I've used a user agent switcher to supply a Windows user agent, but to no avail. Upon viewing the source, it appears that the site is using Javascript to determine the operating system. I'm looking for a way to get my browser to report in Javascript that it is Windows or MacOS. Do you know how to do it? 

If you build your kernel following the proper procedures for building Ubuntu kernels (I don't know what they are), then when you install the resulting packages you'll get an additional entry in the GRUB boot menu. Your old kernel(s) will still be there unless you explicitly remove them. Recovery mode isn't a special kernel. It just boots a minimal system, using whatever kernel it's paired with. 

My sole internet connection is via tethering to my Android phone (OnePlus 3). In the past, I used WiFi tethering, and all was fine. However, I've been bitten by a phone bug which results in my phone turning WiFi tethering off every 5 minutes or less. I've configured Tasker to re-enable it, but my work requires a constant connection. All this makes WiFi tethering unworkable for me until my phone gets a bugfix update. In the interim, I've been plugging my phone into my Windows 10 laptop and using USB tethering to internet. This gives me reliable internet, but it causes the situation which is the subject of this question: When I'm connected to the internet via USB, certain Windows features don't work properly: The News and Weather apps take tens of minutes to open and frequently stop responding for a minute or two at a time. The Settings app normally doesn't work at all in the networking sections, and sometimes in the other sections. The taskbar's networking icon takes tens of minutes to reflect the current network status. Older programs (such as the control panel) don't seem to be affected, and Edge mostly works. Command-line tools such as and work perfectly. What's going on? This is an issue for me because I need to tell Windows to treat my USB tethered connection as a metered connection, but the Settings app won't open when I'm using that connection--and for some reason, the network settings available from the control panel and those available through the settings app are different. 

I do not have bsdtar on my machine (it is tar in FreeBSD, as well as tar in Mac OS X 10.6 (older releases use GNU tar); it is available as bsdtar on some Linux distributions: Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, and some RPM-based distributions), but looking at the code, I am sure that invocation will just cause an “Option --strip-components is not permitted in mode -c” error. If you want this, you will probably have to roll your own program (or get someone to do it for you). Fortunately, this may not be as hard as it sounds. bsdtar is based on the very nice libarchive library. It looks like it would be fairly straightforward to make a program that does what you want. Since bsdtar already has most of the code you would need to copy one archive to another (through its handling), you could probably even do it by adding some functionality to bsdtar. An simple “damn the architecture, just get it done” approach might be to enable for mode and add a call to inside . The problem with this approach is that all the transformations would be applied to both entries from s and the pathnames of actual files specified through other means (command line args, pathname lists, etc.). This behavior may or may not in the best interest of official bsdtar (there is probably some reason is not already enabled for mode). 

You probably want the command line option (meaning “stay in foreground”; see ). You can usually incorporate it directly into your EDITOR value (or that of VISUAL, GIT_EDITOR, or Git’s , etc.): 

But since these are the default, you will need to track down where they are being changed/removed before you will know where to put the above commands to make them effective (they will need to come after whatever else is modifying the bindings). Are you sure your option is set to ? It does default to , but tmux will set it to (along with ) if you have the VISUAL environment variable set and its value has in it†, or if you do not have VISUAL set but do have EDITOR set and its value has in it. You can check your global value with . You may also have a per-window value (omit the to check its value; you may use to target another window if you can not run the command in the window itself). If you want to override the “auto-detection” and always use the binding tables, then you can put these lines in your : 

Since you can run almost all tmux commands directly from a shell (not just from a tmux prompt), you can do this: 

The problem with Control-Shift-A is that most terminal emulation programs do not send a different code for it from the one sent by Control-A, so there would be no way for screen to tell the difference. You might be able to use C-q if you do to disable “software flow control” on the tty. I usually do this so I can use C-s to search on the command line. You might consider C-^, since it seems to be usually unbound. It is Control-Shift-6 on US keyboard layouts, but it may be difficult to type on other layouts. Most people never use the tty control character C-\ to send SIGQUIT. To use it, disable the tty functionality with with and bind it as your prefix key. This is a bit risky though, since if you hit C-\ on a tty where the quit key has not been disabled with stty, you might kill the foreground process instead of activating screen. I switched to tmux a while ago. Its default is C-b because it was developed under screen and did not interfere with screen's default. I have found that C-b works fairly well for me (I usually use the arrow keys for single character movement on the shell command line—though I use M-b and M-f to move by words). Incidentally, the author of tmux uses C-a in his primary sessions and always types C-a twice (whether in a tmux session or not). If you are willing to adopt this habit, it seems like a decent compromise since the second C-a should be a no-op in most Emacs-like editing contexts. It would not work so will if you often use programs/contexts outside of screen where the second C-a would not be a no-op. By default, C-a C-a is bound to the other command (switch to most recently active screen) in screen. To have C-a C-a send an actual C-a and have C-a o switch windows, put the following in your : 

Hard to say without a few more details. I'm assuming for now that you don't have an SSD, but a mechanical spinning hard drive. The problem of the blanked app name and the sluggishness may be symptoms of the same problem. You say the problem happens when you switch application? So the system will be activating that app, and redrawing the menu bar. Does it happen more when you switch to apps you've not used in the last few minutes? That would support a diagnosis of not enough RAM. The blanking might be explained by the whole app having been swapped out of RAM, so before you can switch to it it has to reload from disk. Also the fact that logging out and in again helps also supports the not enough RAM theory because that means you are quitting all apps - and thereby reducing the competition for RAM. 10-20 seconds is a long time for this, but is possible if your hard disk is badly fragmented. While Unix filesytems are typically not too bad when it comes to fragmentation, but if your disk is fairly full and you've just changed a lot of large files (like an OS update would) then you may be seeing a bigger impact. I had a similar performance issue because my virtual memory file was split into about 20,000 pieces all over my hard drive, and defragging felt like getting a new machine! I should add a caution about defragging - only do it on spinning disks - not on SSDs. On SSDs it makes no detectable difference - but does reduce the life of the drive. So first off, let us know how much RAM you have, and second use a tool like iDefrag to see (in the first instance how badly fragmented your drive is). If it shows up as very badly fragmented then go ahead and defrag. You should backup before defragging. Life will be easier on you if you clone to an external drive rather than just using Time Machine (and make sure you can boot off the clone before you continue), and it might even be quicker to clone to an external drive and then clone back again. Defragging can take a very long time on a badly fragged disk. It took about 18hours that time my machine got sluggish! I'd suggest for lion 4GB is probably a minimum depending on what you're doing with the machine. A bit of light word-processing is not going to put as much strain on the machine as doing video editing or other media heavy tasks. If you routinely us lots of apps at the same time, you'll also need more RAM. If you have enough RAM the other possibility is that you have a program which has a memory leak, meaning it's demanding ever more RAM from the system, which will eventually mean things get pushed onto disk. You should be able to spot that in Activity Monitor - look at the Real Mem column (not the virtual men column). As a guide, on my machine here, kernel_task is using 718MB, which is the largest chunk, Thunderbird is next with 212MB. If you see an app where the Real Mem keeps going up then it might be leaking. You'll need an update for that app in that case. The other thing to look at in Activity Monitor while you're there is the Disk Activity. If that spikes a lot when you switch apps then RAM will definitely speed things up.
