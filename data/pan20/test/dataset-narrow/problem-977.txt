Note that it exists an option to delete the files from the origin that you can include in the command line, I think the one you search for is , but check it carefully. Another option you may find useful is 

You can substitute an entry in the list (e.g. the command ) with ; you can erase this entry from the list with ; you can reset the list completely with . - Synchronize data on disk with memory The command ensures everything in memory is written to disk. To speed up the operation often Linux can store some data in the kernel filesystem buffers, i.e., data which has been scheduled for writing via low-level I/O system calls[1]. On the other hands "Hard disks may default to using their own volatile write cache to buffer writes, which greatly improves performance while introducing a potential for lost writes"[2] 

Note that in this way you will leave your username and password in plain text, without any encryption or protection... 

This should not affect your actual virtual machine, even if it's possible you need to update the guest addition for them. Notes: 

that is a file not present on your HDD. To investigate errors of this kind you can add an in the line and see the output generated by your cycle: 

Fluxbox Fluxbox is a windowmanager for X that was based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. It is very light on resources and easy to handle but yet full of features to make an easy, and extremely fast, desktop experience. It is built using C++ and licensed under the MIT-License. 

On some (maybe old) Debian distribution based is used at the boot time where it is written . To make it effective you have to change there too. 

Since the colours are stored with their ansi sequence you can create a script to translate each of them... or you can use a script just made. For example it exists the script ansi2html [v0.15,v0.23] that you can make executable, put in a directory of your path (typically ) and use with 

The files that apt-get is asking are not present in that repository. If you check with a browser in / (e.g.) you do not find . Try to do 

Then you can follow the official help to substitute special characters, or better here. Try with as special char to search for. In some version of word, if you select the symbol (special character) and you press Alt+x you will get the desired Unicode value decrypted for you. Reference 

Just a shot in the dark: there is a script or a command in your that try to write on that is closed to write for that process/user. If you want to identify where it is generated the error, try to enable the debugging of the current shell: 

With no specific reference to the article that you cited I will tell you that [1] [2] and [3] are three commands used in different operative systems to compress and package files in different ways (see below for further details). In Unix you can find all even if not any more so used. The "zip" term, with the diffusion of the related programs became soon a noon and a verb [4],[5] used to say in a concise way to compress different files and folders into a unique one. 

There are many file systems that allow that e.g. you can check fusecompress or Btrf, Zfs ... The list changes in time:so you can start to search the word "compression" in the file systems list e.g. from wikipedia and select what is better for you. From btrfs page of kernel.org you can read 

Update after that the question was completely reformulated: You can use or to stop the output after the first page. 

If with one of the previous solutions the image works, it means that the image was correctly done and you can start to search for other program/options in order to convert it in a format that VirtualBox can mount. 

Backup. Backup. Backup. (Just to be sure you hear me). According with datacent [1] this is the sound of a Toshiba laptop drive with bad heads making clicking or sweeping sound on boot up. [s2]. This one [s6] instead it is not the record of a motorbike but what you risk to listen in a near future. (see note). As spotted before the clicks you are listening at the start-up are the sounds produced by the heads in the attempt to align properly. If you listen each time exactly 16 times it means that this the limit defined in its firmware. It stops because continuing it will break more quickly (or it can scratch the surface of the disk creating problems more difficult to be solved). It can be generated by a mechanical failure, incoming or just come, as well as by an inadequate power supply. It means that it is getting to be broken or is not getting enough power to fully spin up. If there are no reason to think that the cable is faulty, or not securely plugged, this lack of power can be due to the computer power supply if you recently added other devices (or substituted) and you have increased the overall request. But in a laptop this is a rare case. As alternative it can be the laptop power supply that is ending its life, rare too if compared with the average life of an HDD. The fact that this problem is becoming more frequent usually means that a bigger one or an irreparable one is approaching. If you want to be sure you can try to identify the sound of your HDD [1] [3] and the problem you are up to face giving some interpretation to the SMART[4] report [5] you provide. An HDD will not break only because the disk surface is damaged, but even because the head can be: check for example on the wikipedia page about SMART [4] which data is reported as potential indicators of imminent electromechanical failure, but remember that many of those indicators are not absolute ones. In general an increasing value spots a problem even if not reported as a red one. 

To write is the equivalent to write with no parameters at all that will bring you to your home directory. To be precise it will bring you to the directory inside of (for bash,dash...) or (for csh,tcsh...). If this directory doesn't exist or is not accessible you will receive an error. If (or ) is empty you will remain in the present directory, no error will be generated, and the (or ) value will be set to the present directory. The , variable can be useful when you want to use the previous directory as parameter for a command. E.g. You want to move, all files from the present directory to the old one: . 

or, more complex, you can put the block in a function with the out of that block but still inside the while. For the doubled options (, , that are not one of the long ones, you can recursively call the same function for each letter from ... You need a flag if you have just processed as a long option. In this case however you expose your script tp bad behaviour due to missprint (e.g. if I write -o -v -e -r -d`...) 

For a solution valid till the next reboot you can use . Probably it will not appear in your current shell because the variables are set on opening (you can fix it manually or working in a new shell). From in the section SET NAME
