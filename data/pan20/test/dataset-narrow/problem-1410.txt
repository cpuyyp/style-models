After looking through my code over and over again, I found what I did wrong: The problem was that I hadn't initialized my tile map before I was trying to get the layers of the tile map, so it gave me the exception. All I needed to do was move the tile map initialization before I found the layers. 

Just like to say that I have little experience in the lua language BUT, If you take the x y z position of your model "Freddy" and the x y z position of all your other bricks, from there you could find the distance between "Freddy" and the brick and whether the color of that brick is black or not. Then when "Freddy" is a touching distance from the brick, you can allow him to pass through it or not. Hopefully this helps. 

Besides sines and cosines (which 50-75% of programmers I've met didn't know how to use), learn the magical arc-tan function and how it can be used to get the angle of any vector. 

Apparently you need to install AIR in your mobile to use Flash apps, and AIR requires Android 2.2 while my Milestone is a feeble 2.1.update1. There is seriously no Flash lite or other alternative? 

Sure. Make non-square tiles. For 75 degrees, you want a tile that's tan(75) = 3.732 times as tall as it is wide. (edit: You might want to use shorter tiles on the 'middle' area between ground and roof, so as to enable buildings of various heights.) 

Now you can already see how that this is beginning to look like a board! I've never played the variant mentioned in the youtube video but it appears to start with 2 rows of white pieces one row from the bottom, and 2 rows of black pieces one row from the top. Which would mean when we start a game our array should look like this: 

Users 1 through 8 all create 50 units Each user commands all of their units to move to a location on the map Units attack each other etc. 

(Remember 2 represents 'BLACK_PIECE' and 1 represents 'WHITE_PIECE') So now the computer has a structure to work with. Step 1 complete! 

In my general experience, this is what companies will allocate, based on how much profit they expect to make: 

Badweasel correctly pointed out that this solution would require excessive resources for little effect, but you have asked for what security issues remain on your solution. Let's look at the typical avenues for cheating, more or less by order of difficulty: 

From here it's a matter of studying AI algorithms, discovering which ones work best for your specific game, and implementing the math in code. A more indepth look at all the steps of AI programming for games can be found at Programming Game AI by Example, by Mat Buckland ($URL$ 

A Few Words On Implementation Checkers is what is referred to as a 'solved' game, in that we can calculate every move with no unknowns. But that's a whole whack of moves! So there is no way to do it all manually... if only there was some... oh right we're programmers. fist pump SQL is a wonderful tool for storing all these seemingly endless moves. For those with no experience with SQL, mySQL is a free (fairly easy to use) and open source SQL server. SQL is used for managing databases, sorta like a spreadsheet on steroids. It is also able to hold seriously large amounts of data and work with it very quickly. So how can we use this? Since we know that if the board is in an exact state (each piece in a certain position) we can calculate all the available moves, and save them. For example: 

I'm not accounting for air friction here or other physics engine shenanigans, so you might need to test various constant values to see if you get the right distance and height. 

Hello and welcome to "Linear Acceleration and You: How To Use Math To Throw An Object The Right Way". Assuming an initial horizontal speed of s (in distance per time unit), a jump speed of j (distance per time unit), maximum jump height of h (distance) and gravity of g (distance per time unit squared). Time to reach maximum jump height is t (time units). Your basic jump will take t = j/g time units to reach the top of the jump, and 2j/g from start to end. Therefore, it should cover a horizontal distance of d = s*(2j/g). The maximum jump height, using the basic equation for linear acceleration you learned in Physics 101, is h = g/2 * t² = g/2 * (j/g)² = g/2*j²/g² = j²/2g. And now we have a two-equation system: 

The problem is, is that when I try to get a certain layer from the tile map, it return a null pointer error like so: 

I've been working on an simple RPG game and I'm having troubles figuring out how my graphics should look. I'm wondering if any of you could give some advice on how they are/could be more pleasing to the eye. Here is a couple of screen shots of the game itself: 

I have tried various ways of getting the layer but none of them seem to work. Here's an image of my tile map in the Tiled map editor: 

If you want to make a worldwide grid, I suggest you divide the planet in countries or continents, and make a square grid properly centered on each. Let the ocean cover the seams. 

I will ask you to reconsider your position. Drawing the same art ten times just so it's not 'blurry' will force you to either spend a lot (and I mean a lot) of time on the art or rush it and have the same issue with quality. What if you have to redraw an asset? More common strategies to deal with this issue are: 

And voila. j is directly proportional to s, and g is directly proportional to the square of s. Going back to code: 

This is a little late, but... This is an example from c++, written by me, but you could probably take it and write it out in unity. You could take a random number using the rand() or any other random function. Then take that number, and as you place down each tile upon the map, use that number to determine what type of ocean tile it is going to be. 

While following a tutorial with LibGDX, I am working with tile maps. This is the method that I'm using: 

This may, or may not, be the correct answer for you, BUT In your code, when you draw the platforms images to the screen, you add the camera's position to their x/y positions. This would not be necessary because you would then have problems with colliding, because your adding the cameras scroll to it so you wouldn't see them in their colliding positions. If you wanted to keep that, then I would suggest adding the camera x/y to the collision section. Hope this helps. 

Five terms. h and d are constant, and we want to know j and g based on a variation of s. Let's use one of these equations to define j in terms of g. 

It really depends on what you're trying to render. For example, if you're rendering layers of clouds that are transparent to the background but not necessarily to each other, one useful trick is to draw the background, then non-transparent cloud layers, then draw the background again at 50% transparency over the other layers. 

If the concern is for speed running, you can measure how far the player is from the puzzle "entrance" by the time they first see a part of the puzzle, calculate how long it will take to reach the puzzle entrance at top speed, and rewind the puzzle state by that many seconds. Most games just make periodic events happen often enough that you're unlikely to miss one by too long. If you're making a game for speedrunners, you should allow for some creativity when navigating sections anyway.
