There are a number of mail servers that are being used out there (Postfix, qmail, sendmail, etc. See $URL$ for a list of them). You want to do some research into the various ones out there and pick the right one for you as their feature sets and complexity will likely play a part in which server is right for you. Postfix seems to be a very popular choice, often coming pre-installed with many distros. After having chosen one, you need to do some reading on your server of choice. You'll have to learn the various configuration options out there and choose ones that are best suited for your situation. The following mail gives you some idea to configure Mail server $URL$ 

You can find the all available sessions by using MessAdmin. Its a default tool with Jboss Application Server for administrator's help.Example for accessing Mess Admin shown below $URL$ 

Basically this is a bug in MySQL that causes the problem but a work around is simple. The problem happens when the Auto-Increment value of a table grows beyond the limit. Just run this SQL query in MySQL to fix the bug. ALTER TABLE AUTO_INCREMENT =1 Table_name is the name of the table where you found the error while inserting data into. Donâ€™t bother about the Auto_Increment value even if you have records in your table.

I would like to implement some sort of contact database management system within a small company. At this point I have roughly 200 contacts but I see a prospecting database could grow over 500 but probably not more than 1000. I would like contacts to be organized in some containing database. Within the container database there are organizational groups. A contact may belong to more than one group. I would like contacts to be searched and sorted by things such as name, company, organizational group, etc. I would like the ability to do mail merge, both email and snail mail. When sending emails, I would only like each recipient to see only his or her own email address, even if the email was sent to a distribution list with many emails on it. Is this possible? 

Lately I have been getting an increasing number of complaints regarding users not being able to download attachments synced from Exchange with their iPhone. The iPhones in question are either 3G or 3GS with firmware 3.0 or later. Exchange 2003. The majority of messages come in just fine. Some however display: "This message has not been downloaded from the server" where the email's text normally should be. At the bottom of the email, it states: "This message is only partially downloaded." It has a button labeled "Download remaining 0 bytes." If you click this button, it states that it is loading and then reverts to the same screen. The odd part is that this only affects some emails. Most come in fine with attachments working. I've taken the same email that was not working on my iPhone. Sent it to a gmail account that my iPhone had access to. The message and attachment opened fine. Any ideas of possible causes I could look into? Thanks. EDIT: The same occurs on 4.0 + 

well everyone knows that 'root' (the username) is the admin of your box, so by denying 'root' remote access to ssh into your box you are making it just a wee bit harder for the hackers to get into your box since now they will have to guess a username on your box. 

Yes it could be the reason.I think Your Mysql Data directory is in the /var.You please open your my.cnf(may be you can find it in /etc directory) file and check whether the data directory in /var or not. I think so much space is available in /Home directory and you can use it as your mysql data directory. 

With this line root cannot ssh into the box. To become root, ssh in as a normal user then use su - to become root once logged in.

Exchange 2010 server. Outlook 2007 clients. I have Outlook Anywhere enabled on the server. If I have a laptop connected to an outside internet connection not on our corporate LAN and manually configure Outlook Anywhere, it works and I am able to connect to our Exchange server. As soon as the laptop is brought into our network / domain, the incorrect Outlook Anywhere settings are pushed from the server to the client and Outlook Anywhere breaks. Here are what the working settings look like: 

I am currently using Microsoft Exchange 2003 on Windows Server 2003 with various iPhone 3G, 3GS, and 4s. The iPhones have all been upgraded to the latest firmware. Users are using Outlook 2007. An example I am finding is that normal calendar events added from either Outlook or iPhone sync fine but if I am the "meeting organizer" sending a "meeting request" the event will show in my Outlook but not on my iPhone. Is there any good list of Exchange/iPhone ActiveSync limitations? Any workaround for the issue above? Thanks. 

I started working for a medium sized company (approx. 150 users). When user's workstations need to be reformatted for any variety of reasons, we reformat, reinstall windows from an oem disk, install drivers, install shop desired software, and restore user's documents from latest backup. While the process isn't very difficult it is very time consuming. What are some options to simplify / speed up this process? Mostly a complete Windows shop with most servers running Win2k3 Enterprise and workstations running a variety of XP, Vista, and 7. Workstations are purchased through a variety of OEMs mostly Dell. 

I just started working for a small-medium size company doing IT support. Maybe 150 or less users. Right now every user has administrative rights to their own machine. This allows them to install updates or whatever else they would like to. I'm tired of getting on user's machines that are bloated with crap they put on themselves. So my first thought would be to take away administrative rights to their computer. This would also have other advantages such as preventing a lot of drive-by malware on the web etc. The problem arises that users are unable to install updates. (Even though I find most ignore these anyway) How do large companies handle software updates on all client machines? EDIT: Windows environment. Most servers are Windows Server 2003 Enterprise. Clients are all Windows. Win XP, Vista, and 7.
