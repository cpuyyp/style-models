I am trying to setup a load balancer behind my ASA 5515. (Running Cisco IOS version 9.1.) Is it possible to group the ports to do a static nat, with a service-group statement? For instance, I want to be able to NAT ports 80 and 443 (and other ports). My service group: 

I am trying to setup a site to site VPN tunnel, between two networks, one with a Sophos UTM, the other a Cisco 5515X. The ASA side of the tunnel is configured with a public peer, private address subnet (192.168.71.0) while the Sophos side is compelled to use the same IP address as tunnel peer and host (3.3.3.50 - this is a fake address.) Tunnel is up, I can see traffic passing through it from the Sophos UTM's network, but there is nothing coming back out from the Cisco side. This is my first time having to configure an ASA for this, and I am completely stumped. Please can someone tell me what I am missing? My Cisco ASA configuration is below. 

In theory is possible to use link-local IPv6 as gateway address, but IPv6 link-local accessible only from local subnet (it nonroutable), so then how to access equipment for management over IPv6 form other subnets? 

Logicaly, this make same result. Wireles controller usually configure APs for desired SSIDs, frequency, VLANs etc. 

If You don't have public IPv4 on the server and can't get IPv6 from ISP, then You can get IPv6 for Your LAN from IPv6 tunnel broker (search any working) 

If You "like" cheap unmanaged switches, You can use separate unmanaged switches for users and cameras. And connect NAS and switches to different ports of router. But unmanaged switches for untrusted users can be bad idea anyway. Look at cheap more or less managed switches like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti if You need PoE. Without managed switch or using separate unmanaged switch per isolation group only fake isolation posible. By assign multiple subnets on single router port. And only in one dynamic DHCP possible. It can depend on router features. What is Your router? 

It's indeed possible to configure this - nevertheless there's a "trick" called "MAC spoofing" in which someone fakes a MAC-Address - and this can easily be done. There's a standard called 802.1X (RADIUS) which will fit your needs. Nevertheless, for that you need a supplicant software (A supplicant (PC, Tablet, ..) has the data stored in order to be able to authenticate itself on the RADIUS-server (authentication-server)) which is not configured natively on every device such as printers. (Maybe your printers have a supplicant software or are able to install it) For those you would have to use MAC-Bypass (Which will authenticate a device by its MAC). Unfortunately this would create the same problem as stated above - but for fewer devices. 

AP can handle multiple SSID and bridge it to different VLANs to separate traffic of SSIDs. And router handle different VLANs with correct rules. AP can make some kind of L2 tunnel to central device (wireless controller or roouter). 

Cat7 socket exists. $URL$ Cat7 required to make 10 Gigabit Ethernet over 100 m of copper cabling If You really need to achieve this, socket category and proper grounding is important. 10GBASE-T, or IEEE 802.3an-2006 ... Category 6a is required to reach the full distance of 100 metres (330 ft) and category 6 may reach a distance of 55 metres (180 ft) For 1000BASE-T Cat5 is enough. 

On the switch I configured two ports: f0/5 for the router, and f0/6 for the external network cable with: 

Fixed. Apparently I am not supposed to add the VIP to the network the mgmt1 interface is on. Had to use the dsr method in order to get the load balancing to function. Can't complain but I would have like to do it without dsr (having to create loopback interfaces on the real servers, with the VIP's address). 

Weird. We just got a Brocade ADX 1000 for server load balancing. Config is setup to emulate the basic load balancer configuration in their guide (real servers, VIP and management IP are all members of the same subnet). Yet we can't ping or reach the VIP at all, with Layer 3. We can arping it to know that it's there. Is this restricted by licensing (just found out the licenses are circa 2013 and 2014) or is there something wrong with our configuration? I would be grateful for any pointers. Our basic configuration: 

How many devices need to be connected? If not too, crazy solution to connect network cards directly by patch-cord. But PTP require ultra low jitter, rather latency time. What with network adapter buffers. 

bandwidth or throughput is / where implied - data is received by destination and frequently implied - data is application data (at least L2 or upper) All protocol overhead count there. transmission rate or bitrate is similar, but data just transmitted but no warranty on receiving by destination. And it not count protocol overhead. It L1 speed. 

It depends on l2tp setup. If it use BCP (Bridge Control Protocol) PPP extension, then l2tp works like Ethernet (forward L2 frames), so your first assumption is right. If it plain l2tp (which forward L3 packets only) it forwarded by routes or by combination of routes and arp manipulation (Arp Proxy or some other), then your second assumption is right. 

Could the reason be, that the emulated IOS in Packet Tracer doesn't know this command configured that way, because it's not up-to-date? 

As @ar_ pointed out in the comments of my question: The problem was, that I configured the network command in a wrong way. So I used subnetmasks instead of wildcard masks. (network-commands in OSPF need wildcard masks). @RonMaupin added the information in the comments of this answer, that in the newest IOS-version both ways (subnetmask and wildcardmasks) work. 

Shure, they have to be connected directly do each other, but in configuration you just configure for which interface the virtual router should exist. 

Sorry for the newb question, I am trying to figure out how to best link up an subinterface on a Cisco 1921 router, with an external network, by connecting the router and the cable from the external network, to a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch and isolating them into their own VLAN. The external network recommended I use a 172.A.A.102 255.255.252 for my router IP, and ping 172.A.A.101 on their network. I was able to ping successfully by connecting the external network's cable to my laptop and configuring their IP information, but I cant ping from my router after what I setup: 

To survive VPN server IP change, on Pi use dns name to connect rather IP. Buy domain, or use some free domain (many dynamic dns there, but hard to advice). (Personally I as Mikrotik consultant, prefer cheap USB powered RB. Prise is comparable to Pi. But Pi more flexible and it Your choose.) 

I can decide - problem most probable in routing from A to C (on A node) Checking routing tables Im found incorrect route to BC network. 

In practice. If operator deliver SMS only over GSM network, but not over 3G network and support 3G for data transfer. Some 3G phones connect only by "better" 3G protocol and cant recieve sms quickly. Until it switch to lover protocol because of low signal or no 3G coverage. Possible it related with operator network misconfiguration or bug in phone software or both in combination. 

The mistake was, that I configured the same router-id on both R1 and R2 and that doesn't work! Two routers can have the same touter-id but not while having the same neighbor! A router cannot "do OSPF" by being connected with two router having the same router-id! Nevertheless, as @Karl pointed out, having the same router-id configured on two or more routers is always a problem due to the LSAs which have the router-id of the advertising router included. In addition to that, more problems can occure. But still, PC1, which is connected to R1, cannot ping the ABR...
