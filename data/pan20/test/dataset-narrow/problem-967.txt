I can't say 100% yes or no, but there are some things you may be able to investigate to increase your confidence either way.... What is the maximum output resolution on the mini-display port. Graphics cards have seperate 'heads'. If the maximum display resolution on the head is 2x the monitor resolutions you are using, you can probably use a splitter. If not, probably not. 

You should notice that the hiberfil.sys is the same size as the RAM you have installed in the machine. 

If your Graphics Card (GPU) can output a signal at 1080p, then you can output this to your TV. If your graphics card is only capable of outputting a signal at 720p then you will be unable to send a 1080p signal to your TV. However saying that, some TV's will 'upscale' a 720p signal to 1080p but I'm sceptical that this has any meaningful benifit... 

Unfortunately (due to some dumb actions by Apple), this is no longer a simple process to do. Until 10.8 this was a ridiculously simple undertaking, but now it's quite an annoyance. remember this URL--> you'll need it later: $URL$ You'll need to follow these steps to download software, then you can configure it to feed the flickr url into your Mac. $URL$ 

*these may not work well with missing partitions. You'll most likely need to buy one of these (I don't know what end-user pricing is, but on a pro level, most run $200+), and then run it. Oh, and don't plug your drive in again or turn it on, until you have one of the apps to work on recovery. You're just as likely to bugger it as to fix it. Or you could find a company who does this and get it to them. it's not going to be cheap/free, unless you REALLY get lucky. that's one of the breaks of jacking around with partitions and directories... For what you've described, I'd try DiskDrill... 

I don't understand how / why this will not work, I have a un-powered USB hub which works with all three computers and the two peripherals connected. The keyboard is a DELL KB212-B and Mouse is a classic Microsoft White 5 Button Optical USB InteliMouse. The USB portion of a KVM should be a hub and the parent USB connection gets disconnected and reconnected to the other parent USB port when the switch is pressed? The StarTech manual says to change the following BIOS options, which do not exist in a DELL BIOS : 

It could be that the graphics card does not support analogue output. With DVI you can have an analog or a digital signal. With analogue a basic adaptor can convert DVI -> VGA, but if the signal is digital you need an 'active' adaptor. Active adaptors have to convert Digital to Analog so require additional power and are more expensive. I think you may need an active DVI -> VGA adaptor. 

first, if you've just deleted it, chances are the file is still on your hard drive. you need to IMMEDIATELY do a check for Unerase of recently deleted files. And DO NOT SAVE ANYTHING NEW TO THIS DRIVE!!! "Deleted" files aren't actually deleted.. The drive directory has simply been modified to remove their 'location' tabs, and the associated space is now free for use again.. So as soon as you save another file, it may overwrite that area, at which point your chances of getting those files back decrease exponentially. Using a high quality app like FileSalvage or DiskDrill, you can unerase those drives.. howevr, you can't install it on that drive (due to the fact that installation or running that drive may well overwrite the files)... SO. you need to NOT run that machine; shut it down and boot it only in Target Disk mode, then do a recovery from another machine.. This takes time, but it's one of the consequences of deleting something that you needed. If you have a TimeMachine drive, you can probably go to that drive and recover it via Time Machine. 

To create 3D PDF's you need a PDF Printer which supports this, I haven't seen a free piece of software to do this, but there may be one. Try these - 

I want to view the USB bandwidth usage of different devices on my Windows 10 laptop (1607). I found this article from Microsoft which advises to check in Device Manager, however the Advanced tab doesn't exist when I look at the properties of my USB Host Controller. The controller name is "Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)" so I thought I might need a less generic driver from Intel. But when I check the Intel site I can only find USB 3.0 drivers for Windows 7 and below. Is there a way on Windows 10 to view the USB bandwidth usage of individual devices? 

You do have a backup of it already, don't you? Hard drives are NOT reliable. Having only a single copy is not smart. Having only a single backup is only marginally better.. You need at least 3 copies to be relatively secure in data. (unless of course it's data you can afford to be without). 

one of my businesses does a lot of customized Mac work, and we upgrade 50-60 Macs per week. Primarily SSD and SSHD drives, ram, stripping Mac OSs down for best performance, etc. We've NEVER ONCE had any issue with any Samsung SSD with TRIM. not a single time. nada... The gained performance is noticeable as well.. pretty powerful. I wouldn't give it a second thought.... we install it on every SSD. 

I have a StarTech SV231 USB 2-Port KVM switch. I can't get it to connect and work with two different computers... I have three computers I have tested it with and it only works with 1 of them. (Yes the KVM is plugged in and powered...) 

I have just tested this on my system and the per app volume setting persisted between closing iTunes and opening it. I have not tried with a reboot, maybe this resets the per-app settings? 

You use SUMIF(range,criteria,sum_range), if you do not want to manually enter all of the possible criteria you can use in combination with a H or VLOOKUP(). This is my preference for something like this, easier to adjust and can format your output differently to a pivot table. SUMIF() Reference 

you have probably damaged the partition of the drive. This is why you don't want to play around in Disk Utility, unless you REALLY know what you're doing. 

Basically, ANY change you make (other than perhaps doing a drive verification) is risking a full erasure of a drive. I work on drives for a living, and I don't play with them unless I've got a full backup. 

A DHCP request is specifically a 2 way process: the client machine sends out its MAC ID in the DHCP Discovery process. So no, you can't do a conventional DHCP connection without handing out a MAC ID. The discovery packet set contains the CHADDR, whic is set to the MAC address used by the client. It is theoretically possible to spoof a different MAC ID, if you do not want to use your actual chipset's MAC ID $URL$ Note that this is generally frowned upon, and may violate policies or laws, depending on where you live & work..... 

I have a lab setup on Hyper-V 2016. It was a few servers and two Domain Controllers. I had some issues with the host and noticed that my vm's rebooted randomly with a message unable to connect to VM Storage. The storage was a storage group with 2 1TB HDD's and 4 256 SSD's. I assumed that the Disk IO was just too much and caused the issue so to remove some of the IO load, i removed all the snapshots. (Big Mistake!) I connect to the lab today and both domain controllers are unbootable, looks like they ungracefully shutdown during a windows update - the bit preboot. Tried a couple of reboots, a fix about deleting pending.xml but can't get either of them to boot. Is there anyway to recover a domain controller with no backup, just with access to the hard disk? 

your fatal error was to modify the partition with Gparted. Shoulda done that with DIsk Utility (click on that partition, and click the "-" at bottom of screen, then modified the Mac partition).... considering the partition size and HDD size, I'd VERY MUCH recommend investing in a USB drive or thunderbolt drive, doing a timemachine backup, then partition the drive again and then reinstalling the OS and doing a recovery from timemachine to it. 

/Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.Acrobat.Pro_x86_9.0.plist (or find the one comparable to your version) it's a .plist which contains (among other things) the recent files list.. it can be modified (if you've got correct permissions set), via terminal, or textwrangler, plist edit pro, or various other plist editors...
