Which should give you a little help in setting up exactly what logfiles you wish to parse. In addition there's this corresponding entry, that details the "TO" and "FROM" dates: 

Second time I've come across this question, and didn't see what I assumed might be a good answer for you, so lemme toss this out: How about an ftp site, (benefit of being OS independent, can be internal, etc.) Then you could lock down each student's folders/files in exactly that method? EDIT: Should you consider that solution, here's two links that might help you out: FTP mini how-to How to limit access to a ftp site in Windows Server 2003 SECOND EDIT, (I think this might be what you're looking for) How to set up a `blind-drop' ftp site 

Windows 2003 native mode. One domain controller on-site, read-write, no RODCs. DNS is running on the DC onsite. Servers would be pointing to the DC for DNS and authentication. How long would the child domain remain functional without it's ability to contact the forest level domain controllers? Could users still log in, up to several weeks after the disconnect, or would they experience Kerberos authentication issues? 

They're far and few between, but they're out there. Trust me. And learn, baby, learn. Attach yourself to him or her, watch for the little stuff. How do they set up their workflow? What processes do they use? What command aliases do they use? Any that you can adapt for your use? 

Dude, I just thought of this after posting. Maybe this will help a little more, since most of the links to, "Here's how Bob did his config, and here's how Jerry did his here, which is nice and all, etc." are no longer valid. In the hopes that it can help you out a little more, here's my analog.cfg file: 

Two suggestions: 1.) Make sure that ANY local volume shadow copies you're taking, are turned off. We've had QUITE a bit of conflicting information from Symantec regarding running local VSC, but have found that when we talked to the techs, they've all advised we don't run VSC on the same server. 2.) If you absolutely, positively have to run VSC, (like, there's a group of users who love deleting things and making you restore them via VSC and they're holding your family hostage or something) you could try resetting the entire kit-and-caboodle by using "vssadmin" to delete all current present volume shadow copies, then delete them. In addition to the above, have you presented/removed a disk, (such as from a SAN via fiberchannel, etc?) recently? Make sure it's no longer present in your system, and that you haven't inadvertently attempted to take a volume shadow copy snapshot of it. Along the same side of the coin, you may have "stale" volume shadow copy snapshots present for disks that are no longer there. That could be exacerbating your issue. Suggest same above, to delete those, since I believe that vssadmin is the only way you can see some of them. Don't quote me on this, but I think that you also have to expand the default size of the VSC from 300 to 500, however I'm not entirely sure. I do remember that it took me quite a bit of googling though and in the end, this made Symantec happy. Sorry, ordinarily I'd be more clear and try to give some steps but I can't seem to find where I documented this, the last time it worked and the primary backup guy is out for the day, (only other guy who'd have them in his email.) Good luck! 

Suggestions: 1.) Try commenting out/removing the "guest ok" statement. 2.) Try removing/tweaking the veto files statement, (for no other reason that I've had some issues with that myself.) Actually, here's a working line from one of my smb.conf's, (several users on that machine, all co-workers of each other.) [username] comment = Username home share path = /home/username writeable = yes invalid users = None valid users = username, co-worker1, co-worker2, co-worker3, co-worker4 veto files = /.ra/.ram/.wmv/.avi/.mpg/.mpeg/.mp3/.oog/.wav/.mid/.aac/.mov/*.wma/ browseable = yes Maybe that will help? 

"See, imagine a giant tree with a bunch of buckets on the limbs. Inside these buckets are little keys that grant you access to special doors that live in an area, past the tree. If your name matches a name etched on one of those keys in one of those buckets, you get to open the door that matches that key and access the special information that's stored in there." And my job, as an active directory administrator, is to make sure that all those buckets, keys and names etched on each are all up-to-date, working well, removed when no longer useful or needed. In addition, I build NEW doors that protect NEW rooms, mill the new keys that allow access and even water and grow the tree that holds all of it together." (Technically, I liked Evan's answer better, but this is how I'd explain it. :) 

Sorry, that last little bit in there is if you've got reportmagic installed and running as well. If you don't, I HIGHLY recomend it. Makes analog pretty, impresses management. Mmm, Mmmm good. Like soup or something. :) That being said, I'm going to guess that you're wanting to restrict analyzing to a week because it's taking forever for analog to parse your logs. (This is a totally random guess, and colored by my opinion, because I sorta/kinda saw the same thing when initially setting it up :) Be advised, once you parse a set of logfiles, (say a few days worth, or a week's worth) it may take a while, however re-running analog to examine any following logfiles is extremely quick. To summarize; create a scheduled task for analog to run once a day and it while the initial run will take some time, each successive run will be much faster than the first. HTH, mate... 

I think you're on the right path thinking DNS and Igal's asking some good questions. Check the local hosts logs for RPC errors, if you suspect NetBIOS, try at command prompt: 

1.) Most fun naming convention for me, mathematicians and physicists. The list of notable ones is almost endless and they're pretty distinctive, "Dirac", "Fermi", "Pauli", "Feynman", etc. 2.) Here's one that might work for you: First character: W, S or L, (Workstation, Server or Laptop) Second string: office/branch accounting code such as 047, 130, 227, etc. Third string: OS designator, (RHL, SUN, XP, VI, 2K, 2K3) Fourth: (here's where it splits and gets weird.) If it's a server, then a VERY short purpose code. (For application servers: "app01", etc. DNS, mail, file, etc. If it's a workstation, then put in the last four digits of the user's extension. So we've got: Sun Solaris application server, located in Dillion, Colorado which uses the office accounting code "244": s244sunapp01 Windows XP laptop, assigned to marketing personnel located in Anchorage, AL (office code 047) at extension x4556: L047xp4556 Windows 2003 domain controller, located in Bellingham, WA (office code 012): s0122k3dc01 ...and so on, and so on. Worst naming convention I ever saw used was truncating the username in a workstation name, which led to ALL SORTS of weirdness. 

I would highly suggest checking the System, App and Security logs on the local 2K3 server, (provided it's your DC as well?) If it's NOT your DC, check on the local machines to see what DC they're authenticating against. Check the logs on the local machines too, that could shed some light on the issue. Were there any changes made on either the domain, or the local network the night previous? Any remote software deployed via central location such as Altiris, etc? Off the bat, not knowing your network I'd suggest that someone or something changed on your domain and possibly didn't fully replicate to your office there.. Or, went wrong entirely. Also, check replication, global catalog status, etc. If reboots are "bringing them back", it sounds like it might just be a case where your machines can't find the DC to authenticate against, etc.. Any more info or details about the domain/network setup you can share? 

(WTF? `Performing System Maintenance'? What system maintenance would that be, little service account?) The domain service account, (mydomain/altiris-server-account) is local admin on the box, and running the following Altiris services: Altiris Client Message Dispatcher Altiris Client Task Data Loader Altiris Deployment Server Data Manager Altiris Deployment Server DB Management Altiris eXpress Server Altiris NS Receiver Altiris Object Host Service Altiris PXE Manager Altiris Service ...as well as the following SQL services: MSSQLSERVER SQLSERVERAGENT I'm completely stymied. No scheduled tasks are performing any obvious reboots, nothing shows in displaying "at" on the local box.. Nothing else appears to be scheduled in an application, other than some Altiris stuff. 

I mean, it's being awfully nice about it and all. Each and every time it seems like it's a graceful shutdown. Windows 2003 R2 server. (SP2) HP Proliant DL380 G4. (BIOS current as of 2007.) Xeon dual-core proc (3.2 G) 4 GB RAM. Running: * Altiris NS and management server * SQL Server 2000 SE (SP4) * IIS According to the security and system log, a domain service account with local admin privs is rebooting the box, with this entry in the log. (It even gives a reason, that nice little account! :) (And not only that, but the only other account that's logged in/connected happens to.. ahem, be my admin account.) 

Reading your comment you say that your clients can't see the domain controller, that's a HUGE problem there. They need to be able to see it. Check your SRV records in DNS, and/or on the local node check what the machine/logon sees as the DC. (You can do that by opening a command prompt, typing "set" and dumping the env variables and looking for something that looks like this: 

Yes, "We" can see what you're doing, long story short. Here, we use Altiris to enable Helpdesk to administer your machine from afar, as well as perform application metering, maintaining configuration standards in the guise of rapid image deployment. On our network and in our company, Skype is a banned application. If you install it, thanks to app metering, we'll know within 24/48 hours. Altiris also comes with a remote control function that can be hidden from the logged-on user. (At least the taskbar display icon, etc.) If the bosses-that-be decide you need to be monitored, after our system emails us that you've installed Skype, then we'll do so. Remember that "Use of electronic company equipment constitutes consent to monitoring", etc, blah, blah? Maybe it was worded differently in your company. Either way, I'll bet you a can of soda pop that your sr. IT, HR and Legal management have agreed on this policy. Let's say that you install Skype anyway and we don't catch it for a while. I'm still a pretty good network admin though, I'll probably catch the traffic from it on one of my wireshark or LanHound monitoring laptops. Or, you could just whip out your cell phone and call whomever it is you want to talk to, completely independent of your work-network. At that point, all you need to worry about is the NSA. :) And you're not doing anything wrong, right? 

Let's try the easy ones first: (In Internet Explorer; and I'm assuming you're using IE because you're running IIS on 127.0.0.1 and you reference the hosts file in \drivers\etc.) 

A very quick and dirty method/suggestion: Set each suspected account's password to expire and require reset upon next login. Place an asterisk in the description field of each account. Wait a week or so, re-check your flagged accounts to see which ones still need the password reset. Disable the offenders, wait for helpdesk calls, re-enable the ones that were on vacation. Another one: Alternately you could also send a list of suspected users to your HR/personnel department and see if any of them will verify that they are in fact, still employed. One more: Finally, I believe that if you open "Active Directory Users and Computers" and expand the AD Query tool, you can create a query that details what you're looking for. 

Event Type: Information Event Source: Application Popup Event Category: None Event ID: 26 Date: 6/3/2009 Time: 11:34:48 AM User: N/A Computer: altiris-server Description: Application popup: System Shutdown : The system is shutting down. Please save all work in progress and log off. Any unsaved changes will be lost. This shutdown was initiated by mydomain\altiris-server-account. Shutdown will begin in 1 seconds. Shutdown message: Performing System Maintenance. 

With those, you can likely derive what you need. I'd hazard an educated guess that your answer lays within the "FROM" and "TO" .cfg entries. As one more alternative, you could always skip those above and simply write a batch script that will move/archive or delete the previous week of logfiles -out_ of the default "\LogFiles\W3SVC1" location to say, something like "D:\IIS-Logfiles-Archive", and then run the analog analyzer for the day. Some pseudocode that might help you get started and moving in the right direction would be: (and again, this is PSEUDO-code. Rough, ugly and fits like a wet wool sweater. There probably isn't a need to delete the directory, but I'm cribbing from another script that I use, mmmkay? :) 

I think you get the gist of where this is going. To summarize, if my workday consists of training co-workers and subordinates, passing on knowledge, doing a daily log check and focusing PRIMARILY on strategic IT initiatives such as security, tools to make the user's life easier and making the network run.. Oh, I dunno, faster or better or something, then I am "doing well", I suppose. Eh, kinda rambling, but I warned you in the beginning. :) 

Oh, also.. Be forewarned, if you're using AD-integrated dynamic DNS, where your machines automatically update themselves in your DC's, once you kick down that lease time, you're going to need to compensate by scavenging those DNS entries. Maybe you could append that line up there and add, "&& ipconfig /registerdns" HTH.. 

Here's one of my favorites. We've got 700+ users and various divisions and subgroups that require their own drives. We're mapping based on username currently: 

Prior to forcing master browser, (I'm not 100% behind the idea that's the problem, but you know your network best) check it first with the support tools "browstat" 

[An extra added benefit is that since you're working with one mesh account, you can add a bunch of devices and replicate the folders between them. Let's say you've got 3 or 4 execs, if they want, you can have "John Brown's" folder replicate to "Jane Smith's" desktop and vice-versa, or everyone's folder replicated to "Mister President and CEO's" desktop.] Here's the link. Again, it's beta but might be a good interim solution, etc. 

Another suggestion, (although it's a little risky/beta right now) I've been experimenting with Windows Live Mesh. It's got 5Gb of storage for free and I could see a setup of something like this: 

Some links that may help: Saving data from broken opensuse partition Here's a pdf that could be good. and, a ubuntu forum post that has a lot of links inside that might point you in the right direction. HTH.. 

Here's an add-on that might help: "Open in browser" And here's a KB article that also might help, "MimeTypes" 

There's a few ways to do this; 1.) DFS folder replication will work, there's a tutorial here and here's the MS webpage. 2.) Robocopy in mirroring mode will work as well, but it won't key off the fact that a file has changed. Here's a script that I shamelessly copied from somewhere, (why re-invent the wheel, eh? :) that I used when migrating large amounts of data from one share to another. (A big bonus with this is that it will do incremental mirroring, i.e. run it once to replicate, then run it again and it will only copy over the files that have changed. Script is: 

Ah. After much gnashing of teeth and troubleshooting, it appeared that during a maintenance period when I ran a remote, "psshutdown" command on the server, it somehow held on to the temporary service that psshutdown creates and kept re-running it over and over. What confused me was the fact that when I would shut down for the day, it roughly corresponded to shutdown times on the server. Weird. Anyway, thanks to all for great answers, much appreciated.. 

If you're good on the above, a too-deep file/folder path might be giving you some grief. Try navigating several folders towards the root, then cutting and pasting them to reduce some of that path. Alternately, you could rename the folders in the path to "1", "2", "3", etc. Cutting down on some of the extraneous characters.
