What is known about complexity of NP-hard problems on Cayley graphs? Suppose that the graph is given explicitly as the multiplication table of the group and the list of generators. So the input length is the size of the graph. Can we solve NP-complete problems on such graphs (maximum clique/max-cut) in polynomial time? What about some special cases of groups? For example, $\mathbb{Z}_n$ (a.k.a. circulant graphs) or $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\log(n)}$. That is, the input to the problem is the set of generators (and $1^n$ to represent the size of the graph). 

It is a standard fact that if $f:\{-,1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$ is a function of Fourier degree $d$, then its Fourier coefficients are multiples of $2^{-d+1}$. In particular, every non-zero coefficient must be at least $2^{-d+1}$ in absolute value. Therefore, by Parseval, there are at most $2^{2(d-1)}$ non-zero coefficients, and so the spectral norm of $f$ is at most $$\sum_{S}|\hat{f}(S)| \leq \sqrt{2^{2(d-1)}}\sqrt{\sum_{S}\hat{f}(S)^2} = 2^{d-1}$$. This bound is tight. For example the complete binary decision tree of depth $d$ has spectral norm $2^{d-1}$. This can be shown, e.g., by induction on $d$. The address function has also maximal possible spectral norm. 

For the sake of clarity, the fact we will prove is $\mathsf{NP} \not\subseteq \mathsf{P/poly}$ implies $\mathsf{NPI} \not\subseteq \mathsf{P/poly}$. Under the assumption that $\mathsf{NP} \not\subseteq \mathsf{P/poly}$ we have $A_1\not\in\mathsf{C}_1$ and $A_2\not\in\mathsf{C}_2$. It is clear that $\mathsf{C}_1$ and $\mathsf{C}_2$ are closed under finite variations. Schöning's paper includes a proof that $\mathsf{C}_1$ is recursively presentable (the precise definition of which can be found in the paper), and the hardest part of the argument is to prove that $\mathsf{C}_2$ is recursively presentable. Under these assumptions, the theorem implies that there exists a language $A$ that is neither in $\mathsf{C}_1$ nor in $\mathsf{C}_2$; and given that $A_1\in\mathsf{P}$, it holds that $A$ is Karp-reducible to $A_2$, and therefore $A\in\mathsf{NP}$. Given that $A$ is in $\mathsf{NP}$ but is neither $\mathsf{NP}$-complete nor in $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{P/poly}$, it follows that $\mathsf{NPI} \not\subseteq \mathsf{P/poly}$. It remains to prove that $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{P/poly}$ is recursively presentable. Basically this means that there is an explicit description of a sequence of deterministic Turing machines $M_1, M_2, \ldots$ that all halt on all inputs and are such that $\mathsf{NP} \cap \mathsf{P/poly} = \{L(M_k):k=1,2,\ldots\}$. If there is a mistake in my argument it is probably here, and if you really need to use this result you will want to do this carefully. Anyway, by dovetailing over all polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machines (which can be simulated deterministically because we don't care about the running time of each $M_k$) and all polynomials, representing upper bounds on the size of a Boolean circuit family for a given language, I believe it is not difficult to obtain an enumeration that works. In essence, each $M_k$ can test that its corresponding polynomial-time NTM agrees with some family of polynomial-size circuits up to the length of the input string it is given by searching over all possible Boolean circuits. If there is agreement, $M_k$ outputs as the NTM would, otherwise it rejects (and as a result represents a finite language). The basic intuition behind the argument (which is hidden inside Schöning's result) is that you can never have two "nice" complexity classes (i.e., ones with recursive presentations) being disjoint and sitting flush against each other. The "topology" of complex classes won't allow it: you can always construct a language properly in between the two classes by somehow alternating between the two for extremely long stretches of input lengths. Ladner's theorem shows this for $\mathsf{P}$ and $\mathsf{NPC}$, and Schöning's generalization lets you do the same for many other classes. 

For all these hierarchies (except the deterministic one), the decidability of membership in a level for a given regular language $L$ is an open problem. The links between these hierarchies and topological classifications (also called Wadge hierarchy and Borel hierarchy) also posed several open problems. For instance it is conjectured that the weak index hierarchy and the Borel hierarchy coincide. All these hierarchies are known to be strict, and some special cases of deciding the level (especially the low levels, or with input deterministic automaton) have been recently solved. 

It is possible. Consider all languages $L_1,\dots,L_m$ recognizable by automata with at most $n$ states. Now to each $x=x_1\dots x_m\in\{0,1\}^m$ we associate a (possibly empty) language $$L_x=\bigcap_{1\leq i\leq m} L_i^{x_i},$$ where $L^0$ is the complement of $L$ and $L^1=L$. Let $Y=\{x\in\{0,1\}^m~|~ L_x\neq\emptyset\}$. For each $x\in Y$, we choose $\xi_x\in L_x$. This gives a finite family $\{\xi_x~|~x\in Y\}$, we show that this family satisfies the wanted property. Take any $\eta\in X^{\mathbb N}$, and for each $i\leq m$ let $y_i$ be defined as $0$ if $\eta\notin L_i$ and $1$ if $\eta\in L_i$. We have $y=y_1y_2\dots y_m\in Y$, since nonemptiness of $L_y$ is witnessed by $\eta$. We show that $\xi_{y}$ satisfies the condition. Indeed, for any $L$ recognized by an automaton with at most $n$ states, $L$ does not separate $\eta$ from $\xi_y$, by definition of $\xi_y$. Notice that this family is optimal in size, since if some signature $x\in Y$ is not represented by some $\xi_x$, the property fails. Its size is at most doubly exponential in $n$. 

If I understand it correctly, Gauss's lemma implies that that $P$ and $E$ have a non-trivial common factor over $\mathbb{F}[x,y]$. But in the beginning of the proof of Lemma 8 they assume without loss of generality that $P$ and $E$ do not have a common factor. More specifically, they show that if $P$ and $E$ have a common factor then they can use induction to show that $E$ divides $P$. 

Is it possible that $\overline{SAT} \in NTIME(\exp(n^{0.9}))$ ? Are there interesting consequences of such containment? Would it contradict the Exponential Time Hypothesis? 

Obviously this can be done in polynomial time. For the analysis note that if one of the constraints has no satisfying assignments, then clearly the given instance is not satisfiable. Otherwise, if all constraints are satisfiable, then a random assignment satisfies each assignment with probability at least $2^{-q}$, and so, in expectation a random assignment satisfies at least $2^{-q}$ fraction of the constraints. This means that the value of the given CSP instance is at least $2^{-q}$, and by the gap assumption must be 1. 

For a quantum channel $\Phi$, let us write $J(\Phi)$ to denote the associated state: $$ J(\Phi) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1\leq i,j \leq n} \Phi(|i \rangle \langle j|) \otimes |i \rangle \langle j|. $$ Here we are assuming that the channel maps $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ (i.e., $n\times n$ complex matrices) to $M_m(\mathbb{C})$ for whatever choice of positive integers $n$ and $m$ you like. The matrix $J(\Phi)$ is sometimes called the Choi matrix or Choi-Jamiolkowski representation of $\Phi$, but it is more frequent that those terms are used when the $\frac{1}{n}$ normalization is omitted. Now, suppose that $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$ are quantum channels. We may define the "diamond norm distance" between them as $$ \| \Phi_0 - \Phi_1 \|_{\Diamond} = \sup_{\rho} \: \| (\Phi_0 \otimes \operatorname{Id}_k)(\rho) - (\Phi_1 \otimes \operatorname{Id}_k)(\rho) \|_1 $$ where $\operatorname{Id}_k$ denotes the identity channel from $M_k(\mathbb{C})$ to itself, $\| \cdot \|_1$ denotes the trace norm, and the supremum is taken over all $k \geq 1$ and all density matrices $\rho$ chosen from $M_{nk}(\mathbb{C}) = M_n(\mathbb{C}) \otimes M_{k}(\mathbb{C})$. The supremum always happens to be achieved for some choice of $k\leq n$ and some rank 1 density matrix $\rho$. (Note that the above definition does not work for arbitrary mappings, only those of the form $\Phi = \Phi_0 - \Phi_1$ for completely positive maps $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$. For general mappings, the supremum is taken over all matrices with trace norm 1, as opposed to just density matrices.) If you don't have any additional assumptions on the channels, you cannot say too much about how these norms relate aside from these coarse bounds: $$ \frac{1}{n} \| \Phi_0 - \Phi_1 \|_{\Diamond} \leq \| J(\Phi_0) - J(\Phi_1) \|_1 \leq \| \Phi_0 - \Phi_1 \|_{\Diamond}. $$ For the second inequality, one is essentially settling for the specific choice $$ \rho =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{1\leq i,j \leq n} |i \rangle \langle j| \otimes |i \rangle \langle j| $$ rather than taking the supremum over all $\rho$. The first inequality is a bid tougher, but it would be a reasonable assignment question for a graduate course on quantum information. (At this point I should thank you for your question, because I fully intend to use this question in the Fall offering of my quantum information theory course.) You can achieve either inequality for an appropriate choice of channels $\Phi_0$ and $\Phi_1$, even under the additional assumption that the channels are perfectly distinguishable (meaning $\| \Phi_0 - \Phi_1 \|_{\Diamond} = 2$). 

Given a regular language $L$ on alphabet $A$, its minimal deterministic automaton can be seen as a directed connected multigraph with constant out-degree $|A|$ and a marked initial state (by forgetting labels of transitions, final states). We keep the initial state because every vertex must be accessible from it. Is the converse true ? I.e. given a directed connected multigraph $G$ with constant out-degree and initial state such that every vertex is accessible from it, is there always a language $L$ such that $G$ is the underlying graph of the minimal automaton of $L$ ? For instance if $|A|=1$ it's true, since the graph must be a "lasso" with a prefix of size $i$ and a loop of size $j$, and corresponds to the minimal automaton of $L=\{a^{i+nj}~|~n\in\mathbb N\}$. The motivation comes from a related problem encountered in a decidability reduction, where the solution is easier : starting from a non-oriented simple graph, and with more operations allowed like adding sinks. But I was wondering if someone had already looked at this more natural question ? The only things remotely connected I could find in the literature are papers like Complexity of Road Coloring with Prescribed Reset Words, where the goal is to color such a multigraph so that the resulting automaton has a synchronizing word. However minimality does not seem to be considered. Update: Follow-up question after the answer of Klaus Draeger: what is the complexity of deciding whether a graph is of this shape ? We can guess the labeling and polynomially verify minimality of the automaton, so it is in NP, but can we say more ? 

These SDPs do not all necessarily have analytic solutions, but they have the same flavor as the examples mentioned in the original question in that they represent interesting and arguably fundamental quantities in quantum information and computation. There are other examples as well -- these just happen to be ones I'm familiar with. The original question asks if there is a general theory behind the existence of analytic solutions to SDPs. I am not aware of such a theory, and cannot see much hope for one to exist. If you write down a random SDP, there will probably not be a nice closed form for the solution. The reality, at least as I view it, is that things work in the other direction. The SDPs for the fidelity and trace norm mentioned in the original question were specifically designed to represent those quantities: it is not an accident that the optimal solutions were given by such nice and important functions. If you have another quantity in mind, you might be able to express it as an SDP in a simple way by using some thought to come up with the SDP... but going in the other direction, from an SDP to an analytic solution, seems certain to be hard in general. 

Here is a natural candidate: the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$, and to a word $v=u_1cu_2c\dots cu_k$ with each $u_i\in\{a,b\}^*$, you want to associate $$f(v)=\sum_{i=1}^k \min(|u_i|_a,|u_i|_b)$$ There is a straigthforward exponentially ambiguous automaton for this $f$: each time you see a $c$, guess if you go to a state counting $a$'s or to a state counting $b$'s. It should not be too hard to prove that only exponentially ambigous automata recognize this function $f$. As a very sketchy argument, consider the fact that between two $c$'s, you must either count the number of $a$ or the number of $b$, so you need two different states to do so. Since you must be able to oscillate between these states, it means that you have distinct paths of the form $p\stackrel{w}{\longrightarrow} p$ for some state $p$ and word $w$ (containing some $c$'s). 

I detail the comment below, as you could be interested in this answer. I don't know about NFA, but if your goal is to represent this language with a small automaton, you could use the model of alternating automata, or AFA. Intuitively, DFA are with $0$ player: the run is updated automatically, NFA are with $1$ player who has to choose a good run, and AFA are played by two players: one tries to accept, the other to reject. The word is in the language if the "good" player (who wants to accept) has a winning strategy on this word. This does not increase the expressive power of automata. Here, you have an AFA with essentially $kr (\log n)^k$ states: At one point the opposite player can guess that some letter with same position modulo $r$ will be equal to the current one. Then the "good" player guesses $k$ bit positions of the current letter (this requires $(\log n)^k$ memory) : one which will be different for each later equivalent position. Then we just have to check that one of these bits is indeed different every $r$ positions. 

There are many examples in quantum information and computation where quantities of interest are expressible as optimal values of semidefinite programs. Here are a few beyond those mentioned in the question: 

Here is a possible alternative to a padding argument, based on Schöning's generalization of Ladner's theorem. To understand the argument, you need to have access to this paper (which will unfortunately be behind a pay wall for many): 

No relationship is known to hold between QMA and AM, and it is reasonable to conjecture they are incomparable. If QMA were proved to be contained in AM, it would be an absolutely enormous result in quantum complexity. Of course it would imply that BQP is in PH, which itself would be huge, but it would go beyond that -- it would surely require major revelations about the structure of quantum algorithms and quantum certificates. Having said that, the evidence against is not very convincing. An oracle relative to which QMA is not contained in AM would help, and it seems like such a result may not be far off -- but we don't even have this yet. A proof of the reverse containment, AM in QMA, would also be huge. At least here we have an oracle relative to which AM is not contained in QMA (and in fact is not even contained in PP). 

Take an alphabet $A=\{0,1,2\}$, and $U=0^*+2A^*$. Then, $U^\omega$ is not deterministic Büchi recognizable. To see this, imagine it is recognized by a deterministic Büchi automaton $\mathcal A$ with $n$ states. Then, look at the run of $\mathcal A$ on the word $w=2(0^{n+1}1)^\omega$. Any inside loop of $0$ must contain a Büchi state, because otherwise pumping yields a contradiction (we get a word of the form $2A^*0^\omega$ that is in $U^\omega$ but not accepted by $\mathcal A$). But then, it means that $w$ is accepted, and therefore $\mathcal A$ does not recognize exactly $U^\omega$. 

It would be great, not only for Maths and TCS, but also for natural sciences. There the problem is even bigger: by publishing only positive and "sexy" results and ignoring negative and boring ones, we can end up with a very wrong idea of what actually happens. This is because statistical noise can be presented as relevant, when only results above a certain threshold of "interest" are published. For instance if 5 studies try to answer the same question and only one finds a surprising result, it might be the only one getting published. In Maths and TCS the picture is different, as the main interest is to help the community by putting a "dead-end" sign at the beginning of some roads, and save time for people who were going to explore them. Collecting counter-examples is another very interesting aspect of the project. Bottomline I'm all for it, and would support initiatives like the one usul is proposing.
