Apparently, this has been an issue for a lot of users starting from the version 4 where the transparent top was first released. Most users are satisfied with simply disabling Aero system-wide. But I just witnessed a rare (bugged?) occasion where after opening an application that forces the Aero effect to be turned off as a mean of increasing system responsiveness, and after said application shutting down, the Aero effect was restored everywhere except for the content part of the browser window. The browser window's border was transparent, yet the area with "File, Edit, Help, etc" and address bar remained opaque light-blue color. I liked that. Is there a way to make this permanent? This is a shopped mockup of what was going on, since I wasn't able to reproduce that and make an actual screenshot: (and it's in Russian, so don't be afraid) 

When you select some files and copy them, the file copying dialog appears with progress bar and speed indicators. But when you select some other files and copy them, another dialog pops up and both seemingly show more than 50% speed slowdown as compared to only a single file copying dialog. I'm fairly sure that back in the days doing this with a floppy disk actually did slow down the process significantly. But is it the case with HDDs and SSDs in modern Windows OSs? Does copying several batches of files through multiple file copying dialogues slow down overall I/O operation in Windows 7? For example, let's copy a hundred of 50 MB files from HDD A to HDD B and right after that copy another hundred of other 50 MB files from A to B. So the files aren't small and the slowdown isn't caused by file table stuff issues due to small size. Both disks are 90% empty and contain no fragmented files, so there are no problems coming from that way too. Disks are connected via SATA, and aren't external. 

Streaming is really a way of downloading. When you watch a streamed movie, your media player will download parts of it, show them to you, and discard the shown parts of the file on the fly. Typically, when you download a file, you wait for the download to finish, and only then start watching it. But there are media players that are capable of showing you the downloaded part of the file and automatically pause and wait for some more to be downloaded. Kinda like streaming, but without discarding the file. Technically, when the concern is total amount of data transfered, it doesn't matter how you download it, but the difference between the file that you download and the file that your media player downloads for you as a stream. They may be the same exact files, and it will mean the same bandwidth in both cases. Streaming media sites usually encode their content to have lower bitrate than a store-bought disc. But you can watch a movie from your desktop PC on a notebook via WiFi using the file sharing function of your OS, and it will take up almost the same amount of traffic as if you were watching it on the desktop (as read bytes from hard drive). Technically it would be streaming, as you watch a movie while parts of it are being continuously downloaded and discarded. So the answer is it absolutely depends on the size of the two files âˆ’ streamed via media player and downloaded to the disk. 

In your case there would be an extra option like "Undo compression" which you could should be able to remove. I haven't had that exact situation happen to me, and so this might not be 100% correct, so please comment to explain what is different in your case from what I'm supposing is happening, as it might be helpful info for everybody else who encounters the same issue. 

How do I manually trigger the "turn off display" function in Windows 7? This normally happens automatically when the user doesn't move mouse or presses any keys for a certain amount of time (power management section of control panel). Third party software or a full blown application is nice, but I'd prefer an approach native to Windows 7. Like a command line or something. 

I have many archive files that I would like to re-pack into archive format, as that would save me a lot of space. How do I batch-repack those files on a Windows 7 computer? I tried doing this via GUI version of 7-zip archiver, but I didn't find a corresponding function. WinRar has a "Convert" functionality, but it doesn't archive into format. I'm not asking exclusively for a solution involving Batch-file scripting. 

Some popular apps and games have very many files that are not frequently used in normal operation, so there are large distances over which the hard drive needs to leap over to get to the next bits it needs. My understanding of file fragmentation is when files are scattered in pieces throughout the hard drive and seeking/reading times increase because of that. Defragmentation or consolidation of those files is a common way to improve the hard drive's performance to base level. But can the parts that aren't often (or at all) used be moved somewhere away, and the most used portions be placed next to each other consequentially in the order the app reads them most of the time to improve its performance? I understand this problem might be solved by hard drives which have shorter access time to very different locations like Solid State Drives, but aren't they also affected by that somewhat still? Would it make sense practically to move around application data like this to further reduce disk time as opposed to perfectly defragmented state? 

I'd like to find a way to automatically hide (or show) those columns, to avoid duplication. But this doesn't happen with all columns at the same time, and it doesn't happen in all folders, so just changing default "music" folder columns is not gonna cut it. Are there any complete solutions for that? If not, are there ways to create scripts/programs that can get all values for columns that would be shown in current folder and set which columns to show that I could develop myself? 

I've been watching various anime lately and I noticed that around generously decorated with subtitles opening and ending sequences, the CPU spikes, free buffered frames pool drains and severe lags appear, making the picture and, eventually, the sound tear. Disabling subtitles altogether makes for a perfectly smooth audiovisual experience on my rig, except I can no longer enjoy singing along without subtitles. I've already tried modifying configuration to force DXVA video processing, but that doesn't seem to help, because the problem isn't in the video, but in subtitles, processing of whom relies on CPU, not GPU. Is there a way I can speed up subtitle processing in Media Player Classic to avoid lags and tearing? 

Checked or unckecked, the checkbox does nothing and this window always appears. In the Applications tab, the file type is set to open with a specific application, and the window still appears. How do I stop this madness? 

I like non-smoothed fonts on my desktop's monitor, but some apps just don't look okay because they use built-in fonts which are not suitable for aliased rendering. So when I need to do some reading, I have to re-enable font smoothing system-wide by checking the ClearType option in control panel. I am using ClearType Switch to speed up the process, but still this is not very convenient. I'm looking for solutions for Windows 7, 8 or the upcoming 10. So far I know there are applications that modify Windows' native font rendering modules, like MacType, but in case of MacType, it does not remember which apps it should and should not affect. I'd like to find a more reliable solution that would "just work" without constant adjustment. Is there any way (native or using third-party software) to render text in a specified way for specific applications? 

"Disable desktop composition" flag disables Aero (transparent glass border) effect for the duration of the application's run, which seems like all there is to "visual themes", but toggling the "Disable visual themes" option doesn't seem to do anything. What exactly are these "visual themes"? How does disabling them affect the system? From what I can guess, a "visual theme" is a custom window border style around window content area created using hooks and WDM API calls, though I am prepared to be corrected. 

I'm encoding some videos and I'd like to add a thumbnail which would load faster than the filesystem browser auto-generating it with the default approach. I've found a number of separate tools which either generate or add existing thumbnails, but I'd like an ffmpeg solution since I'm using it for encoding already. The thumbnail should be an image from either 25% or 33% of the video's duration. 

Without the obvious hogs like hybernation and paging files, shadow copy, saved update and installation files, what takes up so much space that it needs ~7-10 gigabytes for a fresh installation? Wikipedia lists that older versions of Windows NT required ~1.5-2GB (Windows XP and Server 2003), and then from Vista onwards it blows up to 15GB. What's in those extra 13 gigabytes? I suppose there have to be new built-in apps that didn't come with XP and the new Aero Glass and theming textures, but it can't possibly take up all that much. What else does it contain? And how did XP and older Windows editions could work just fine requiring much less installation space? 

Update: Today I tried a bunch of third-party apps like Virtual Audio Cable and such. They all introduce horrible noise due to how much CPU power it needs to perform fast without errors. Setting the latency to higher values fixes the noise, but duh, the latency becomes huge (~4 seconds). Either I'm not configuring any of it right, or it does require superior processing powers to perform flawlessly. Note: I sometimes play some tunes on a midi keyboard in FL studio and I know how well my PC handles a bunch of instruments with the flawless sound at very low latency (<15ms) thanks to ASIO, so my computer is not very slow and that software shouldn't be underperforming so badly. Update 2: ASIO and multiple sound outputs got me thinkin. I have a pretty cheap Soundblaster audio card, which has multiple input and output channels that I'm not using. Maybe I could manipulate the sound flow with an audio program? Something about sending the game's output to an unused "line out" device, grabbing it with an app and sending both to me and to an unused "line in", mix in the microphone input, which Skype would then pick up. Update 3: After some experiments with rerouting inputs and outputs via ASIO, it turned out that Skype refuses to use any audio devices involved in such tampering.
