Bizarre to want to do it using Chrome rather than wget but it Works for me The format is Chrome URL, (you wrote start there in between which you shouldn't) 

Or e.g. below where the caret really makes all the difference. Looks from below like the caret symbol may be your answer, see line 3 below. 

An Interface address is an interface (network )address, a network interface address, it's just a network address that belongs to an interface. Though almost all belong to an interface if they're being used. The term you've used brings up an important point. Almost all network addresses e.g. IP addresses, belong to a network interface. (if they're used at all). Any device with an IP Address, has an IP Address on an interface. A network interface is the electronics of the part where the network cable connects to - the controller there. Or where the wireless device connects to. NIC stands for network interface controller or network interface (controller) card. WNIC is wireless network interface controller or wireless network interface (controller) card. IP Addresses belong to network interfaces, not to the computer itself. You don't ping a computer, you ping a computer's network interface. Even if you ping 127.0.0.1 , 127.0.0.1 is known as the loopback interface. So even that is known as an interface. A computer could have a NIC with many ethernet sockets, many network interfaces and each one with a different IP Address, see the IP Address belongs to an interface. And electronically, if you ping a computer, you're actually pinging in particular, a or the network interface on the computer. There aren't many examples of IP Addresses that do not belong to an interface. An IP Address you haven't assigned to an interface (so it isn't assigned to a device, because IPs aren't exactly assigned to devices, only to interfaces of devices). The network address I suppose does not and even cannot belong to any interface(though I may be wrong on that). And the broadcast address e.g. 255.255.255.255 designed to be sent to all interfaces, no interface would have that address. 

This populates an array and prints it You could use names1 names2 names3, rather than names[1] names[2] names[3] by writing names!i! instead of names[!i!]. It produces the array by generating variable names. There isn't an array structure in batch. But it is as neat as any array structure, and populating or printing looks exactly like how one would populate or print an array in a proper language(that actually has the array structure!) 

i'm not complaining, just observing.. Windows 7 is no longer prompting me when opening a cmd prompt. My UAC setting seems to be default 

pull them out.. run the computer. It's probably not a fan but make sure fans come on just to be sure. But test power button and reset buttons 'cos it could be one of those. Those one pin things that go to the front of the case, could be the power button, HDD LED(LED on the front of the case showing HDD activity), or reset button.. you might even see what it is by running it when it's out and running it when it's in like if it's an LED. or you could fish out the motherboard manual and it'd have a picture with clear markings, particularly useful if the motherboard markings aren't very readable. To extend, well, if you have another box you could cut some similar sized ones and strip them and tie them together. When you cut them and strip the ends it's just copper wires you can twist together. or an electronics store has wires like that on a reel. 

Well as one should expect, ISERROR returns True as 1 and False as 0. so it's saying if there's an error in that match statement. $URL$ so if that match statement returns one of those values office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/â€¦ "#N/A, #VALUE!, #REF!, #DIV/0!, #NUM!, #NAME? or #NULL" if you do ISERROR(value) and value is any of those then that returns True. This page here $URL$ says that "If the MATCH function does not find a match, it will return a #N/A error." An if statement has 3 parts. The condition, and what if true and what if false. True here is referring to the ISERROR function returning True i.e. a no match. False would be the ISERROR function giving no error i.e. a match. So, it looks like it'll print "No Match" in the cell, if the match function returns with n/a, i.e. if there's no match. And it will print "Match" in the cell if the match function returns a value(i.e. not an n/a, not an error). 

But I can't see what unicode to search for to find it I'd like to be able to search for it in both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [\uFEC1] seems to find the character, but it finds more than that character Now, if I throw a few FEC9s in there, then I see [\uFEC1] seems to find them too 

So I set "Create Symbolic Links" to include Everyone as well as my username. as described here How do I create a link in Windows 7 home premium as a regular user? 

I know I could change my external drive letter's drive letter from F to E and it should be fine, but I want to be able to fix this within virtualbox, either in the virtualbox GUI or command line or editing a virtualbox vm configuration file. If I right click the VM, settings is greyed out So I see no option to change from E to F 

If a keyboard or mouse doesn't work in a USB port, plug a keyboard or mouse into a ps2 port. If a computer only has 2 USB ports, or even 4.. then 2 ps2 ports are particularly useful. I have almost never had to plug/plug ps2 it seems so reliable. USB i've had to though maybe largely because i've plugged them into a USB hub. When you plug a ps2 keyboard in as soon as power goes to it, e.g. if it's off and you turn the computer on. or if you've been "risky" and plugged it in while it's on as a test, then the lights flash, power goes to it. When plugging a USB keyboard in you don't get that indication. (I suppose you could tap num lock etc but you tend not to get immediate indication) A negative, is apparently ps2 is only not hot swappable, but doing so can damage the motherboard $URL$ $URL$ that was old news so maybe has changed.. 

This is very strange I am in Windows 7 I tried creating an administrative command prompt and creating a file there called a.a I did another called aa.exe earlier 

2 ideas A) Not piping but if you use putty or whatever ssh client, so you access the python interpreter. if you run SAMBA on lnux, then linux will do windows file sharing, and then your windows code editor can view the remote files as if they are local. But you may want to make sure that the windows code editor doesn't go nuts if the connection breaks e.g. a cable comes out. or B)Another way might be dropbox. So the files are local on windows and synced with your linux machine, then your python interpreter which you run via putty and your windows code editor see the files locally 

While there is %USERPROFILE%, Maybe you want something like cmd can't do i'm not sure about powershell. Linux shells eg bash does though.. and you could use cygwin, as cygwin can do it for you, giving you a bash shell in Windows. Here we have a directory structure of 

No, you already have SSH opening a port listening on port 8888. You can't have another thing listening on that port. If you put the http[s] proxy on port 22 of the destination machine(server-address), and configure your web browser to use proxy 127.0.0.1:8888 then your web browser could connect to port 8888 and that will be forwarded to the http proxy on port 22 of the destination machine. When you did it means you have to have something listening on port 22 of the destination machine. And you might want to change 22 to something more sensible like 8080 I haven't tested it but I think it'd work Alternatively, SSH does have a -D option too that acts as a SOCKS proxy that can do HTTP[s] , but tell the web browser to connect to a SOCKS proxy rather than a regular HTTPS. So I suppose then like the line David said The -fNg and -v isn't essential of course. 

The problem is modems that aren't just modems, and do NAT Double NAT is more work with port forwarding and people usually try to avoid double NAT. (i.e. they have just their router device doing NAT). You could unplug the modem from the wall, connect your comp to it directly, and make sure it isn't giving you a private ip to access its interface. If it is then I suppose it's doing NAT at least to some extent. If the modem is connected to the wall, you brave potentially connecting to the internet directly with just your OS's or other software firewall(comp doing PPP), then you could check more and do ipconfig and tracert to a website, see if any private addresses. Really the ideal may be the modem bridging, otherwise you have double NAT and port forwarding is more work. An ideal is if your modem is a pure bridge, no NAT. Can even be no PPP. And the Router device you have does PPP(connecting to your ISP). Your modem looks like it's just a modem $URL$ so you just have to configure your router. 

say the url is $URL$ put in your hosts file If your URL is $URL$ put in your hosts file you don't include anything after the domain name in the hosts file. But you do include the exact whole domain do `wget www.google.com/abcdefg?a=b -O index.html -d' then look at the headers and you will see if it's going to 10.0.0.1 and see a GET header saying /abcdefg and any parameters should be there. The hosts file is I suppose, meant to be like a quick DNS cache it at least works like that, so you don't specify anything after the domain in there, and also it won't remove it from the URL you enter into the browser. It just changes the domain into the specified IP and leaves the rest, which I suppose is what you want. But you may want a web server that you configure, because if you do and it does 10.0.0.1 and that's your router configuration it's like accessing your router without entering user/pass so you might just get an unauthorized page back from your router. Besides the fact that there is no abcdefg directory on there. You wrote " I tried doing this on my host file without success (even without the get parameters)" <-- that should read hosts file. And you should get an effect and understand what the hosts file means for the browser. But if you want to redirect on a way that is conditional not on the domain, but on the directory/parameters, or on the domain+directory/parameters, such that the same domain can redirect you to different IPs, based on the stuff after the domin in the http request, then the hosts file won't do that and i'm not sure what will. You could look into if squid can but you might want to set it up as a transparent proxy as well as seeing if it can redirect in the manner that you want. 

The way a router works is the computers on or beyond one interface don't know the MAC addresses of the computers on another interface. And the thing is, that technically you could take a router with 2 ports, one internet side and one LAN side, and a switch, and that's how most peoples "routers" are. And in that situation, technically, theoretically, and they're not built like this, but technically.. If TCP/IP were very different, you could do away with the IP Addresses.. on the LAN. It just won't be as efficient.. on a huge LAN. Since IP addressese are hierarchical and MAC addresses are flat. Hierarhical means e.g. you can narrow a computer down to a subnet, like narrowing a person down to a country when sending a letter. You can get it to them quicker. 

I am trying to download this video with downloadhelper, the firefox extension $URL$ but I just get audio only. This is particularly with this video clip. The solution must use Downloadhelper, the firefox extension. The solution must be tested to successfully download that video not just the audio of it! If you do succeed, then the question is, why am I not succeeding in it? This answer is not a duplicate of something already answered, since i'm asking specifically for regarding downloadhelper firefox extension, and a mysterious problem of audio only, specific to this clip. Added- It seems the downloaded file does include Video(even though the 10min clip is only 20MB). It wasn't playing before, but it is now. I haven't re-downloaded it. Before it was just playing audio and displaying a blue screen with no text when I played it in VLC.
