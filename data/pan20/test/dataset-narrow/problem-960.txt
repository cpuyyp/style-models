I have Gateway NV53 Series and recently it stoped to work - not respond to nothing and just stay on with the capacitive touch key as in the follow picture . What does that touch key mean(the lighted key) ? 

I use and . The "Correct" answer suggested here (first search result in google) didn't work for me and gave same error . 

I downloaded eclipse-jee-juno-SR2-win32-x86_64 and selected Git repository explorer under window>open perspective>other . Now I trying to do the following as in this mannual , at stage 4 it asks to chose clone option , but as I am seen there is no such an option , in other computer I seen that this option is exist . I work with windows 7 Home premium . I attach screenshot of this occur - 

In order to get Win7 ISO bootable it can be obtain from Microsoft download or create one by myself like this tuturial .Assuming that both of them are same version , is there any differnce at installation between them ? 

It is very possible! But judging by the simplicity of your question, I assume you would like to simply run a program which will magically make your computer twice as fast, which is not possible. You need to understand that when a program runs it maintains its state by provoking the CPU to move memory between the HDD, RAM, and CPU registers, as well as addresses on various components (such as video cards or network cards). The trouble with using a CPU from another computer to help you is that it needs access to the same memory. And maintaining a mirror image of your computers memory on another computer requires so much overhead that it easily defeats the purpose of trying to add another computer to gain performance :) But the type of things which can be split among multiple computers are image rendering or some mathematical calculations which can work independently. 

This has to do with run levels, which selects a set of auto-started services. Recovery mode (which usually selects either run level or ) starts a very minimal set of services. It does not start graphical, network or antivirus ones to cite a few. You can see a list of services installed on your system this way: 

Note that this behavior is not consistent across releases of column. Version 2.26 uses to compute cells visible width and leads to a different mis-alignment. 

In my case I have two results being and and in fact the first is a dependency for the second which is the module to use. Load it this way (with root privileges): 

works on a per-character basis. It counts printable characters of each cells and then pads to align them (see code sources for v2.29). The problem you are facing is that your stream contains non-printable ANSI escape sequence embedding printable characters. then fails to compute the real cell minimal width of those cells and misaligns next cells of the same row. 

I use Eclipse Juno - Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers , and I can't run any Java project , mean even there is no "Run" option . For example when I right click on the Main class I just see (no "Run") - I use and and they both locates at - 

I have an file which doesn't opened by Acrobat Reader but it opened well by Chrome . That file looks like it converted from to format . This is the prompt message I get in the Adobe - 

I ordered this New 56K USB V9.0 V.92 External Dial Up Voice Fax Data Modem for Windows7. Now I found that it NOT support windows 7 64 bit . I have 2 questions : 1) Does that USB modem need any installation or just connect its USB is required ? 2) Is there any solution to work with that USB modem in windows 7 64 bit too ? 

I don't think you need to run as root for your need. Let's have a look to your hard disk device file. It should looks like this: 

feeds left-hand command with right counterpart. This has a meaning for the command, which prints its when no file name is given as argument. But this has no meaning for which always ignores its and only prints its arguments. 

And you can read their time-stamps using a simple command. I think it will show creation time-stamps closed to deletion time. 

Since this is Javascript, you can of course create and use private helper functions and variables. Further reading You will find a bunch of documentation over the Internet. Among others: 

But the death and parentship of the child is not exactly as you say. Basically ­—and when the parent process is still alive— the child process is the child of its father (yes!-) It has its PPID (parent process ID) set to the still-alive process which forked it. Things changes when the parent process dies. Child process continues to live but its PPID is set to a still-alive gran-parent process. There is always one since process never dies. 

How could I export all the contents of Device Manager to an file or any other format which can show me the hierarchy and all properties there ? I could not find any idea except print screen . 

I have windows 7 Home Premium , now I want to format my laptop and then re-install the same window version , so before I do that I got an screenshot of , which is shown below 

My environmental variable point on . Using Win7 . I could run java before until I added Egit extension for the Eclipse . Any solution please ? Edit: That's what has under "Run configurations" - 

How or where do I download Windows XP Professional (English) (32 Bit) ? - I have a product key. As I seen in google search Microsoft release some ISO for Windows (like here) but I didn't find any link for the version I need . Direct link would be welcome . 

You either have to go out of your way (removing hard disk, risky downloading) or spend some money (external drive, or get yours fixed). Unfortunately there is no solution which will be cheap AND easy. 

If I am editing a file in GVIM and for agurgument sakes the file is a XML file with the extension ".xml", and I click "File > Open" ... GVIM will filter by files of type ".xml" which is fairly annoying. It is annoying because often I have files which do not have the appropriate extension for the type of content they contain, which means that when I want to open another file I have to change the filtering every time. So either getting rid of this filtering or adding extensions for a file type would be great :) 

I have a few apps on my iPhone, and would like to sync them with iTunes without erasing them from my phone. Is this possible without downloading them all again? 

Such setup makes it very easy to describe comprehensive routing rules based on the URL you are connecting to, or even base on your computer IP address (home/company network) and the weekday (workdays/weekends). Example file Here is an interesting example for you to see: 

You should setup a proxy.pac. What is a proxy.pac This is a small Javascript file you can host on your computer. You feed your web browser network configuration with this file and its method will be called to route every URLs your browser need to access. This Javascript method can use a set of useful pre-define test functions and should return either: 

The daemon can also helps in this situation. It runs in background and learn which programs and libraries are often in use. It then them on next boots for a faster launch. As opposite to those files are not locked in RAM but read once after boot so their RAM space can be reused for something else if required, hence there is no guarantee of a faster launch.
