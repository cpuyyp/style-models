I open two side to side bash widnows one with : the other with , I start and go on youtube. I got two IP to which my computer sent (no ) but I got some IP in the monitoring window that don't have their counterpart in the other bash. I'm just trying to understand how this whole thing work, could you explain why there are packets part of an ESTABLISHED connection that were never initiated ? I think closing konqueror for more than 2 minutes should close all the connections associated with the software, so if I reopen it 2 minutes after it should resend all the SYN packets. 

Hello I'm trying to understand how OpenVPN works and I'm wondering the following thing : Since all the traffic should pass through tun0 once the computer is connected to the VPN you should be able to block et0 using iptables and be fine. However with Wireshark I'm still reading packets going to the VPN server through eth0, but then what is the purpose of tun0 ? 

Windows is regularly complaining about a faulty disk, that I should urgently make a backup because it will soon stop from working. I got this message for over a year now, it stopped for few month and now it comes back again. Problem is that it causes blue screen on regular basis too. Now the faulty disk in question isn't the one where windows is installed on. I wonder if it possible to find the faulty sectors and tell windows to stop from trying to access it without cutting the partition in 2. 

Type .LOG on the first line, and then press ENTER to move to the next line. Save the file. Each time you open it, it adds the time/date stamp. More info here: $URL$ 

Because it worked fine when you manually paused it, here is a temporary hack that you may be able to use until the "right" solution is found. Generally using "delays" and "timers" like this is NOT what you would do for mission critical things. That said, until a better answer is found, you can do this and see if it works: 

64-bit Windows 8 has Hyper-V (virtualization) built-in. Hyper-V only works if the host machine is equipped with a 64-bit processor that supports a feature called Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). [SLAT may also be known as extended page tables (EPT), Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) and nested page tables (NPT)]. Does the "Dell XPS One 27 Touch" PC with i7 processor released in Q4 2012 support SLAT so that you can use the Hyper-V feature built-in to Windows 8? ** Note: I should have mentioned that I do not have this system and can't personally check it. The processor in question does support SLAT/EPT because it has the i7-3700S processor. Still concerned about the potential BIOS/Setup dependency though at the overall system level. When looking through the owners manual for this machine I do NOT see a specific setting to enable SLAT/EPT (unless it is named yet again something else in the Dell setup screen). So I was hoping someone who has the machine could confirm Hyper-V actually works. 

You can create a custom Environment Variable and use that in the shortcut's path instead of hard coded version path. Use the %MYCUSTOMPORTABLEPATH% in the shortcut path itself instead. You can also keep part of the path fixed and just store the version in the Environment too. D:\PortableApp\%MYLATESTVERSIONNUMBER%\prog.exe Just like you can use %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in a shortcut path, you can also create your own vars. Just update your environment variable when you upgrade and the shortcut should point to new stuff. That said, having version-less paths may work fine too depending on your needs. 

(I'm paraphrasing but you get the picture). So we've got a file missing. Booted into the install disc, used a copy command and restarted. Got a little further. Got to safe mode screen, tried to start it normally, and another file missing. . That one might be important... I figure instead of playing this game, we'll copy over the whole folder to get things done, and get fresh copies of everything. So Booted to the disc, and this time the start up repair ran. Didn't solve anything (I restarted and checked), but it ran. Booted to CD again, stopped it from running, and copied over all the files. Now we get to the Safe Mode Screen and the progress bar. But before the progress bar can start loading, we get a blue screen of death. Which leads us to... The short of it Booting, in either normal or safe mode leads me to a blue screen of death. Unfortunately, I think windows crashes because the computer restarts before I can read what it says. And just so it's out of the way, automatic restart on the BSOD is turned off, so it should stay up and show me details. I've 

I ran into this issue with the same card, and my issue was overheating. You say the card idles at 45c, but you may want to check what it runs at in a game. My card (the same exact card) was hitting 115c and my computer would shut off. If you alt-tab out of a game (or I used a second monitor) and have Catalyst Control Center up, check to see how hot your card is. Now, that all said, mine idles at 75c because I didn't ever apply new thermal paste, but its just a thought, cause I know these cards run hot. 

John Guin at Microsoft (MSDN) wrote an import tool that should be able to handle this. His bug fix post with some screenshots: "Updating the OneNote Text File Importer" $URL$ And the link to the original post that has the updated code you can install: $URL$ 

You could just right-click on your Windows 7 Desktop, choose Gadgets, select the Clock to add it to the desktop, right-click on the clock and choose options, and give it a name like "US Eastern", or "Dusseldorf", and then pick the time zone you want the clock to dislpay from the list. You can add multiple clocks and configure each one to the time zone you need. 

If you choose to use a Local Account, you get a nice "clean" USERPROFILE path of: C:\Users\username If you then associate a Microsoft Account to that Local Account, will it maintain the original USERPROFILE path created above by the Local Account or will it try to CHANGE the USERPROFILE path to what it uses when using ONLY a Microsoft Account without a Local Account? Example - When adding an MS Account to Local Account will it try to change USERPROFILE: 

EtherPathÂ® SS-1R Single Port Serial Server "Ethernet Modem" by DCB (Data Comm For Business, Inc.) $URL$ I have experience with these in the field (hundereds) for 6+ years and not one has ever failed. We have not used their "EtherModem" mode but if the quality of that holds up like everything else in this device then it is worth a look. I do not know or work for them, just a happy customer. 

A VPN provider gives .ovpn files that contain the configuration necessary to connect to a VPN server using the command : However using this command isn't very clean since it uses a shell that you can't close anymore if you want to keep the connection. Instead I'd like to be controlling the openvpn connection through systemd but it is my understanding that I first need to create a file in so I can then call the command which would be handy since it would connect to the VPN server at startup. How to go from the .ovpn config file to ? 

After trying to install Qubes unsuccessfully I rebooted my computer and my boot entries were gone. Before I had and that I could boot on from the UEFI boot menu. So I go to the windows command line from the installation CD and type or it says that . However the windows partition is still accessible and seems fine by all means, the windows folder is still there... Other threads on this problem refer to things to do inside but I don't have such a folder and thoses threads are on Windows 7 or Vista so does anyone have an idea on what I have to do ? Is there an equivalent of C:\Boot for windows 10 ? How do I restore the windows 10 boot ? 

When using p2p softwares such as a torrent client or emule I am unable to open ports even if I allow them in my firewall and forward them in the NAT configuration. Even after doing those two things the p2p softwares say that the port is closed. However I am still able to download, so how does it work, why do we care about the port if the softwares are able to receive packages even tho they detect the incoming port as being closed ? 

If you have Administrator access, one way to do it is to use a PowerShell script and run it with Task Scheduler. Typing that process with all the script code here is not something I can do right now but it already exists out there: First, create the PowerShell script that understands the names of your two network adapters by following these instructions: Hey, Scripting Guy! How Can I Enable or Disable My Network Adapter? Then, using Windows Task Scheduler, setup scheduled tasks that call the script with the desired parameters to enable and disable as needed: How do I set up a powershell script to run as a Scheduled Task in Windows? If you are willing to read those two posts and experiment, you should be able to get it to work. 

To mess with times in V1 it uses milliseconds. (So 10 seconds = 10000) To mess with times in V2 it uses seconds. (240 = 240 seconds) I would never use this in production but if it is not that big of a deal, and it proves to work just fine 99% of the time, it might be good enough. 

Your path name with ~'s in it ("~ALL~") may not be ideal. An easy thing to try is to extract these files into C:\VB6mouse Run console as admin, and try again with a path that doesn't have any uncommon characters in it. Do you get the same error as above if you try from this new path of C:\VB6mouse? 

You can try to use $URL$ to create a script that activates Outlook window, sends keystrokes to send/receive, then minimizes Outlook window or something similar. Then, create a shortcut to this script, assign it a hotkey key combination in the shortcut, and push those keys to make this script run real fast and then get back out of your way. 

My startup is randomly getting very long at the UEFI screen (the one with the motherboard logo and the shortcut list : F2 for BIOS, F11 for Boot list ...). For like ~30seconds my keyboard is unresponsive and if I want to go to the UEFI I have to begin pressing F2 after those 30seconds have passed. I say it is random but this bug seems to occur when I do operations on a USB drive such as burning an .iso on it or rewriting its partition table, it happened to me while modifying partition tables on both window and linux. I say it is random because it happened to me last night and the problem would stay even after reboots or shutdowns. Then I went to sleep and the next day the problem had disappeared. Now it happened to me again but I won't go off despite prolonged shutdons. I can fix it by clearing CMOS but I'm tired of clearing CMOS every time it happens because then I have to reconfigure the motherboard. CSM is disabled. Is there a known bug that has such symptoms on UEFI motherboards, some kind of VRAM bug or something ? (I have an Asrock fatality x99x killer 3.1) Edit : nvm just shuting down the power switch is sufficient to fix the problem, no need to reset CSMOS, still any idea on what is happening ? Edit : Happened again when I tried to boot ubuntu live USB except it is stuck on the black screen with the message I left it for 1min and did that. Had to shutdown power to restore it. 

The long of it (with all the details; skip ahead for just the question) So, Vista won't boot (surprise, surprise). But, I've gotten it a lot closer than when I started this process, so I have hope in a successful repair. So, this is for a friend who may have opened a virus (and apparently a nasty one if that is the case). She was perusing her junk folder, saw a message from one of her contacts that was in the folder, and opened it up. Unwise, but the milk is spilled. Her computer crashed, and windows stopped booting. That's where I came in (cue cheesy dun dun dah dahda). So, when I started, Vista would not boot, it would not show the vista logo, it would not show the safe mode options, and would instead just sit there with a blinking cursor. A great place to start. But I got a live disc for Ubuntu to make sure there were still files on the drive. Turns out, I couldn't even access the drive. At first I thought this indicated a harddrive failure that happened to have bad timing, but persisted just in case. So, I grabbed one of my Vista discs, stuck it in, and booted up to repair mode to see if it could fix it. Automatic startup fix failed, though it thought it was doing something, so we could at least read the harddrive enough to recognize windows. Stumbled around a bit until I came across the following commands: 

I'm working right now from the command line on the install disc (so still not in Windows). I've loaded up the file in Notepad, but it's not very helpful (and is very very large; ~360mb). I can't run a repair 'upgrade' install to repair everything because I can't boot to windows. And this leaves me at a wall. Any ideas for furthering my progress towards getting this computer up and running? Any help is greatly appreciated.
