None except from switching it off and not using it for the said number of weeks. If it's broken, it might break even more and take the data with it. 

Although most of the generic stuff has already be said, but formally the specific answers to your questions are missing: 

Your problem goes deeper: GPRS in general and EDGE in particular are tough grounds for TCP connections due to the unreliable nature of the transport medium and the constantly changing, incredibly high round-trip-times of the data packets. Transmissions would be painfully slow not due to the fact that EDGE is slow but due to the fact that internal TCP counters would time out repeatedly, retransmissions would be triggered multiple times filling up the narrow link and reducing the transmission windows. There has been some prior scientific work dealing with this topic. One of the efforts resulted in the publishing of a paper by the University of Cambridge (which is an interesting read) and apparently the implementation of the GPRSWeb Proxy software, which has not been released to the public. You may want to contact the authors or the faculty if you need more information on this topic. Opera Turbo indeed uses some of the techniques described in the aforementioned paper and they work quite well, but if you are looking for a browser-agnostic solution, take a look at Ziproxy: 

I was able to setup Squid with SSL support in order to tell Chromium to encrypt the traffic between the browser and the proxy server. This works fine. But this requires direct access to the proxy server. My problem: the proxy server itself can only be accessed through a proxy server. How can I tell Chromium to use a proxy to connect to the proxy without installing additional tools like corkscrew? 

I have a directory with all my PUtty log files. Now I would like to find the files containing a UUID. I know that the UUID is in one or more files. I tried it with Windows Explorer. 

Here is a description: $URL$ Emacs asks you, if the code should be executed. Executing foreign code is a security problem. You can customize the behavior: M-xReturnReturn See the documentation here: $URL$ 

It would not address the protocol-specific issues of GPRS, though. I would not use VPN links with enabled compression - it likely will not help your problem since the transmitted data is compressed already most of the time: most webmasters are using GZIP compression for HTML and CSS and image data is compressed as well and cannot meaningfully be re-compressed with lossless methods - i.e. without resizing and/or transcoding. 

This would introduce even if the is not present in the file, but as the content is a no-op, it should not present any serious issues. Take care to escape regex special characters in the line. 

I don't think it is part of the default start menu program entries. I always circumvent oddities of the start menu by letting users directly execute the startup command line through the execute dialog (best way to get there is to use the Windows+R keystroke as the "Execute" menu item is disabled in some variants of the Start Menu). In the case of Mail (32-Bit) this would be is located in your Office installation path, so typically and this one is inserted into the system-wide upon installation, so unless the is being messed with, it should work out of the box. If not, you still can navigate to the office folder and run it from there. As the control panel has become a real mess lately - nearly impossible to navigate anyone through on the phone - even navigating through the folders presents a more coherent user experience. 

The test program did 200000 system calls writing 50 Bytes of data during each call. Why is Syslog more than ten times slower than file IO? This is the program I used to perform the test: 

What is wrong with my Windows Explorer? What do I need to do to get in the year 2015 in Windows the functionality of a damn old grep from 1973? 

In the same way as Alt-Gr-m inserts a µ or Alt-Gr-e inserts a € I would like Alt-Gr-l to insert a λ. How can this be configured in Windows 7? 

I wrote a simple test program to measure the performance of the syslog function. This are the results of my test system: (Debian 6.0.2 with Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64) 

You can't customize ICS all that much. If you only need routing and NAT services from it, consider just using RRAS instead. It is configurable and does not come with a bundled DHCP server. 

The idea behind all that: ~/nas as the mount path would have the permissions assigned to it while the destination is not mounted, thus preventing modifications by you (as long as your user does not have root privileges). The mount command (needs root privileges to run) temporarily modifies the folder's permissions to whatever the destination's permissions are set to, allowing write access for your user. 

You are mis-interpreting the warning message here. It is not about the drive letter being the optical drive, but about programs and documents with explicit references to data stored on - which you are breaking by changing the drive letter. You will see this warning for any drive letter change, not just the one involving an optical disk drive. 

I try to use Unicode characters in file names. It is possible to use them, if I copy the character into the clip board and paste it into the file name. But I did not manage to enter them directly via the keyboard. I enabled the hex numpad registry key: 

But when I try to use it I never get the character I want to. I tried it also with several browsers at the browser test page but nothing works. When I enter Alt+++2222 I get a black smiley instead of the spherical angle. How can I use a Unicode character in a file name by renaming it with the Windows explorer? 

The new Radeon driver drives me nuts. With the old drivers it was very easy to downgrade the memory and gpu speed to keep the card cool. With the new driver I can not find the position where the options is. The result is, that the card gets up to 80°C and the fan gets extremely annoying. How to to downgrade the card with the new drivers? 

Check the event log to see if your system has kicked one of the remaining apparently functional drives out of the array before. Now if you are confident that the two remaining disks should contain all (or at least most) of your data, you might try your luck with data recovery tools (at least some do claim capability to find and re-assemble lost arrays). Alternatively, if you have spare disks you can copy the raw data to and are willing to experiment, you might check out if your array would assemble using a Linux Live CD and either or . 

As always with caching questions, the answer would be "it entirely depends on your workload". The cache is only of any use if your running processes are spending a significant amount of time accessing memory and exhibit a noticeable locality of reference for memory addressing (and are not happy with the smaller L1/L2 caches present per core for this matter). Having a high number of processes running within different threads increases the odds for thrashing of the shared cache and thus diminishes performance gains which possibly would have been achieved otherwise. This is also the reason for increasing the cache size with an increased core count - the more memory-competing threads you have running, the larger your shared cache likely needs to be in order to be useful at all. There is an oldish article from Tom's Hardware comparing two old P4 chips with and without L3 cache for a number of rendering / graphical workloads. The numbers are rubbish, as is the whole benchmark, but it contains a nice explanation of the caching architecture in general and L3 caching in particular. The bottom line: you likely would not notice the difference, but if you need the exact numbers, you would have to purchase both CPUs and run your workload on both of them to compare runtimes. 

I have an audio connector on board (Asus P8H67-I) and an USB audio card (Teufel). How can I use the two devices simultaneously? As far as I can see I have to set one device to the standard output device. I am looking for a way to set both to the standard output device in order to hear on both the same sound. Any ideas? 

You can see four different keys the key code 11 can generate. The man page for xmodmap explains which key gets generated by which modifier: 

Partition 5 for example starts at sector 3919923 and contains 15631182 sectors. Each sector has 512 bytes. You have to write down the start sector and size of your partition. Be sure to write it down in a way you can read it later. ;-) After that you can erase sda4 and create a new sda4 at the end of the disk having the same size. Now you can move the contents of the old sda4 to the new sda4 by the following command: 

You are looking for the plugin config directive, it is hinting at the resolution steps to build the RRD with: 

If you would like the logical partition order to reflect their "physical" location on the disk, can help as well. Just press "x" to activate extended functionality and use the f ix partition order function. You might need to adjust your s for Linux systems after that - Windows has GUID-based partition identification and should not care about the order. 

The utility will show you the number of interrupts per second, not just the CPU usage. It is worth looking at it to make sure you actually have a problem with the number of interrupts and not just a driver taking more processing time than expected. If the data suggests a driver problem, unloading the modules one by one to see when the load stops seems like the fastest way to identify the culprit. Also take a look at - it is giving you a more detailed breakdown on the kind of interrupts happening. Another thing to consider are power states - a CPU might be set into power-saving states where it would have significantly reduced processing abilities. Percentages would naturally go up as the cake of total processing time is shrinking. Use to see what amount of time your CPU is running in different available C-states and at what frequencies. Disable PM (e.g. by setting in BIOS setup) and see if this helps. Last but not least, it may be a hardware problem with an extension card or your NIC - consider unplugging everything you can to see if this might be the case. 

I tried to import photos and videos captured with a Nexus mobile phone. The photos and videos are stored in the DCIM folder. I have many more images on the mobile phone, which I do not want to import, for example MP3 album art images or images from other applications but the camera stored in many different directories out of the DCIM folder. Windows 7 imports all those images. Now I have music covers in my holiday images. How to tell Windows 7 to import only the DCIM folder and no other folder? 

You can not configure it, because Alt is not a key code modifier in standard X servers. In X11 keys can be defined and changed with . The program can be used to identify the key code. Start and press . On a German PC keyboard it looks this way:
