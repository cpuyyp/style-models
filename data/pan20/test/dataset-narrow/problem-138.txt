The link probably doesn't need auto-negotiation, but you probably should not change the default without a good reason. There is nothing about having it configured that will cause you any problem, and it only happens when the link comes up. It takes virtually no time to happen. You really don't want to make network changes, just because. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!" 

Routers route traffic between networks. If you only have one network, you don't need a router. A gateway is usually a router because it is used for traffic where the layer-3 destination is on a different network. If you only have one network, it doesn't matter to what address the gateway is set. 

How an OSPF router forms an adjacency depends on the network type. DRs and BDRs are used in multiaccess (broadcast and non-broadcast) networks. Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint networks do not use DRs and BDRs, but the OSPF routers will form full adjacencies with each neighboring router. When a network uses DRs and BDRs, an OSPF router will only form full adjacencies with those two routers, but those two routers will exchange with all the OSPF routers on the multiaccess network, so all the OSPF routers on the multiaccess network will have the same information. A detailed explanation of how this happens is too large for this site, but it is explained in detail in RFC 2328, OSPF Version 2. 

You can then create layer-3 interfaces. Add IP addresses to SVIs, and/or use the command on a physical interface to allow you to configure the interface as a router interface. You can configure the interface to you router as a routed link. The problem you are going to have is that the router will need to be told how to reach the networks on the other side of your layer-3 switch. If the router doesn't specifically know to send traffic for those networks to the layer-3 switch, it will send the traffic to its default route, probably the Internet. Routers learn routes in three ways: 

UDP and TCP are completely separate Transport Layer (Layer 4 in the OSI model) protocols. There are also other layer-4 protocols, but TCP and UDP are the most commonly used. UDP was first, and it is a connectionless, unreliable, fire-and-forget protocol. TCP was added later to provide connections and reliability to layer 4. Layer-4 protocols have their own addresses, called ports. UDP port 10 is not the same thing as TCP port 10. Applications register with TCP or UDP to use their ports. Only one application can use a per-protocol port at any given time, but if you have two different applications, one could use UDP port 10 at the same time as another uses TCP port 10. UDP is only used by applications which want to use UDP, and TCP is only used by applications which want to use TCP. Some applications will use both protocols, and some applications use neither. Neither protocol is required by IPv4 or IPv6. 

A gateway is the host on a network that knows how to reach other networks. Your host would need a gateway just to reach a gateway on a network to which it is not directly connected. An IPv6 host will know how to reach other hosts on any networks to which it is directly attached, but it still needs a gateway in order to reach other networks. While IPv4 uses ARP (broadcast) to resolve a layer-2 address from a layer-3 address, IPv6 uses ND (link-local multicast). Both of those protocols are confined to the local link. Each will give you the layer-2 address for a host on the same network as your host, but neither can tell your host how to route to a different network, other than pointing you to a gateway on your network. 

Enabling port security is extremely easy at is core. It gets more complicated with the options. Enabling port security on a switch port is done with a simple command: Cisco maintains documentation on its commands. 

Not quite right. It's not that two routers connected via iBGP cannot learn any prefixes from each other. Suppose you have two WAN routers in your AS, A and B, both connected to separate WAN ASes via eBGP, and connected together via iBGP. Router A cannot learn prefixes from Router B about which Router B learned from other iBGP speakers in your AS, but it can learn about prefixes which Router B learned about from eBGP or an IGP. Any prefixes which Router A learns about through iBGP from Router B cannot be passed on to any other iBGP speakers because those prefixes could be sent back to Router B, directly or indirectly. That's the reason for needing a full mesh or a mitigation such as route reflectors or confederations; other iBGP speakers will need to learn the prefixes which Router B will share with other iBGP speaker directly from Router B since Router A is unable to pass those prefixes on. 

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, and it can only communicate through connections. Before you start programming using TCP, it would be helpful to first understand how TCP works, and you should start with RFC 793, Transmission Control Protocol, which is the definition of TCP. The RFC explains sockets and connections: 

Based on your comments, you are looking for the data usage over different time periods. You will need to use something like NetFlow or some other method to generate your reports. The command uses the interface command to configure its time period. It defaults to seconds minutes, and it can be set from to seconds. 

What you need is a router. Routers route traffic between networks, but layer-2 switches (what your switch is) do not. VLANs keep the networks separate, and to get traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN, you need a layer-3 device (router or layer-3 switch). Your router will need a route, probably a static default route, for the interface toward the bigger network, and the router on the bigger network will need a route to the network behind your router. The easiest way to do this is to share a routing protocols with the router on the bigger network. That way, both routers can tell each other the networks about which they know. You really want fixed IP addresses for your router interfaces, if it is at all possible. For your switch, you only use trunk interfaces for links that will have multiple VLANs crossing them. You tag the frames on a trunk link so that the switch on the other end can tell which frames belong to which VLANs. You could have one native (untagged) VLAN on a trunk, but all the other VLANs on the trunk will be tagged. Native VLANs can be a security problem, as can VLAN 1, so the recommendation is to not use native VLANs or VLAN 1. 

IP packets have source and destination addresses. Outbound the souce address will be the PC and the destination will be the web server; inbound will be just the opposite. When the router wants to send the packet to the PC, it encapsulates it into a layer-2 frame. The layer-2 frame has source and destination MAC addresses. Assuming the PC's IP address is not in the router's ARP cache, it will send an ARP request to find the PCs MAC address, then encapsulate the IP packet in the layer-2 frame. The switch remembers which ports have which MAC addresses, but, if it has forgotten, it will flood the frame to all ports. The switch just switches the frames. 

If the houses are 500' apart, Wi-Fi is not the answer since, like copper UTP cabling, it is limited to 100 meters (328'). With multi-mode fiber, you need to be aware of the distance limitation for the particular fiber interfaces you are using. Also, terminating multi-mode fiber can take experience and the proper equipment to polish the fiber ends, and a microscope to inspect them. Outdoor fiber needs to be armored, gel-filled, loose-tube fiber that is buried at least 24", or deeper if the frost-line goes deeper where you are. Stringing it overhead involves a whole other set of conditions such as load bearing cable and lightning protection. Outdoor cable cannot extend more than 50' indoors, and it should not be directly connected to your equipment (you must terminate it to your indoor cabling system, properly grounded and bonded with lightning protection even for buried fiber, which then terminates into your equipment). Outside plant cabling is an entire specialty unto itself. As Ricky Beam pointed out, the equipment required will be well over $500, and you probably are in way over your head. Home networking (off-topic here) is nothing compared to what you are trying to do. You also need to check beforehand about the legalities: sharing of a single Internet account, the local and state laws regarding easements, and the National Electric Code. I got into trouble as a kid when some neighbors and I rigged our own communications wire between houses, and the local telco had a fit. You may need to hire someone who knows how to do this sort of thing.
