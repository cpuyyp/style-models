I believe this is intentional behaviour of the implementation of these headphones. The idea is that music audio is pushed through the 'speakers', and voice audio is pushed through the 'headset'. As soon as the 'headset' or 'mic' becomes active the device assumes that there is a voice call and makes a (questionably reasonable decision to) mute the music channel. I guess this workflow is most appropriate for car/handheld devices but I use this headset on my PC where I'd prefer to have better quality voice audio (my VOIP client will allow me to pump audio through the speakers, and it is noticeably better sounding than headset). But such is life. Curious if this is the norm for bluetooth headphones with multi source? This is my first pair. 

This is getting very annoying. In the future we will not buy razor products but with the current line of devices, is there a way to prevent this from happening? I have asked on the Razor forums but they have gone as far as to delete my followup posts on this issue, so thought to ask here. 

Normally I disable the DisplayPort audio devices and use a bluetooth headset for audio, for the most part it works well (I have two U3014 monitors.. Occasionally when I connect the monitors to the ports, they become re-enabled (as shown in the screen) and set as the default audio device. This doesn't happen always, but enough to start getting old. This doesn't happen all the time however - most of the time it seems to be fine. I suspect it has something to down with the whether I've rebooted or the sequence in which I suspended and disconnected from my home monitors (where it also happens). Does anybody know if there is a way to make HDMI devices permanently disabled? Setup is a Metabox (Clevo) P775DM3-G . Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 14393) 

Hi I have a Windows 7 installer and I'd like to extract the built-in drivers of Windows 7 to be used in my windows xp install. Is it possible that I can make use of the drivers from windows 7? I'd like to install windows 7 instead of Windows XP but the hardware isn't ready for Windows 7. Drivers i'm interested is for Video and Sound. I also can't download drivers because i have a slow internet connection. Thanks! 

I have a software that accesses a website, I want to monitor what website is it accessing and block that website. Is there a software similar to "windows task manager" that allows you to monitor software that accesses a website? I want to know what website/server is it accessing so I could then block it. And Is there an alternative way to block aside from "host" file? Thanks! FYI: running on Win7 

Notice that when i downloaded the images, i am only interested in placing them in the secondary directory ("vegetable" and "pets") and didn't include the first directory anymore... Is there any software that let me do this? I have a MACOSX and Also have a Windows 7, So any would do for me. Thank You. 

I'll be re-install my Operating system in my desktop, It would be a clean version of windows7. I wonder if there's a software that lets me install my application automatically or an easier way to install all my old application. I still have all my installer sitting in my hard drive. I just need a software to automate it, but not to hard to configure it. What would be the process that you would recommend if you're in my shoes. I'm still using my old windows 7 here in my desktop. But before I format my old drives, I would want to get your suggestions and opinions. I also stumbled on a cool software "Windows Post-Install Wizard" But the problem of this is I'm having hard time to configure it. Thanks! 

I'm using Windows 7 Running Chrome 38.0.2125.111 m, Google Hangouts plugin 2014.910.433.1. I'm experiencing the behaviour whereby if I disable notifications for a particular person, it makes me invisible to them. I'd prefer this to not happen. (At face value it seems like odd behaviour but on reflection it seems in line with the rest of the design decisions that have gone into the product). Is there a way to disable it from happening? edit: I'm trying to disable notifications by unticking the 'Notifications' checkbox in this option for that user: 

Since Windows XP or before, you are able to force delete a file by holding down shift while pressing delete. For some time now I've noticed if you select a LARGE number of files (e.g. 20k) or so, shift-delete does not force delete - instead it presents the option to send to recycle bin in the same way as if you had just pressed delete. In trying to consistently reproduce this error I have found that it is not based on a pure threshold. Sometimes I am able to properly shift delete 10k files, sometimes it prompts me to recycle 5k. It makes me suspect that something asynchronous is going on in the background but I can't really speculate as to what. The short and sweet of it is, is there a way I can consistently shift-delete a large number of files? Running W7 64-bit for what it's worth. I think i experienced this in XP as well but can't say for certain. 

I have a Philips SHB8850NC bluetooth headset. When I'm playing audio through this device, if I click on the 'recording' tab, the audio mutes. As soon as I change the tab back again, the audio resumes. There is a slight static click when I switch the tab. I'm not sure what this means, but thought it was worth noting as it is audibly different from performing a software mute button on e.g. my keyboard (which mutes/unmutes without static click). I also noticed that occasionally while communicating over via headset plugged into the 3.5mm audio jack of my laptop, people would complained about my voice being extremely soft. When I clicked on the recording tab, it would fix the volume until I changed tabs. What is going on here? Is this intentional design (and if so what is the rationale)? Is there a way to prevent it? I am frequently fiddling with my microphone settings because of the above and it would be nice to be able to do so without muting my audio.

Is there anyway I can do automation on the background while doing other activities in my Laptop? I'm using Keyboard Maestro with recorded event, like mouse interaction to a form and looping from a datasource. If I'm doing the automation I cannot do other stuff in my laptop because my mouse and other actions are being utilized by the Keyboard Maestro automation process. Is there I can split my window (like virtual machine) without installing a new Mac OSX? probably just a small software that will virtually give me an option have 2 windows running without interfering the other one. or else i think I'll have to install Mac OSX in my VMWare just to run the automation process. Any thoughts? Thank You. 

[my process] in [Set1] I enter "bridge.hisdomain.com" in the hostname of PuTTy. after I hit Open It will open a terminal and will asked for a username. thats where I provide my [Set1] username and password. Ounce login, I then perform [Set2] Details. I will use "ssh username@123.456.789.123" after I enter it, It will then asked for my password. from there, when I do "DIR" in command prompt I will see al my files there. I wanted to download a directory there to my local drive but I am not familiar with the commands. I would like to access it just by using FileZilla or similar. And I've also tried this but I don't know what I'd miss, because It didn't work for me. I downloaded a .pem file from the [set1] because I can also access it using a regular FTP (filezilla) and I then converted that .pem file to .ppk. right now I'm kinda confuse what login info I should use for my FileZilla to access the server. I had success in loging via FTP using [Set1] login details. But my files aren't there. I only saw some folders and a .pem file. I can't login to my Filezilla using [set2] details. I tried FTP and SFTP. I also added the .ppk file in the settings of my fileZilla. But I had no success in loging in. any ideas what did I miss? 

My company publishes simulation software that regularly performs prolonged CPU (and GPU, and occasionally I/O) intensive tasks. Our userbase are engineers, of whom some are embedded in large companies, of which some still subscribe to fairly archaic mindsets regarding IT that better belong in the 90s. More than a few times now we have experienced situations where client computers which are extremely highly specced (some are commodity machines with 5 digit dollar values) are running simulations anywhere between 2-30 times slower than the same simulation on our internal machines. The client machines outspec our internal machines in basically every aspect (CPU, GPU, RAM, disk). In a few rare instances we have been able to identify the antivirus software as the culprit, but this has typically been more due to serendipitous circumstances than any solid detective work on our part. We do not have a lot of experience with antivirus but from what we've observed, a lot of active scanning antivirus software does not appear to take up CPU itself, or even show up as a task manager process, but (presumably) the CPU utilisation is assigned to our process instead, causing these massive performance slowdowns. On other occassions (sometimes when rapidly accessing anywhere between 1k-100k binary files) it will simply appear to frequently cause the CPU to throttle down to 0% usage, so the system effectively idles for prolonged durations (whereas on our internal machines the CPU maintains a steady 100% usage until the task is finished) On occasion when the antivirus is turned off we have seen the performance immediately come up to the level expected. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to ask the IT departments of these companies to do this based on a hunch (and understandably so). In some circumstances they are also disinterested in genuinely supporting their engineers more than the absolute minimum so this becomes an unpleasant interdepartmental fight. Is there a way we can reliably detect if the antivirus is causing performance issues so that we can better determine if it is worth having the argument? Depending on the client we may or may not have administrator privileges, so I would welcome solutions or suggestions for either.

My Hard Disk Drive just got corrupted due to electricity fluctuation. When I plug my Western Digital Elements, It ask me if I want to format it or not... I can't see my files or even the capacity of my disk from it's properties. Is there any solution you would suggest? looking for a software that can give me access to my files. I just need to copy it then I can retire my Drive and will buy a new one... Thanks! 

Is there an an efficient way of copying selected files to a new folder? I have a list of files I want to copy (including the path), I'm just not sure what command I can run to achieve my goal. I need to make a copy of some of the files, and preserve it's original directory structure. The selected files have varying location, some resides in the root folder while some are nested in sub folders. Source: 

Are there similar software or alternative to Adobe Edge? I'm looking for a software where you can animate your html elements visually or using a GUI and then it will export in HTML and using javascript(jQuery if possible). If there's none yet, I hope the jQuery (or other JS framework) community would develop a small app where you can just drag html elements, and animate it visually. 

I'm really curious of those software that promise you to make your RAM bigger and faster. But before I try it, I have to get your thoughts on it, Does the software really make your RAM run faster or boost your RAM? I just know that when you buy a physical RAM (eg. 2GB) and thats it. now if you wan't to make your computer run faster you would have to add/upgrade some of the hardware. Please share your Ideas. Thanks!
