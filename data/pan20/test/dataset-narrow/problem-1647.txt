This is a very simple audio output circuit that smooths PWM from the CPU through a bandpass filter @ 33Hz-15KHz. Additionally this shares a ground with other portions of the board, and there is digital noise and supply noise that is induced onto the output. You may get slightly better fidelity with a cleaner power supply, but a dedicated audio output device is still your best bet. 

When you go to the manufacturer site, what you are seeing are "development boards", they are pricier and usually larger than a consumer board, they are also sold in much lower quantity. They tend to expose all the features of the device, to will help evaluate your design. 

Register in your program in order to catch the and flush all the buffers/files opened by your program and script. Edit Following Additional Information Killing a program with will likely cause data truncation. This is actually implementation dependent and not always consistent between linux systems (some will all buffers on ). You need to change your design to shutdown gracefully. Some Background:: There are actually Two Buffers 

Short Answer: No, this type of data copy is quite fast, probably 2 ops per cycle, this is practically as fast as the core can move data around. To convince yourself, just look at the disassembly. Additionally, There is no way, that you will get the full throughput you desire from a kernel module, there is too much stuff happening in linux kernel constantly. Your limit will be CPU scheduling for the module code to execute and not the read speed of the module itself. You would need to run real time kernel or baremetal code. Note: By Parallel ADC I'm assuming you are referring to an ADC constructed from a resistor network using GPIO ports of the raspberry pi. 

You can easily check which one you have with a multimeter. Many Switches come in both varieties and you choses when you order, its just a matter of electrical need, sometimes you need NO sometimes NC, if you want to know why this would matter I suggest asking another question here or on electronics.stackexchange.com . However, all is not lost. You have the flexibility of inverting your logic, you may do this in code 

Create image with minimal fs size Specify in the option On first boot this script will execute and delete the line from 

Cabling in particular can be a big pain to diagnose. I was once sent to a customer site to diagnose a serious issue with our product, turns out their communication cable had a broken shield wire that only caused issues when multiple things were drawing power from the same power supply, go figure. Sometimes unscrupulous cable vendors do not perfectly meet the specification. Sometimes old monitors with worn out input buffers have hiccups. Sometimes damaged output drivers have hiccups. So its worth trying a different monitor or different raspberry pi (or other computer). It may be that the output mode is right on the edge of what the monitor supports but wont' complain and just try its best to synchronize. So try different output modes and update drivers. There are many options, but the power supply would be last on the list, you have a basic HDMI Hardware Problem you need to diagnose so keep swapping things until you find the part that is broken or incompatible. 

Wire Jumpers If you do not wish to mount a replacement part, then you should use wire jumpers to create leads for you to attach your power supply to. The critical thing with using wire jumpers on surface mount pads is to eliminate the possibility of any "pulling" on the wire, no matter what happens at the business end, this is known as Strain Relief For a good guide on using wire jumpers see this guide Attach those wires to the two outside pads of the connector footprint. If those pads are destroyed, there are solderable test pads (aka Probe Points) on the board, indicated on the schematic as through which are connected to the USB side of the power supply. You may use these instead of the pads directly on the USB footprint. 

My understanding, you have a script/program that collects data and displays this data on the screen. You would like to have the display on a desktop PC, but the data collection code executing on raspberry PI. This is the beginning of industrial control and automation, which is a very wide topic. Software Engineering You may split the program into a client/server where you have one application acting as a server, accepting commands to control the motor. There are a variety of approaches, a simple web server may be enough. In industrial systems, are used to interface controllers and sensors. XPRA (docs) is a X11 forwarder that allows remote code to run against a local , and allows for connect/disconnect like or . It has better performance and ability to reconnect compared to , but the principle is the same. start a remote terminal 

Power Supply Choices The simplest, is to continue to use a 5V supply with any external connector you wish. You can Split the power internally using a simple wiring harness. That is, from the connector, Individual wires go to the Raspberry PI, USB Hub, Display, HDD, etc. In a real pinch you could use the 5V OUT pin on RPI, which is the same as powering directly off of USB port. This is limited to 2A (10W) by a fuse regardless of supply, and will likely be starved. This can impact the processor if the voltage droops or spikes as the HDD spins up/turns on. 

Note, you will probably not do better than the off-the-shelf supply manufacturers in designing a fresh power supply in cost, efficiency, reliability. It's much easier to use a beefy linear regulator or an off-the-shelf buck/boost and not spend time developing your own power supply circuit beyond the most trivial power supply board . Its much easier to buy a wall-wart with an extra amp than to design a switching supply from scratch. 

Check! (Note, config is already done via files, the GUI tools are just interfaces to edit config files and periodically read status files to track dynamic information) Only thing that you Don't get is a GUI of any sort. More on that below. 

The main thread would run in a standard loop, you would check this flag every cycle. This way, when multiple interrupts are issued, the counter is incremented multiple times, but the redraw is only triggered when the main thread is ready, in other words the redraw is synchronous with the main thread refresh timer. A more clever way would be to use events/signals for the refresh. The main thread "sleeps" on an event and is woken by the interrupt handler. This way if there are many events the refresh is triggered as often as it can be, but if there no events it is idle. This makes the refresh synchronous with the interrupt. Regardless 

I will only give descriptions and prototypes, because this is a very broad question, if there is something specific you would like me to elaborate, please feel free to leave a comment. 

GUI Options When you write a GUI application, there are common elements that you usually need to have. E.G. 

Like the Raspberry Pi CPU , at this juncture, it appears that this company does not provide this part through any distributors. Your best bet is to purchase the development board or to contact them directly for samples. I'm sorry to say the cost you quote is for a volume design and not possible for a one-off unless you manage to scrounge some samples for free (still need a PCB) I did a check of some second market resellers and they do not even know about this chip. It is likely manufactured to order and thus can only be obtained from the MFG at this point. 

Debian packages are compiled against dependencies as they exist in the repository. That is, if you're application needs , debian will use the dependency from that release. Imagine this scenario, two packages Raspbian: built against Armbian: built against If there are differences between the two versions of , then if you install on a raspbian system, you will likely have an error when starting the application or a bug of some sort that may crop up. If the dependencies are equivalent or compatible, then the package will work as intended. You can, if you like, choose to install all the dependencies for a given package by simply adding the armbian repos to , however this will potential conflict with versions of the same packages, causing a broken system There are a few further complications, for example there are build dependencies which are seperate from package runtime dependencies 

Details Underlying your communication scheme is a single physical bus device that is embedded in the CPU. This device cannot be simultaneously used by multiple threads at the same time to put bits on the wire. If the kernel driver you are using locks that device, either due to real timing requirements (e.g. fixed delay for bus/device) or due to implementation inefficiency well then you are out of luck. Your user space code will block calls to the driver until the previous interaction has finished. In a polling based approach, using multiple threads is problematic, you have no timing or scheduling guarantees, so it is quite likely that your threads will end up blocking each other anyway, using much more time than manually sequencing it . Using locks in time sensitive code is a recipe for always missing your timing requirements. Locks are used for protection, if you are constantly thrashing a lock then your system is very poorly controlled, using locks for resource scheduling will not give you the resolution in time that you want. 

One simple approach for a trivial test application using bash that uses the shell function to present a result screen 

Raspberry PI, unlike a desktop PC, doesn't have a true hardware power controller, so the reset is "soft", using only the CPU reset mode. In principle, this shouldn't be very different, however, in practice, this type of reset is often "incomplete" because: 

Connect a Keyboard to the Raspberry PI, and change the TTY (Terminal) in order to switch from the GUI to a Shell ++ This should give you a login prompt. Login with your user and uninstall the skins or reconfigure to use a default skin. Note: This terminal will be a shell (Command Prompt), so you will have to determine the commands needed to uninstall or configure skins. 

Is the log message indicating that logger (rsyslogd) is being shut down (Signal 15 = Quit). So anything that happens after this point is not logged. A watchdog is a device that forces a hardware reset through reset pin after a certain period of inactivity. They are somewhat tricky to use. 

Stability and drift in the Phase-Locked Loop () inside the Broadcom CPU which generates the core clock Temperature Drift in XO resonance circuit Temeperature drift in the latching/clocking threshold detection circuits. etc. etc. 

What follows is a brief description of a few options for bare-bones displays. 1. Framebuffer The Raw Graphical Output on your screen actually is itself a file. This file is there even if is not installed. 

For wiring connections, terminal blocks are used to make a reliable electrical contacts in permanent installations 

Now, what this is doing is checking the value of the analog signal from an audio sensor, or, even simpler, an audio sensor that is filtered to produce when the signal is above 0 and when it the signal "flips". We add up the number of times we see positive signal, when the signal flips we have an estimate of the wavelength (/2) and therefore we can estimate the frequency. Then we count the number of "negative" signals, so on and so forth You can average these frequency measurements over some period of time to get a "cleaner" more stable signal A good way to get this zero crossing signal is to use a type of comparator called a . 

Linux Kernel has a certain number of "default terminals" (tty), typically this number is 7. By convention the system boots and the GUI runs on . The "X Window System" (GUI) runs inside this terminal. However, the other terminals 1-6 are still available to be used for other purposes. Sometimes these can be used to running multiple GUI Sessions, but they can also be used to recover the GUI system The standard keyboard-command to switch tty is ++(-) ++ will take you back to the GUI terminal () 

This pin is directly connected to the net, meaning indeed it is possible to power through that pin. When under USB power, this net is supplied by USB power, but there is no reason you couldn't power it yourself, however, replicating some of the protection scheme is worthwhile to protect power supplies and prevent fires. In my opinion, modifying the board (replacing usb header) is riskier and more error-prone than using an external supply with adequate protection. However, the simplest solution is to make a cable from your power supply or connector of choice to micro-usb, because you may as well re-use the circuit they have there. 

Your log is actually truncated. I suspect you have a hardware fault that triggers an unhandled CPU exception that causes the kernel crash/panic. One very common scenario is intermittent/failing/corrupt memory that causes an incorrect command to be loaded into the CPU which causes an exception. 

Compare subsequent cards from same supplier against the golden sample. Repeate step 2. every time the supplier issues a Product Change Notice (PCN) 

OCXO Clock references in precise equipment are usually in a constant temperature oven, and require some time to stabilize. These "ovens" provide a constant temperature (not necessarily HOT), usually controlled by a Peltier Element These devices are known as Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (). Unfortunately they require a significant change to the circuitry and are not drop in replacements. They Look like This: 

Switching to callbacks using may be sufficient, even if it is software deglitching. Real Hardware deglitching exists, but is poorly documented in Raspberry Pi. This is deglitching done on the clock cycle level (e.g. signal must be stable 2 PIO clocks before latching), configured directly via registers, and is used in hardware drivers and kernel side interrupt handlers. This is means interrupts as fast as possible while filtering many spurious events. 

Other Answer: You are chasing a ghost, 12MHz sampling with a simple ADC like this is unphysical, the electrical response of the A/D circuit is probably in the KHz at most. I will challenge your assertion 

The proper way to do this is to port the package by rebuilding the package from source against the dependencies. This is not guaranteed to succeed (sometimes things are actually incompatible), but when done correctly is very reliable. This is basically what is used to create repositories in desktop ubuntu/debian Explaining how to build debian packages from scratch is outside the scope of this question, but I would point you to my answer on for an introduction to what it takes. Building packages can be done on a desktop pc with the proper cross-compile or on Raspberry with native compiler. 

It can be. There are many system utilities and applications available that are written using python, often these programs work well, and are very well tested from many uses. Porting to Python3 presents a risk that may not be worth the effort. As such many systems will package both python2 and python3 in order to run software that requires one or the other. I would highly recommend that you learn to use and to create local, customized installations of python on a per-project basis. The "system" python is intended to support installed programs and may not be the version you want to use
