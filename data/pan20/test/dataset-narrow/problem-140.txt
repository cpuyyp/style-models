I'll briefly answer the question. The RIB (routing information base) contains all of the knowledge the router has obtained about how to reach destination networks. For example, it may have two different paths to reach the same network, both stored in the FIB. Or it might have learned the path the same network via two different routing protocols. Again, they would be unique, separate entries in the main RIB. The router extracts the best entries from the RIB and inserts them into the FIB (forwarding information base.) For example, the router might be configured to prefer paths learned via one protocol over another, therefore leaving behind one of them and not inserting it into the FIB since it prefers the path via BGP vs. OSPF. There could also be a tie, and it takes two equal paths and inserts them into the FIB. Bottom line, the router applies policy to extract the best paths from the RIB and insert them into the FIB. The FIB is generally composed of high speed memory that is used to build "hardware shortcuts" that allows the unit to switch packets at high speed. A hierarchical FIB seeks to eliminate duplication of fields/data in each FIB entry. See $URL$ Hope this helps. 

Each interface on your NIC should be assigned a different IP address or there will be an addressing conflict. You can either receive an IP address via DHCP or set one manually as you see through your GUI. Each interface also has its own MAC address for layer 2 communication. 

When a power outage occurs, any unsaved configurations will be dropped by your devices. In this case, your port configuration reverted to an older version. 

Trunk ports pass all vlan data unless otherwise specified within the Switchport Mode Trunk command. So at this point, the switchport access command does nothing. If the user who configured this switch had the intention of limiting the data that passed through this trunk to only 1 vlan, he or she should have used Switchport Trunk Allowed Vlan 100 

1.) Yes, the gateways should reside on the L3 switch. If you were running Routing on a Stick, you would instead house their gateways on the Router. Your current configuration is inline with what is called a "collapsed core" design. Where the L3 core performs both switching and VLAN routing and acts as a distribution layer. 2.) No, your L3 routing should be occuring on your 3750. 3.)If the cable modem is in bridge mode, there should be no double NAT. Bridge mode should disable all the routing features and leave the cable modem as just a cable modem. 4.) I would, just so you can hit devices on the seperate VLANs. 5.) The address of the inside interface of the Cable modem may be .1. Leave it as it is. Like Ron said, it doesn't need to be changed. Can we see the NAT configuration of your router? It will be helpful in identifying your NAT issue. ****EDIT**** This link may be helpful: Configuring NAT I failed to take note of the NAT statement you had originally. This brings into question the claims made by your ISP. You're both able to hit the internet and your being PAT'd with the correct commands. Are you experiencing any problems? 

Sure, why no. An address is an address. Just use AS numbers reserved for private use. See RFC6996 for details. 

RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service and was develop to authenticate, authorize and account (AAA) Dail-In users. Today it's often used as a centralized authentication server for the management interface for all kinds of networking devices. Another common use is 802.1X 802.1X is an IEEE standard used in wired and wireless LANs to authenticate clients. You'll have a client (called supplicant) an authenticator (a switch or access point) and an authentication server, which is a RADIUS sever. 

Dual-Stack everything For HTTP (and some other protocols): Use a proxy For a wider variety of protocols implement NAT64 with DNS64. This requires DNS and will not help with pinging IP addresses. 

wireshark and tcpdump should work. Several other tools as well. But if you have to ask, it probably not the right tool for you. 

ICMP and ICMPv6 are two different protocols. For ICMPv6 checksum callulation see RFC2463 section 2.3 and the documents reffered there. 

Make sure you have enough free space (type dir). It might be necessary to delete some files in order to get enough free space. This might leave you with no IOS at all so be careful when doing this. You can recover from this by copying an Image via xmodem but that no fun. Last time I checked Cisco was only offering MD5 checksums. 

sho ip int brief will give you a list of all the interfaces and their status as well as protocol. It will not show you if a cable is "unplugged" but will tell you if something is plugged into the interface and sending frames. sho int Will allow you to see if an interface is UP and whether or not protocol is also UP. If you are just looking to monitor status changes on the terminal, term monitor 

Routers operate on the Internet layer of the TCP-IP model. The Internet layer is synonymous with the Network layer of the OSI model. 

The above is the preferred configuration for VoiP phones connected to a client computer. Trunking was apparently the configuration used for older VoIP equipment. When configured as an access port, you can apply QOS to the vlan, prevent loops with STP, and lock down the PC/VOiP phone with port security. FYI, for PC/VoiP phones, you'll need to enable to allow for 2 macs on the access port. This link specifically shows the access port configuration. As for the difference between Trunks and Access ports, a trunk does add dot1q or ISL tags directly to frames and can exist on all or multiple vlans. While an access port only passes traffic from a set vlan but does not modify the frame with a vlan tag. 

I don't necessarily agree with the previous answers. It is true that these longer range optics aren't part of the standard. But Cisco special? Maybe they first introduced them, I don't know. But these are quite commonplace. The major difference is not the transmit power, but rather the sensitivity of the receiving side. They are a lot more expensive, maybe that's the main difference! If you aren't running DWDM/optical amplifiers, and have a one off long distance run or two, these could be a good fit for you. I am running some and they work fine. -mike 

There is nothing special about media converters in regard to single-mode fiber. A media converter would typically be used to extend the reach of copper (using fiber in between the media converters) or to accommodate endpoints that don't support the media in use. For example, if you have fiber between two endpoints that only support RJ45 copper media. You could use media converters to convert the fiber/optical to copper/electrical. 

One key use for per port MAC addresses on switches is for Spanning-tree BPDU's. These are Layer-2 multicasts with source MAC address of the egress switch port. I would have to brush up on other Layer-2 protocols such as TRILL and SPB, but they might also take advantage of a per port MAC. Does that help? 

I have a layer 3 3750 advertising its vlan interfaces via EIGRP to two routers. R1 and R2 connect to MPLS via 2 different carriers using BGP. R1 is the preferred path. My question is, how do I configure a default route for Core1 using EIGRP that will be aware of failures on either of these carriers. 

Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? The issue is widespread on almost all interfaces that house servers in the company. 

The above is actually the correct config. You are looking for 80mbs, 16mb, 2mb and 2mb Best Effort. 80% of the remaining 20mbs is 16mbs. This leaves 4mbs remainder available for priority 2 and Best effort. 

I have an interface that is Gigabit connecting to an interface on a carrier ATT router. The bandwidth of the ethernet circuit connecting to this interface is 10mbs. Is there a way to set the speed of the interface to match the bandwidth of the circuit? If QoS is then applied to my gigabit interface, will it be applied and aware of the 10mb rate limit? 

The core1 is able to reach R1 and R2 connected interface and loopback0 interfaces. The problem is that R1 cannot reach R2's loopback and vice versa. Each device is able to hit each others physical interfaces. 

Not all Cisco devices support all features. In addition to there are also differences between IOS versions feature sets. You have to check the documentation for the exact hard- and software version you are running. A quick search on google showed that the 3750G does not support Netflow. One possible workaround might be to setup a monitoring port and setup a Linux box to capture the traffic an export the Netflow data. This will only work as long as you don't exceed the the maximum capacity of the switch port your capture box is connected to. 

http.host - show all packets where http.host is set http.host != "" -show all packets is set and not an empty string 

You can send as much netflow traffic to a host as you like. Without some software listening on the host you wont collect any data. There are several options to choose from, my Debian box here comes with nfdump, pmacct, ntopng ant probably several others. There are many more options from a free and open source to very expensive commercial software. Where the data is stored depends on the software you use. In the past I found a combination of nfdump and nfsen (web interface for nfdump) quite useful. 

A Ethernet Repeater extends the usable range of ethernet cabling so it is not the same as a hub. This is a layer 1 device. You might be getting confused with the name "Repeater" and the function of a hub. Or you could be referring to Multiport Repeater which is just another name for a Hub function. A Hub is also a layer 1 device. It repeats data out from a source port out every other port. Collision is heavy on a hub. Bridges are layer 2 devices. They exist to physically seperate LAN segments. One of the only decisions a bridge makes is whether to forward or drop a frame. They are different than a switch as a switch can separate LAN segments on the same hardware using VLANs.Switches generally consist of a multitude of ports, while a bridge may only have one. 

Default BGP keepalives are sent every 60 seconds. If a participating device does not receive a return response within 180 seconds, the default Hold Time, a reconvergence will occur. So by default, it will take 3 minutes for your devices to determine a neighbor is down before reconvergence. 

I'm having trouble finding the actual temperature point where a C2821 router will send out the trap for temperature. So far, I know the operating temperatures are from 0C to 40C. But at which point does it send the trap?
