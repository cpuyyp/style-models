According to post here and on SO it should just be an issue with the service name. Problem is it looks right to me. Listener.ora 

That was difficult to figure out on my own. Research for the general error "Access Denied" in this context led to many different avenues but none that address my specific problem. Most stemmed from not using Reporting Configuration Manager to set up the service account. I did in my case and was able to verify the actions it took were done correctly. RsExec role, URLReservations using new account etc. I ran into a thread that said... 

I can connect to the db using and running shows the DB in question. So between that tnsping and I know the listener is at least running. does not appear to have an effect either. Not that it should matter since I should just have to wait a minute for it to work on its own. I then went looking for any PMON related logs. It should have been in the trace folder ($ORACLE_BASE/diag/rdbms/database_name/SID/trace/SID_pmon_PID.trc) with other trc files but it was not there. I then used the following query to verify where it should be 

Use a UNC path (\server\share). Using a a mapped network drive requires that the drive be mapped in the profile of the account running the backup (usually the MSSQLSERVER service account). THe account running the backup will, of course, need write permission on the shared folder on the file server machine. As an aside, you say this is running on Windows XP. I have two comments on this. First, push back on your customer/employer as hard as you dare that if they try and run server services on a workstation then they will get grief. There is a reason Microsoft have server and workstation versions of their OS. Second, it might pay you to check the edition of SQL Server (). If it shows "Developer Edition" then your company might be in violation of the license agreement. 

Remove the square brackets. Apart from that, the PowerShell code looks fine (and works on my test machine - the code I used is below, copied from my SQL Server test machine SERVER1). 

So it would seem the issue was not the service name specifically but that the request was going to the IPv6 address which was not set up in any of the required files. Looking at listener.log ( which for me was located D:\app\Administrator\diag\tnslsnr\dvp-oracle\listener\trace\listener.log) I found these entries associated to my connnection attempts. 

As part of the troubleshooting I was doing to try and address the issue I ran Process Monitor while I was trying to start the service. I tracked as event that also had a result of "Access Denied" which was the service trying to read files inside the directory where reporting services was installed an running from. In my case it was: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services" I check the security of the folder and the service account I was using had no rights to the folder. That is why giving it local admin rights fixed it because that group did have access. I gave my service account Modify access to the folder and its contents. After that I was able to start the service. 

Two drives, RAID 1 - Operating system, executables, pagefile. Four drives, RAID 5 - All data files (alternatively, RAID 1+0) Two drives, RAID 1 - All log files 

Both the default instance and SQL Browser maintain a list of instances running and their current port numbers. If there is nothing listening on those two ports (maybe there is no default instance, maybe the default instance is using a different port, maybe SQL Browser is stopped) then the only way to connect is to manually specify a port number in the connection string using a comma. For example, PRODDB\Payroll,14550. SQL Browser sends broadcast network traffic so a lot of administrators prefer to not run it. TechNet: Default Client Connection Behavior. As an aside, port tcp1434 is used by the default instance for the Dedicated Administrator Connection. 

After switching to a different master you must reseed the identity value, otherwise you will get duplicates in the id column. Use the statement. 

Windows 2008R2 with firewall disabled for testing (not that it changed anything). Listener.log doesn't show anything of worry. Just evidence of me restarting the listener many times. I am aware that I could configure a static listener with but I would like to understand why this is not working. This is the 4th time around that I have been doing this and I have not run into this problem yet. I am basically stuck since I am not sure where else I should be looking. 

I was having an issue getting SQL Server Reporting Services 2008R2 SP3 working under a domain service account on Windows Server 2008R2. It started with this What am I missing for my SSRS Service account local server permissions? and I have progressed from there some. I have a domain account setup as the service account for SSRS and the service is running. However on the /ReportServer and /Reports pages I am getting page cannot be displayed on my local server. Looking at the logs under "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\LogFiles" I saw two errors 

One of the following will do it from T-SQL. xp_logevent RAISERROR … WITH LOG Structured Exception Handling (including the THROW statement) is the intended replacement for RAISERROR, starting in SQL Server 2012, but THROW does not have WITH LOG functionality. 

"…but I'm curious as to whether there's a better way." Yes - use hardware or software RAID to create one RAID0 (or maybe RAID5, but write performance might suffer) array across the three 700 GB disks. Better still (as the commenter below says), add more disks and create a RAID array with fault tolerance. SQL Server databases are more manageable with fewer files, not more files. Is it possible to physically remove the hard disks from the old server and install them in the new server? If so then restoring the database into the new instance of SQL Server is just a matter of attaching the data files. Edit: The poster below makes an excellent comment about fault tolerance. A RAID0 array has no tolerance for errors. Then again, neither does splitting the database across three individual disks. I am OK with SQL Server data files being on RAID arrays with no tolerance, if and only if (1) there is a great DR solution, and (2) the log file is on an array with fault tolerance, and (3) the database is in Full recovery Model (so the tail of the log can be backed up). 

That tells me that the database registered itself dynamically correctly. prodbkp is my SID. This might be a case issue since I named the DB "PRODbkp" but everything else seems to be fine since I can connect with just fine. Case should not be an issue with service names as per docs.oracle.com tsnnames.ora 

For testing I have been trying to install Oracle 11g on a test system with a single database several times with the aid of snapshots. This most recent iteration I have been having issues getting the database to register with the listener. I am to understand that PMON, as long as the database is running, will attempt to register itself at regular intervals with a listener that is running locally on the same machine using port 1521. I have such a listener running but the service is not registered it seems. 

Which also looks OK. Most of the solutions point to SERVICE_NAME mismatches. However I don't appear to have one. v$parameter output 

Know your app. If your database has 14 GB of free space in the data files and your app is generating 2 GB of activity a day then there will be an auto-growth event in 7 days. If your database is set to "Autogrow by 4 GB" then there will be an auto-growth event every 2 days after that. Data Collection is an easy-to-set-up monitoring system that allows you too look at the history f database growth for a number of servers. 

First, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If no-one is complaining about the speed of the system then leave it alone. Spend time and money on other things. Second, no, I don't think it is possible to over-normalise. That is, I think it is possible to spend more time on the normalisation process than your application might need, but unless you've spent tens and tens and tens of hours doing so I don't think the time is really wasted. The time getting to 3rd normal form is most certainly never wasted. In my (admittedly limited) experience, the problem is usually under-normalisation, otherwise known as "laziness". Database designers often claim it is for speed purposes, throwing the term "denormalised" about like a holy mantra, but if you investigate closely, all they've actually done is half a job. Denormalisation is not "stopping before you reach a certain normal form"; it is "reaching a certain form (usually 3NF or BCNF) and then undoing some of that normalisation for well-documented, well-benchmarked reasons."

Which made sense since I had changed the account that was being used. I simply deleted encrypted content to address that since it was a new SSRS instance anyway. The second error was the one that took me for a loop 

That gap you see above prodkbp is in the output as well. Not sure if that matters either. My production server has that anomaly as well so I can't imagine that has anything to do with it. Basically everything looks right but something is still wrong. I cannot install Enterprise Manager Environment 

Really new to Oracle and being a DBA in general. I am trying to set up a development environment so that I can play an learn oracle better. Enterprise Mananger failed to configure itself when I first created the database using the Database Configuration Assistant. No biggie. Just need to user emca.exe I had some issues with the Listener but those might have just been me being impatient in waiting for the service to register or the service not running. Right now my issue is this from the emca log:
