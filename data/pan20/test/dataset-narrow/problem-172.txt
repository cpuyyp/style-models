The easiest way to mess someone up on "classful addressing" either on a test, or exam, or whatever, is to use misdirection by way of a subnet mask. Again, remember that the subnet mask does not apply for determining the class of an address. This is easy to forget because as others have said, classless addressing and routing have been around for over two decades now, and the subnet mask and CIDR notation have become ubiquitous in the industry. 

I've been spending the last week or so troubleshooting some (maybe related, but probably not) issues with Quagga. I have a test router - 7204VXR-NPEG2 running 12.4(24)T6 - with a single BGP session to a Quagga host. The only BGP session on the 7204 is with the Quagga box. This is an eBGP session. There is literally zero policy configured on either side, yet I get this without fail in output: 

You already know the majority of the answer to your own question - you need to configure commands the user can run at a specific privilege level. without a privilege level argument defaults to privilege level 15, which has permissions to run all commands. The two things you need to do are: 

This could very well be an issue with the SNMP implementation of your device (which you've given us zero information about by the way). It would be useful if you could edit your original question to include this information, as well as output from against the table. Also, you could try doing an against to see if you get results from that. 

Poison reverse is an extra add-on to the split horizon rule that overrides split horizon in cases exactly like you describe. The route with the infinite metric is sent from A to B and E, and from B and E to their connected neighbors, including A. The whole point is to get the entire network into a converged understanding that T and any networks behind it are no longer reachable. Here's a quote from the Wikipedia page for split horizon that took me less than 5 seconds to find with a Google search (still not getting the hint are we?): 

There are a few strategies to deploying AnyConnect. The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.4 describes them in detail including client prerequisites and configurations. 

WAN interface is a vague term but it has a couple widely used meanings. @RonMaupin has given a great description of what WAN interfaces mean to enterprises. In addition to his description, I would also add BGP as another important WAN edge protocol. However, WAN interfaces often have a slightly different meaning for SOHO and Small Business networking devices. The WAN interface is often a routed interface with a few additional features preconfigured. The features are bulleted below. The remaining ports on such a device are often switched interfaces. The purpose is to accept an ethernet handoff from a device such as a cable modem or DSL modem and provide internet access to the switched ports/interfaces. 

To oversimplify, devices running STP will broadcast BPDUs and listen for duplicate messages. If duplicate messages are heard, a loop will be detected and the STP domain will converge by blocking the appropriate ports. Many consumer-grade devices do not call out support for IEEE 802.1D or newer flavors of STP such as this common D-Link switch. Consumer-grade devices, without this mechanism, can form a loop between itself, or with another consumer-grade layer-2 device. The rest of the broadcast domain could be then subjected to the resulting crippling, broadcast traffic even though it is not a part of the actual layer-2 switching loop. There are some mechanisms (such as Storm Control) and strategies to reduce the risk and the effects of the negative traffic but they are outside the scope of this post. 

You can only deactivate Time-Based Keys as per the Cisco Documentation. The permanent key must be replaced with another permanent key with fewer features. 

Voila, load balancing. This also scales per interface, as adding a new port will involve adding another interface and a static route. 

From a design standpoint, specifically referring to the route servers, the answer is no, they should not peer with each other via an iBGP session [disclaimer: I've never personally attempted to do this, but I might now for fun]. The reason why is because route servers behave similary to route reflectors, only it's eBGP rather than iBGP. The most important part to remember though, is that a route server is not a router, it is a "BGP message broker". This means that to all of its route server clients, it does not participate in any routing decisions. Because of this, route server clients will configure their sessions to the IXP's route servers as a standard eBGP session, however, because the route server does not insert its ASN onto the AS_PATH of NLRI received from its clients before it advertises to its other clients, the client configuring the eBGP session will have to ensure that its eBGP config on whatever device they're configuring allows for a way to disable enforcing the first ASN in a path from an eBGP neighbor (see Cisco IOS implementation notes), otherwise (depending on the vendor of course) the session will not come up, or will come up but no NLRI is exchanged, etc. Keeping that in mind, by creating an iBGP session between the two route servers, every route server client will have to drop an NLRI update message from itself, that was received from one route server, forwarded to the other via iBGP, and then re-forwarded to the route server client that (presumably) has an eBGP session up with both route servers. This will basically cause unneeded headache (in the form of possible CPU and/or memory churn) for the route servers and all of their clients. With that said, yes, it is BCP to operate two route servers (without iBGP between them), and mandate that the route server clients peer with both of them if they're going to peer with them at all, as Leon Weber has already mentioned. In addition, it should be noted that designing an IXP "with redundancy" does not simply mean "running two route servers." Using AMS-IX as an example again, I suggest taking a look at their design documentation (specifically for 10G customers) for a good example of redundancy in an IXP. Again, just to provide a single example - a discussion on designing for redundancy within an IXP is beyond the scope of the format of this site.

Cisco has a large listing of Syslog Messages and Severity level here: Syslog Messages This list includes Syslog Messages for the following: 

There is another feature of to consider: External Routes. One trick I have used to influence EIGRP Primary and Secondary paths over DMVPN is to use a dedicated EIGRP AS for the secondary path and then redistribute it into the primary AS. Redistributed routes will be injected into the EIGRP process as External Routes. Externals Routes will have an AD (Administrative Distance) of 190 by default and therefore be less preferred. This is not always optimal nor can it always be applied in all use-cases but it is something to consider. 

Prefix Length - The longest-matching route is preferred first. Prefix length trumps all other route attributes. Administrative Distance - In the event there are multiple routes to a destination with the same prefix length, the route learned by the protocol with the lowest administrative distance is preferred. Metric - In the event there are multiple routes learned by the same protocol with same prefix length, the route with the lowest metric is preferred. (If two or more of these routes have equal metrics, load balancing across them may occur.) 

By default, the router will install the route learned via EIGRP into the routing table. This is because EIGRP has a lower Administrative Distance than OSPF. It should also be noted that both learned routes will remain in their respective routing processes. Thus, the router knows about both but will only select one route when routing. Routers select routes in the following order: 

While you may not be able to tell whether queues are explicitly being congested from the reports, you are often able to tell whether tags are being properly applied and honored. 

Keep in mind that if you're monitoring input queue drops, you'll see these happen across multiple subsets of ports, because (IIRC - someone correct me if I'm wrong) these map to the port ASIC's and the buffers are shared across port groupings (ASICs). Here's a link to a Cisco doc that has some other good info: $URL$ 

On most hardware/platforms, the Ethernet checksum is handled by the NIC before it's passed up to Wireshark. There's no way (or really any reason) to pass this up to higher layers because of the fact that the NIC does this in hardware, unless you've coded the hardware/driver to behave this way. Refer to the Ethernet wiki on wiki.wireshark.org for more information. 

In addition to Ricky's answer, you can also use the utility to dump information about SNMP tables and how table entries are indexed, etc. The flags will tell to print a tree view of the table. A very useful (and overlooked) utility IMO. Here's the output for (which is the table object to which ipNetToPhysicalEntry belongs): 

So think of this like a row entry in the table, and we've picked out column 1 from the row, which is ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress. So in this particular entry, the part is the index of the entry. The 1 is the ifIndex of the interface that the ARP entry is learned on, 'ipv4' is the ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType which is one of these: and finally, the IP address of the ARP entry, 10.200.17.34. These three things make up the index for that entry. Then the value for ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress at that specific index is the MAC address . 

Talking about terminology you've really already said transport which I think is what that type of service is most commonly referred to as. Sometimes folks will also refer to it as a "tether". You have another option of moving the interface on your side to the same router and then setting up eBGP multihop*** between you and your provider. Yes, you lose redundancy on your side, but on the opposite side it's going to the same router anyway, so that's kind of a moot point. This also eliminates the need for the provider to do eBGP multipath, in case they're not willing to do that with you (but I've found that in general most providers are fine with turning this on, if it's not turned on already). If that doesn't seem plausible then announcing two /25's is likely your best bet, unless of course your provider is willing to turn on (again, assuming they haven't done so already). ***Doing load balancing with eBGP multihop in your scenario will involve the following: 

Configurations should be sync'ed unless commands have been sent to the Secondary unit directly. If you suspect otherwise, a configuration comparison should be made. Some other recommendations are listed below. Ask any engineer and they will likely have additional recommendations. 

In GNS3, by default, nothing will persist after reloading your project unless your Docker Container is configured to do so. Your Docker Container may not be configured to have persistent data. This behavior is described in the official GNS3 documentation. 

In the event of all things equal and the routing process supports it, equal-cost load balancing will occur. Exactly how the router handles the load-balancing depends on your configuration, version of IOS and potentially your router platform. Cisco dives into the matter with the following documents. 

The simplest solution would be to add a dynamic routing protocol such as , or . Then raise the Administrative Distance of the static routes so the dynamically learned routes are preferred. These static routes with the higher administrative distance become floating static routes. 

You are receiving the error because the "password" you are entering is not a proper MD5 hash. Check to verify that you are trying to enter a complete MD5 hash and that it is not another type of hash. Cleartext, Type 4 or Type 7 passwords will not suffice. You may be trying to use a password obscured by a Vigenère cipher. The Vigenère cipher is often refered as a Type 7 password. It is associated with the and commands. Type 7 password hashes look something like this: 

R1 likely does not have a route to and R0 likely does not have a route back to . By default, a router will add connected routes into its routing table. This means that R1 will know how to get to , and . The router will not dynamically share or learn its routes with other routers without a dynamic routing protocol such RIP, OSPF, EIGRP or BGP. A router can be configured to statically install routes as well. A common example is a default route or "all zeros" route. One solution would be to run a dynamic routing protocol across R0 and R1. Another solution would be to manually configure static routes on R0 and R1. Static Routes 

My non-EE-background stab at an answer is: I don't believe fiber was initially looked at as a transmission medium purely for bandwidth reasons, but more for the fact that it [light] can travel much longer distances without amplification/regeneration, and the fact that it's immune to factors that electrical transmission mediums are not immune to, like noise for example. The higher bandwidth rates are a product of engineering done at the PHY level - I'm not sure if you're familiar with WDM technology, but basically it multiplexes light at various wavelengths to increase the total capacity of a single fiber pair - this gives you a higher aggregated bandwidth, but each wavelength still has a max of 10G (disclaimer: I'm not up on optical engineering news so it's possible that you can get higher rates per wavelength). There are certainly specs for (and maybe even small deployments of) 10G over copper, typically over what's called "direct attach" cables - they're twinax copper cables with SFP's on either side. There are also QSFP's which are 40G capable, but these will typically have one QSFP on one end and break out into 4 10G cables on the other end. 

They have described the technology ("a really long Ethernet cable") pretty accurately. Typically transport in this case is referring to "lit services" by a provider. The technologies used will vary widely depending on a number of factors, including the provider, the geographic area, etc. but the most common instances I've seen are the following: 1) The provider gives you an Ethernet handoff/presentation (typically fiber, but sometimes copper) and then they will carry your signal across their backbone by turning it into a *WDM (not necessarily the technology used, but it's probably the most common) signal on their network, and then they'll spit it back out to you as another Ethernet handoff at the other site. 2) If the two locations are geographically close enough, the provider may not bother with using *WDM and carry it across their metro Ethernet backbone either as a VLAN or pseudowire service such as a VLL - this is frequently used for peering if an exchange or entity is in one colocation and the entity wanting to peer is not in that same colocation facility, but they are in another one that's very geographically close. Contrast this with "unlit" services (usually offered by a provider that has a lot of fiber in the ground already) where the responsibility to light the "wave", as we call them in the industry, falls on you and you alone - these are commonly used in conjunction with WDM deployments because you get more for your money out of the dark fiber. Regarding the technology and how it works, CWDM and DWDM are just ways to multiplex multiple signals (called 'channels' or wavelengths) over a single fiber pair. You get more channels per pair out of DWDM vs. CWDM, but CWDM is always cheaper to build and deploy. WDM technologies are strictly layer 1 and are protocol agnostic, so it's entirely possible to carry Ethernet and SONET traffic on the same WDM metro ring.
