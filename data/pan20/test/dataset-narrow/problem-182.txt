Transceiver Rx optical power = -3.9 dBm, looks to be within acceptable parameters. "show int te0/0/0 transceiver detail" will confirm if DOM is supported on the chassis. Transceiver is a SFP+ so it supports DOM. Are you doing a long haul back to XO's location or did XO bring in something a Cisco ONS 15454 on premise to drop off a local 10g interface to you? If so then they probably used an SR on their side. Need to confirm if XO is using an LR model on their end. I see the link type forced-up and also see that flowcontrol for both in & out are on. Are you hard coding everything on the port config or allowing to auto neg with the XO end? Need to find out if XO is hardcoding their end. If hard coded on your end and not theirs I would set duplex, speed to auto and turn off flow control and see if the link starts passing traffic. I doubt XO has changed default flowcontrols, speed, duplex settings on their end from the install techs I know at XO. Never know though, anything is possible. Also as Ron mentioned. Transceivers and fiber all need to match and be correct first and foremost. 

No much information in your question how you currently have the switch configured L2/L3 or both, but a quick answer is you aren't really stacking this model as it's not a stackable model. (stackables have only one IP address to manage the stack) You can daisy chain them together using one of the four ports on the front right side and configure as a trunk port on the existing and new switch. Can be technically done with any port but suggest one of the four. Or you can use one of the open SFP slots and buy two fiber modules. Part number# MGBSX1 "1000BASE-SX SFP transceiver, for multimode fiber, 850 nm wavelength" and a 50 micron fiber patch cord between switches. Assuming in the same rack located together a 1-3 meter cable will do. On most Cisco models if you use one of the SFP ports the the associated copper port is not usable. All of the ports on the down stream switch are sharing the one uplink to the up stream switch. If this is a small office with mostly internet and low bandwidth traffic then this isn't a problem. Again the ports are either configured as defaults and the two connecting ports between the switches will auto negotiate a link. But if an engineer has made changes to the default config then the link might not come up and spanning tree will shutdown the port. Best to find a local network engineer that works with Cisco products and consult with them for the greatest success. 

Your question title says SG300 and the posted question says SG3000. If you google "cisco sg300 firmware" it takes you directly to the download pages. You can download the code for your model from here. $URL$ 

wireshark for supports circular logging and circular buffering. If you wanting one line of trace for a port to generate a new file then you are going to make the file size setting super small. Not sure what the minimum support file size is. Would have to set the wireshark to filter down to only capturing the desired port. That part is not hard. I would imagine it can be done with some experimenting. Too board a subject for this post. www.wireshark.org. Most linux repositories have wireshark available for download. If it's a headless server then it will be more work to get the start config tweaked with the right parameters. Good luck. 

This is an older Cisco page that I wished was kept current. Has many of the Cisco products but not always the latest and greatest. $URL$ One thing to keep in mind that I haven't seen mention is you can go through the entire Cisco mib universe but if the mib you are wanting to use isn't installed in the IOS that the switch running you will only be spinning your wheels. For example you mention the 3560 model. If you had 12.2.50 train of code this is the supported mibs. ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/supportlists/cat3560/cat3560-supportlist.htm If you had 15.x code train then the mibs will be a different mix. You have to look up the release notes/data sheets for each code build if you are going to deep dive into off beat mibs. The standards based and Cisco generic mibs are generally always in the vast majority of the code trains. Been there, done that with scripts trying to extract specific OID's to only later discover that the mib isn't in the switch. Really problematic for DHCP stats and environmental stats. Also are you wanting the GUI to show blinking lights? snmp queries are snapshots in time depending on the OID queried. If your wanting to keep up with the constant state of the lights then you will be polling non stop which will drive the cpu to 100% and stay there. Not that hard to drive a 3560 cpu into the ground from personal experiences with snmp polling. Just some things to keep in mind. Good luck. 

In the "show snmp" traps are being generated, 13 of them, and you have snmp-server enable traps syslog set. Few things you can do is add a logging ip address if one doesn't already exist or an additional address and throw up a simple syslog server and do a few things to generate traps like conf t or add a vlan and delete a vlan as you have these set to trap. If you don't to use vlans then add a loopback and shut/no shut it a few times. Appears you are dealing with these remotely. I always open two sessions to the box. Session one, I execute "no debug all" then arrow up then switch to the other session and do term mon and then debug snmp packet. The first session is a failsafe so I can turn off debugging with hitting return if for some reason debug is taxing the box. School of remote access hard knocks. While debug is running do conf t and exit a few times and/or add delete vlans and you will see the traps being generated and if they are pointing to the desired ip. Should see something similar to these below. 

More info would help like a simple diagram of where the pc's mention live and what online tool you are using. The online tool, is it just looking up the assign dns ip address or actually pinging from the tool website? If just entering the domain name and the site is spitting out the ip address then it is just doing a lookup which good. When you ping from the command line are you ping the dns name or the ip assigned to the NAT? Are you just getting timeouts from the pc and if so is is showing the correct ip to dns mapping? If all of those are correct it's possible an ACL has been added/changed to prevent ping responses in the firewall. Do you have access to the logs from the DMZ firewall? If you tried traceroute to the address what hop is if failing? If possible what does an nslookup from the pc/workstation show? I would also load NMap and run a sweep on the host in question and see if ports are found regardless if they are open or closed. Post some screen captures or logs so others can chime in as well. 

Second the postings of the other gents. I would avoid media converters for a single run fiber between devices. Another point of failure from the school of hard knocks. Most GigE to fiber converters are generally inexpensive devices that if they go offline on the fiber side can't report the link down unless it supports snmp polling or traps. Of all of the CWDM and DWDM devices I worked with all of the wave lengths for Tx go down one fiber and all of the Rx go down the other. The only time I use single strand fiber is for video transmission gear which is the normal for SDI protocols. Stick with switches that have sfp slots and try and purchase sfp's and switches that support DOM "digital optical monitoring" so you can get power level stats. DOM can be a lifesaver troubleshooting tool. Media converters are fine if your just going from a copper switch port out to an LED street sign that doesn't get updated often or isn't mission critical. Every customer that I have worked with that had media converters eventually pulled them out over troubleshooting lacking information. fwiw. 

I will suggest if you are comfortable that there is no firewall running on the server or it has the ports allowed and no ACL's on switches in between the server and client that deny these ports is to run NMap on the client side against the server. Default is first thousand ports plus well known ports, add -p 1-45003 and verify that the desired ports don't show (closed). Will take a little longer to scan the additional port range. Hopefully the port will show what app NMap thinks is running on 8833 and 45002 and that they are open. RST is usually the results of a broken conservation and one side says I don't like it and sends a reset to tear-down the conservation. 

This switch went end of sales in Aug 2003 and the af spec wasn't fully ratified until 2003. So it's most likely pre af standard which Cisco supported based on af drafts. I've never had a problem with the pre AF Cisco devices not working. Will work fine with most inline power products with Caveats. Show power doesn't have anything to do with show power inline, two different areas of the switch. If you are wanting the most trouble free setting then enter power inline auto. Will auto negotiate the power level to a max of 15.4w per port up to a max 325w on a 24 port model. From experience if you are doing this specifically for VoIP phones you can run into problems depending on the IOS. Newer ip phones will want LLDP-MED TLV extension protocol support which won't be in a switch this old. At best the switch will have CDP TLV but possibly not the TLV needed. On some models you can manually build the CDP-TLV list and save. That's before you end get to weak QoS support in switch for phones. If you are just doing dumb devices like PoE IP security cameras then the switch will work just fine. Will end up around 6.8w per camera. 

Appears there is no physical compactflash module in slot 0, appears to have on in slot 1 with at a minimum a corrupted file system and at a max bad physical flash as you are getting file system sector error and the storage areas are corrupted. Can't write the crashdump file and that is why you get the repeated reboots after 5 minutes. If control break is enabled then after the first few seconds after power on you can hit control break and dump out to the rommon prompt: May have to type flash_init to activate the file system, type set to see where it is pointing to for the ios file then type dir flash1: and see if it can read the file system. If you have access to the ios from either a backup or from another 3925 copy it to a usb stick and put in the usb flash slots if your model has them. I believe it does. I try and use 1gb sticks and smaller. Not all Cisco routers will accept the larger sticks. From the rommon prompt: type usbflash0 or 1 depending on which slot you put it in and see if the router can see the stick and the files. If so you can boot off of the usb stick. prompt: boot usbflash0:file name and hit return. If the rest of the router hardware is good then it will boot up without a config. May get a few errors go by because the rommon set is pointing to the bad flash for the config and license file but will come up if hardware is good. Best you can hope for at that point. You may be able to reformat the flash file system. If you have licensed any features when the router was purchased you will need the license file to turn on more than the base default license. Definitely either corrupted file system or bad flash. 

Your original question, for me anyway, doesn't tell me if you are the end user managing a wan or small provider or developing a monitoring product. snmp and TR069 are completely unrelated to each other in method, protocols and ports used. Can't compare to each other. snmp probe is just that, a node be it a server, or pc on the inside polling all of the desired devices gathering information that it then forwards on to the central collector. In your case that is the cloud server. Snmp can be setup to poll the wan port of the public ip devices but that is up to each device to support. Really only something I would consider if the public ip's are static and I have ACL's protecting what can snmp poll the devices wan ports. Can be done with dynamic dns but but can be problematic if the the device gets handed an updated ip then there is lag until dynamic dns updates. Again the CPE has to support dynamic dns. You asked for links to documentation that more fully explains what your MSO mention. This link includes diagrams and links to the specific RFC's. $URL$ Good Luck.
