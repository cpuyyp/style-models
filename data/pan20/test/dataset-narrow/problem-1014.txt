I just wanted to update this: Google has now added about 30 new themes to their page, under the artist tab. Some are really good, some aren't but at least we have more choices. 

I have the airline plugin installed for vim and no matter which theme I pick there is always an orange arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen. How can I fix this? 

This has been a feature request in Ubuntu for a while now. As of yet their is no official support, but there is a work around: a) Export to PDF in OpenOffice. b) Use pdfnup to print multiple pages per sheet. 

I been trying to convert my HTML file to MediaWiki format by exporting it using OpenOffice. I keep getting this error message though: 

Try to use a plain USB2.0 flash drive. Many older (and current) UEFI/BIOSes get confused with USB3.0 drives. 

As I understand the specs for "Rocket Socket" charger, it can do 12V with 3.5 A, but at 19V it can do only 2 A. So yes, if you attach the Dallas ID chip from Dell 19V 4.62A adapter to the center wire, the laptop will think that it has the PA-10 power adapter, and will try to suck up to 4.62 A, thus overloading the "Rocket-Socket" by more than twice. The likely effect will be either the voltage will drop below 10V, or it will smoke out. The advice - don't do this, or get a more powerful power supply. But again, why go for such a trouble if the original DELL 90W 19V/4.62A adapters are well under $10 even on Amazon? Regarding programming or emulaing the ID chip, there were some attempts to do so. But again, does the trouble worth it? 

It will turn my screen off, then back on. So I'm thinking that maybe my script isn't getting called. 

I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 and when listening to music I usually just turn the volume up and down with the buttons on my PC. Tonight however, I found out that my headphones I've had for 3 years broke (only the right speaker was working because of a short), so I open volume control and adjusted it so that it would send all sound to the right speaker. Now whenever I play music without my headphones and try to change the volume with the buttons on my computer it does absolutely nothing. Is there a way I can reset the default values for the volume control? 

Obviously "ESD" has nothing to do with anything here. To begin, I would advise to clear up CMOS and start with fail-safe defaults. Sometimes BIOS/UEFI store some wrong configuration internally, which can prevent PC from normal booting. First, disconnect your PSU from AC outlet. Wait. Then remove CR2032 CMOS battery. Then short battery terminals with a piece of wire or tweezers. Hold the short for few seconds to ensure that all elements in the CMOS power rails are discharged. (nowadays a voltage as small as 0.6V might keep information in CMOS memory). Then restore CMOS battery, and try to start your PC. If successfull, you will boot into BIOS/UEFI setup, where you should find a way to set default or fail-safe configuration. (Some mainboards do have some jumper to clear CMOS, but I prefer explicit power discharge) 

Which I placed in a folder called: and titled the script , but it doesn't seem to get called after standby. If I just type: 

I want to have both of my scrollbar buttons at the bottom like the way it is on a mac. How can I do this in Ubuntu? I know some themes support it but I was wondering if there was a way to make this permanent for all themes. 

BABUN: You should take a look at Babun! I'm a Linux guy and this is the first program I install on my Windows machines. It's a very nice redux of cygwin and installing it is as simple as any other .msi installer. By default the shell is zsh, which I love, but you can easily change that to bash and bash comes preinstalled with Babun as well. 

An USB enclosure with SATA hard drive isn't a simple system. It contains a complex "bridge" between USB interface and SATA interface. For this mass storage device to be ready for USB transactions, the bridge usually contains a serious MCU, which does basic SATA configuration by itself and builds proper data tables about attached disk capabilities/formats etc. in a suitable USB Mass Storage Class format. This includes power management. Below is an example of USB3-SATA bridge produced by Fujitsu: 

USB 2.0 makes signaling over two wires, D+ and D-. When a USB device is plugged in, it pulls up one of the wires with 1.5 k pull-up. 

It looks like you have a proprietary "creative card" interface in your sewing machine, and a "creative card" to usb adapter. From Pfaff data sheets and troubleshooting area, it looks like it is a COM port interface, which would likely require some settings in the Device Manager of your PC. If the COM port is not configured properly, there will be no communications. Please read connection instructions carefully, or contact Pfaff support for help, they are still in business. 

I've had this problem on my laptop for sometime now. Anytime I try to use my touchpad it works correctly about 60% of the time in Windows, the other 40% of the time, it will jump to a random spot on the screen. It has had this problem in Windows XP, Vista, and 7! I did clean installs of each OS. Now heres where it gets weird, when I switch to Ubuntu 9.04, my touchpad works fine 100% of the time. Is there some way I can fix this? 

I'm just wondering if there are any unofficial Google Chrome Themes that I can easily install (eg. don't have to copy a .dll to the themes folder)? I would like to be able to click apply theme (just like you can on Google's Official Themes page). Do any exist? 

The enclosure says for 2.5" IDE drives. The 2.5" formfactor of HDDs is intended for use in laptops, where the major peripheral power is 5V DC. Therefore it is very likely that the external power source is 5V, and much less likely to be 12V. You can do two things. First connect the enclosure to 5V wall AC adaper (or into anything 5V) with at least 2A rating, and see if will start working. Usually lower voltage will not harm devices designed for 12V. Second, open the enclosure and find the DC power requirements written on the drive itself. If it lists only "DC+5V 0.7A" or something, it is definitely for a 5V external supply. For more confidence, check if the USB bridge board has any additional small chips surrounded by sizeable inductors and sizeable caps in the vicinity of power jack. There should be something like a small 5V-3.3V LDO to power the main IC, but not any switching power supply for 12V-5V DC-DC conversion. Also, this kind of old devices usually came with a special Y-split cable, to use two USB ports as a beefed-up power supply. Keep in mind that the spin-up phase of old IDE HDDs might need about 1.8-2A of current for first several seconds, and if the VBUS voltage droops during the start, the electronics might fail to initialize the drive properly, and there will be no USB connection. 

I really hate the Google Chrome Dev warning that opens every time I use Google Chrome on Linux. Is there anyway to disable it. 

Is there anyway I can change a shortcut key that an application has under one of it's menus in Ubuntu. For example I'm running and want it to clear the window when I press CtrlL. 

My Compaq Presario laptop hard drive has failed (luckily I was prepared). Now I want to refurbish this machine for another use. I'm going to need a new hard drive and was wondering where I could get the cheapest model. I don't need a big hard drive (just big enough to run Ubuntu). That means anything bigger than 15 GB's will do just fine. I need an IDE (PATA) hard drive. Where can I get the cheapest one that is bigger than 15 GBs? 

How about to unplug your Wi-Fi router from AC? :-) Also, doesn't configuration of your router allow to schedule Wi-Fi activity? 

For most PCs the USB VBUS power on ROOT ports does not have any high-side hardware switches to control VBUS, thus there is no means to turn the VBUS on/off by software. The VBUS is connected nearly directly to system's PS, to +5VSB (standby) rail, so even if the PC is turned off, VBUS stays. This is done this way so a keyboard or mouse can wake the PC up. (Laptops are somewhat different, it depends). Therefore, you have three options: (1) Use a good (certified and expensive) hub with ports that have high-side switches to connect to your COM devices. When PC reboots, new enumeration cycle for USB hub will have USB_RESET state, and high-side switches will turn off and then on. It might be not easy to find this kind of hub, since manufacturers usually have stuffing options on their PCBs either to use high-side switches (adding cost), or bypass them with resettable polyfuse (cheap) at assembly point. (2) Use a separate controlled power source like this SPDT USB-controlled switch between USB port and your equipment. (3) Fix your COM-port equipment and/or host driver to implement "reset/initialize" protocol. 

So I have a Dell Inspiron 1526 that has a broadcom bcm4312 wireless card. I installed Ubuntu and (big surprise) the wireless card isn't working. No problem for a hot shot like me who has fixed this same problem before on my old laptop. Just install bc43xx-fwcutter and install the firmware, well it didn't work. Needless to say I've been googleing for more than an hour and I'm tuff out of luck. So how can I get this to work? Oh, one minor note: I don't have anyway to connect to the internet on said computer because all I have is wireless that is being pick upped from across the street (no ethernet), but I do have another computer that can connect.
