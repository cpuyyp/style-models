Send a message to support@messagelabs.com, you should include the email address of your recipient, maybe they will work with you, don't know. It will probably help them if you include the complete original message, (extract the .eml file and zip it) 

If you have ILO or similar, you should be able to attach a CD/DVD ROM remotely (works great btw) What OS was on the drive? This page: $URL$ Suggests formatting will help, else, there is a registry change that may help. (for vista, but they haven't changed much) 

You should be able to configure RRAS to relay DHCP from your DHCP server, that way all the dns suffix's that you have configured locally would be propagated. Routing and Remote Access -> server name -> IP Routing -> General Right-click General, and then click New Routing Protocol. In the Select Routing Protocol dialog box, click DHCP Relay Agent, and then click OK. Edit that new DHCP Relay Agent object, and add the IP address of the DHCP server. Then, Right-click on server name and select the IP tab, choose DHCP, ok! Works a charm. 

If you read the /etc/tripwire/twcfg.txt file, you might be forgiven for thinking you can just add your emailserver's details there.. however that doesn't work. One quick final step, might want to add your email address as an alias for root, so you get roots email! 

$URL$ Don't know what your problem is, it could be the ports are wrong, your firewall is blocking it, your IMAP connector is off, your test account is locked out, g-standard-edition-restrictions, might need fully qualified name (user@domain.com). You could ask google, those fellas are usually pretty switched on: $URL$ 

It is up to the firewall to determine which traffic can flow in which direction, if you haven't configured any outbound rules, then, by default it will probably allow all outbound connections. "In the case of malware" is separate, as that can only be determined by the PC itself. (Unless you invest in a N/IDS). There are ways of preventing outbound traffic unless a human is involved, see $URL$ 

Or, if you just need it for a few, (and you saved it in the NETLOGON folder above) simply edit the user account (Profile Tab -> Logon Script textbox) and enter the filename. 

If you are wanting to have several/many users accessing, you will need some form of fanout, like his previous page.. handy! 

Then configure the server to determine whether to modify the header or not based on destination domain: 

Pretty sure, you can then just manage your clients from within the LDAP database, with all the API's that work with it for automating MAC->IP lookups etc.. Each DHCP server can refer to the LDAP global database for single-point-of-contact administration. 

...then say yes to the confirmation request - switch will reboot with no config information....no username/password/IPaddress etc etc. According to this thread on the dell forums, you will need: an RS-232 crossover cable 

How did you configure the basic auth? If you are using Directives, try changing to instead. (as the proxied requests don't actually touch an Apache directory.. Edit: I assume you have: 

According to this site: $URL$ PEAR should already be installed, just shy. A few vhosts config changes and you're off. Unless PHP has been compiled without PEAR, then no, its probably never going to work unless you reinstall it, or get your hosting provider to do so. 

Its called a "Mandatory Profile": $URL$ Apply whatever settings you want to the profile, rename the .dat to .man, then, when creating accounts in future (or modify existing), set the "Profile" field in the accounts properties to that profile's directory. (The link above shows how to set this path) 

You'd be looking for the "Credential Manager" which can really only be run locally: You can start it from the command line: 

You can use GPO's in a windows domain to configure proxy settings. Also, use the PAC suggestion, but with DNS autoconfig, setup an A record for WPAD.mydomain, pointing to a local webserver that contains a file called wpad.dat (a copy of proxy.pac) in the web root. Any browser configured with "Automatically configure my proxy settings" or "automatic" or whatever will find this and work. Then only allow your proxy at the gateway. Works a charm! (then laptop users can still connect at home/o'seas etc) It is also a DHCP option. More info: $URL$ (needed for mime settings) 

Maybe my "comment" slipped you by, but my point is this: You can't access the POP service via the IMAP port number, Exchange replies based on the port you specify. To access POP, usually you have to use port 110. If that port isn't being forwarded by your gateway, then you might have to configure it to do so. It should be relatively safe to allow the gmail IP ranges (below), rather than every IP. 

What Zoredache said, except, if that account is for a Domain Admin, simply add them to the correct security group and they should be able to logon. 

In the previous incarnation (IIS6), you could specify which IP's were allowed, and deny everything else, per site.. $URL$ Sort of shows how to do that on IIS7.. (not sure, don't have one lying around to test) Assuming your users would be from the same subnets it should work... 

EDIT: Now its back: (And you can see there are 4 drives in there, 1 hot-spare, didn't notice Drive0 was missing before) 

Note, multiple RewriteCond directives are implicitly AND'd, you need to specify if they should be OR'd instead. If you want the browser to remember the redirection, specifying a permanent redirection might save some future processing. Depending on your config, it might be easier to specify the Known Good ranges and redirect for everyone else. From the rewrite manual on redirecting foreigners: Apache Manual 

Locate the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog Click the subkey that represents the event log that you want to move, for example, click Application. In the right pane, double-click File. Type the complete path to the new location (including the log file name) in the Value data box, and then click OK. For example, if you want to move the application log (Appevent.evt) to the Eventlogs folder on the E drive, type e:\eventlogs\appevent.evt. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each log file that you want to move. Click Exit on the Registry menu. Restart the computer. 

(This installed bsd-mailx, exim4, exim4-base, exim4-config and exim4-daemon-light Ran through prompts to setup tripwire passwords etc Then ran: 

So there, no changes made to firewall (no need to open ports as we are only sending, not receiving email) and the mta only exists to send tripwire reports. Now we can start tripwire: 

The procedure is outlined here: $URL$ Quoted: To move Event Viewer log files to another location on the hard disk, follow these steps: 

You will have to probably disable integrated authentication for that subfolder, as IIS sees that setting and tries it first, which it does by sending an auth request, basically a fail message to the browser.. your ajax script probably isn't testing for that fail, so doesn't know to send the data again. 

I just have a button that reports the error to IT.. if users are stupid enough to push it for pr0n they get nailed.. I suppose you could use the same variables to populate a local php/perl function that modifies the acl, reloads the config and waits for cron to switch it back.. 

Is the default gateway the same on the ubuntu box and the exchange box? The *.local will not be addressable from "outside", I assume you are using another domain name externally, will this not play havoc with your virtual hosts? (expecting *.local getting *.corp.com will break functionality, but you should get some response) 

It was a faulty drive, check the physical box for failure lights, replace, wait for rebuild, should be good. 

You could write something similar using vbs/batch for windows. Then, use a neat little program: squid-report.pl (davehope.co.uk) to monitor the day's or week's logs, find the most used sites, or largest downloads etc, add the ones you don't want to the block list. Doesn't take much effort. Eventually (with custom error messages per acl, squid is great for that, I have a link that sends an email to me if you click it, so users can report errors with one click) you can train your staff not to visit porn/game sites at work. And, blocking ad's saves so much bandwidth and increases response! I find sqstat handy for "Realtime" monitoring.. $URL$ Great for finding out who is listening to internet radio and wasting bandwidth! Then, for your "Reports", you can use SARG: $URL$ Fantastic program, shows When/Who/What/Where the users were doing online.. ;-) 

You can Debug BEX using the SGMon utility, it is in the program directory.. however, it has quite extensive output.. You can also create smaller jobs, and run them sequentially, or, to back them up to a "folder" first, then run a "duplicate" backup job to tape. If it fails on the folder job, its a network/source issue, if it fails on the tape, its a drive[r]/tape issue. One of our servers started to do something like this, we got the drive itself replaced ASAP, problem solved. 

The one with 0.0.0.0 as the destination is your default route. You can leave this alone, and just add a static route to your LAN network, over your LAN interface. This will allow you to use the 3G device for internet traffic. Route print should also show you the interface table: 

I am actually getting a few errors in the IIS space about my mapped drive.. $URL$ Obviously, its shared as: s$ So its hidden from casual browsers, but, the request is actually making it to the webserver, which is rewriting the request as a above. (drupal ya know) So, if you have a similar setup (IIS) you should be seeing requests for anything that isn't an actual share, and probably for those too, end up in your IIS logfiles. 

Yes, IIS can support running numerous simultaneous frameworks. .NET/ASP/PHP/SSI/ISAPI etc.. You just have to enable them. $URL$ 

then just cron between them as needed.. when you are up to 100% relayed, switch your app to the new server. 

I haven't found any iLO/DRAC interfaces on the back of the box, and I've only been here for a few weeks, so still struggling to adapt to ESX's weird ways. Why is IC showing 8 drive faults? I can't find anything about this online.. I thought I was good at googling! 

You could try turning off usermode caching at the IIS end: IIS7: $URL$ IIS6: $URL$ That way, if there is any "transparent" proxy in between, you will be able to control it.. somewhat. 

There are two main ways, pay someone else to do it for you, do it yourself. You can get MessageLabs to filter your 'net for ya, cost a bit, but you get to specify what they can see using checkboxes, and you get lovely reports for your boss's at the end of the week/month emailed directly to ya. $URL$ Or; You can create your own acl's (I use a short bash script to append my acl's and reinit squids config (below)) and maintain them based on your users own actual usage. 

If you create a local account in that group, with the same username & password, the user in question probably won't realise that its not on the domain until they try and use domain resources from that machine.. its best to just have it on the domain. Is there any reason for its "non-domain" stasis?
