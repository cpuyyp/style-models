what do you mean here.. If all computers on an entire network were physically connected with a wire.. then I guess you wouldn't need a switch or router. What you're describing sounds a bit like original ethernet.. and if they're all connected with a wire it would likely not be such a big network. And anyhow it won't be a wire like you are used to. It'd have computers connected along the way to it with "taps". So I don't know why you just threw that sentence in. 

I am accessing a computer elsewhere in the house that is on black screensaver.. i'd like to be able to access it without the screen changing. From time to time I just need to access it and save some open unsaved documents, but i'd like to retain a black screen. suggestions involving other remote viewing apps are welcome.. black screen is important. 

ADDED NOTE- You say yours originally would go quiet after 10 seconds. So that sounds like it may just be a setting (for you) But there are reviews talking about noisy fans and also some ways to address them. One review mentions a firmware update, another replacing fans. 

and here are some tests that shows that regex works. I had put them into my question when I solved it but I should have put them into an answer. Total Hex Chars 85 

I suppose in this case not defined means no network fields and host bit fields which is what you say you read, which makes sense and I think that's what the wikipedia page really meant when it said undefined. There are also going to be some addresses that IANA never assigned..but no doubt some multi-cast addresses were given out. I don't know if you'd call the whole thing a network address. Network address is normally an address ending in .0 representing the subnet. I don't think a multi-cast address is referred to as a network address. 

With ones i've used, NAT and DHCP definitely aren't done when it's in bridge mode, I can't comment on others. I'd be surprised if it did wireless but you can check just to make 100% sure.. If you know the SSID (which you'd need to know to know how to connect to your own router when it's in regular mode), then look for that SSID to see if it's broadcasting. I'm sure you'll find that's off too, in any of these devices when in bridge mode. I suppose you could also prove that it's not doing NAT, with the tracert command tracert www.google.com and look for private IP addresses like 192.168 or 10.0 and you should only see one of them, if double NAT I suppose you'd see two. Note I have edited my answer, my previous answer said "When it's in bridge mode it has no web interface, no IP." I removed that since it's false for DDWRT and possibly false for some makes/models. The other answer says no , however that's not true either. I know this to be the case(the web interface turning off when in bridging mode), with some router/modem/switches, specifically with at least some, belkin ones e.g. $URL$ as mentioned here "if the belkin is correctly set to bridge mode you can not enter its gui web interface , as it is just a modem". It is true of DDWRT that you can still access the web interface.. Though quite likely that his particular make/model can, as the other answer claims to have used similar models to the OP, and says you can, i.e. you can with his. Though the other answer then talks about DDWRT which the OP may not be running. And the other answer doesn't specify what is going on with the OP's device if he has no access to his web interface. 

When you drag a shortcut onto the taskbar, and it makes a new icon appear there, "pinned" to the taskbar, it is creating a new shortcut. The proof of this, is you can delete the shortcut you dragged, and the shortcut on the taskbar will still be there. And you can shift right click the shortcut on the taskbar, and go to properties.. ignore the shortcut tab, go to the general tab and in the location box it says C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar or if you want to copy and paste the whole thing. %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar Why the path says "internet explorer" is anybody's guess, but that's where the taskbar shortcuts are 

Then I go to ge.tt and click to bring up the standard upload screen I have tried this in FF or Chrome, same issue. 

NT(e.g. XP) is not like Win 9X so it won't just work when you do that. If wanting to move a computer from CompA to CompB when the motherboard has a different chipset. A)XP Repair Installation on B after the act. (i'm not sure if Win XP SP3 has repair installation) $URL$ B)Acronis has an option to make an image that can be written to a different comp. C)There are ways to treat Win XP on CompA so that it transfers. One way is changing an entry in device manager. Another way is changing the HAL Raymond mentions a way to treat it on CompA,, and a way to treat it after, on CompB. $URL$ $URL$ Personally though i've only done A. The xp repair installation after. 

So perhaps you can explain if that's what you want.. say if you are not getting that. Give screenshots of what you are getting, and we'll see exactly what the problem is. Maybe your problem is a setting isn't sticking for some reason. Show it with screenshots. 

If you want to get to safe mode and F8 isn't getting anything, another way to do it would be to edit boot.ini with a Win XP PE CD, and add /SAFEBOOT 

row 2 will match. As it's on the same network. It matches anything that starts 183.77.42 A packet comes in or is generated locally. This isn't the full formula, but it's sufficient to answer the main thing in your question. The formula that routing will use is to look at the destination IP of that packet. AND it with the netmask, send it out the specified Interface, addressed to the Gateway(router) specified. Absolutely any packet will match the first row. So there might be something that causes that row to be tested last e.g. I think it's that it has the most 1s in the netmask. If those are the same then Metric is a thing that affects which row is looked at first. So in this case metric isn't relevant. The last row listed (dest 255.255.255.255) is I the one tested first as it has the most 1s in the netmask.. It tests to see if the IP is destined to a broadcast address. i.e. it tests to see if the destination IP = 255.255.255.255 It does that by ANDing the address with 255.255.255.255 which is all 1s, and maintains the IP as is, then it tests to see if it matches 255.255.255.255. The row 3, is testing for a destination of an IP which is clearly a gateway itself. The mask is 255.255.255.255 so the IP comes in, it is maintained as is and see if it equals that .18 address. If it does then, for whatever reason, it doesn't get sent out, it just gets sent to what's called the loopback interface, which is 127/8 e.g. 127.0.0.1 which is essentially an internal virtual interface, within the machine itself. Row 2 is very important, it means if the destination IP is on the same network then send it out. And Row 1 is very important, it would probably run last.. it matches absolutely anything. And sends it out. So if something matched before it then that row won't apply to it. 

added clarification and if anybody finds the above rather hard to understand with the arrows and descriptions, and prefers no english and just a screenshot, here is a link to such a screenshot, it shows just the main part of what is above. 

Now open a cmd prompt, then run java -version and hopefully is 1.6 And no you won't get errors having 2 java versions. It'd only use one or the other. 

Restarting your machine might have stopped the connection to the server and you need to start the server again. Or set it to run when windows starts, typically done by setting it to run as a service in windows. It's rare that restarting a computer would cause you to get a new IP. Restarting a Router might. But a Computer, wouldn't. The only case that springs to mind, is if you have a DSL Modem Card, then your ISP might assign you another IP Why don't you restart your machine and see if your IP actually changes? Are you sure that your IP changed? You should check your IP while connected, and after restarting your computer (run the IPCONFIG command from the cmd prompt). See if it changes. If it doesn't, then this problem has nothing to do wit dynamic and static IPs. There are servies others have mentioned like DYNDNS, where you don't get a static IP, but you get a Domain name, and that points to your dynamic IP. Your computer or your router have a feature or software that send your IP to the dyndns people and the IP associated with the domain gets updated to your latest IP, and people just access the domain(which doesn't change). 

If the first column is A, and then there is a comma, and there is whatever in the second column, it replaces the lot with A,D. This will only happen when it matches A in the first column(followed by a comma and whatever in the second column). An example with a file This turns your example into your result. So, where your first column is A, your second column becomes D. 

Note- In retrospect, reading the question again, this doesn't do what is asked. Since, while it does link two processes together, (in an interesting way that would even work over a network!), it doesn't link both ways. 

That checks all the boxes. Then I saw the remove button wasn't enabled.. I manually clicked and unclicked the first checkbox which enabled the remove button. Then of course clicked the remove button and problem solved. All items listed in that history search, are removed. 

And you can use to check that before the command nothing is running on port 4321, and after it, there is a server listening. 

or even more manually, to break the command down A$ then on B, make sure ~/.ssh exists then do and you can cat authorized_keys of B before and after to make sure the key is listed. Or you could email id_rsa.pub to an email account, then from B, B can check the email and append the contents of id_rsa.pub into his authorized_keys file automatically The ssh-copy-id command You need to be able to ssh in, so you need password access Instead of doing ssh user@host you do ssh-copy-id user@host and you are prompted for a password, you enter it, you're in, it will copy the public key over. And next time you do ssh user@host it will use the key. 

On VMware workstation, when I boot a VM I see a screen appear for booting CD but it doesn't last long. I definitely try hitting F2 when I see it, and i'm a very fast guy, still no luck. How do I do it? 

so you mean putting aside that idea of all computers connected with a wire with no router. And no, even in your home set up, they don't go through the router every time. Even with your "home router" , call it an internet box. They go to the switch in it. 

that looks about right I suppose You might be ok with a blank user path, but the machine path should have that. So if you go to that key (easy with the sysinternals tool regjump 

This has nothing to do with windows 7 or ubuntu or multi-boot or grub. You're simply not managing to get into the BIOS. In your case, when you don't manage to get into the BIOS, the next thing is grub but that is not very relevant. If you took the hard drives out completely and tried to get into the BIOS then Grub wouldn't come up. All that nonsense about windows 7 and ubuntu and grub and multiboot is all irrelevant. And you didn't even mention trying keys other than F12 like F2 or DEL. 

The device you are looking for is called a KVM Extender It lets you have a Monitor(the 'Video' in KVM), Keyboard and Mouse. And the Computer can be put at a distance with a cable. It's also good if your computer is noisy - you can shut it away. You may also want a KVM Switch, that lets you have one Monitor, keyboard and mouse, and multiple computers. 

That did seem to remove blank lines, there may be a way around that with batch, but another way, besides batch, is to use sed. 

In this case Stalling includes an IO element that i'm not used to. I think it's still one single cycle though perhaps not necessarily a processor FE cycle. but one cycle of processor and IO operation. Time period relates to one cycle, always. 

A reviewer of that device posts this solution to the problem $URL$ Check reviews for people discussing the issue. Here is one listed there. I notice he has an H80i though his review appwars on a page discussing the H100i. And it may apply. $URL$ 

I'd just amend that last word to "client". Users aren't relevant, it's all about the computers. Users just facilitate the communication of the computers! The server can use the IP to send it to the right computer(the client computer). It got a packet it sees the source IP of the packet it got and it can write that in as the dest IP when it sends the packet out. Toomgo points out in his comment, that a process can start many "conversations". The client port will identify which conversation that packet is part of. You write 

Is there an extension in Chrome that letsm e have a drop down menu for multiple tabs. As it becomes difficult when there are too many tabs like once it gets over 25-30 they start to blank out. 

A second graphics card or if you don't mind the same thing on both screens, then a VGA splitter. I want to bring up an important point that others have missed regarding your use of the term CPU. In old textbooks, the term CPU did indeed refer to the box. But it's a bit of an ambiguous term, because since then people have used the term to mean processor, and that's a more common usage. And most people aren't aware of the old usage of CPU to mean the box. So you could just call the thing you're calling a CPU, a/the box.(e.g. the case + what's in it). e.g. people refer to windows boxes. And call a processor a processor rather than a CPU.. That way you can avoid the term CPU entirely because it's ambiguous.. But know that when people use the term CPU, they usually mean processor and aren't aware of any other meaning of it. 

It doesn't matter what text blahbla is. find replace with \1 The part in the round brackets of the find, is your x/..../... pattern, that you want to retain. gives 

There may be a newer method , using diskpart and a VHD, which is mentioned at your link $URL$ You can format it as FAT32, and you can always convert it to NTFS later. (I did that with XP). Windows 7 has a convert command to do that (XP had too apparently) $URL$ 

in these days of virtual machines, anybody that -has- virtual machines (perhaps ypu do?) most do. I don't unfortunately! But anybody with them can do a test. You put files of various extensions in various directories, do a system restore see if the files disappear. I did a test long ago, but don't have the notes I made. I know with windows xp c:\program files and the user profile, and the desktop, are at risk directories, certain new files(maybe only certain extensions) will disappear from there.and files in subdirectories of program files. exe files would disappear. Any directory you create in root like c:\sdfsf is definitely fine/left alone. No doubt youre registry is pushed back in xp it says "the process does not cause you to lose saved documents or work and is completely reversible". maybe they get away with that message because they say it's reversible! I don't recall if it removes "new" TXTs on desktop , it wouldn't surprise me. It does remove "new" EXEs. By new I mean since the restore. EXEs are definitely a file type it likes to remove, from the directories it likes to remove from. It might remove whole directories too, I don't recall, but worth a try, you may find any new directory created in c:\program files is removed. $URL$ "The following is a list of monitored file name extensions. Files with these extensions are monitored by System Restore in Windows Vista and later. The files that are monitored or excluded from monitoring in Windows XP are specified in the file %windir%\system32\restore\Filelist.xml. The file Filelist.xml does not exist in Windows Vista and later." (it's a long list, maybe not a good idea for me to copy/paste it)
