assoc and ftype, provide a mapping between extension and a program to launch for that extension. And for some reason, despite what I have specified by assoc and ftype, some other application is loading, so it seems the OS is reading its data(on what application to launch) , from elsewhere before even checking assoc and ftype I have a file extension .vbsc which is associated with cscript and i'd like it associated with something else, even calc.exe I just want to be able to change the association but I don't seem to be able to. But I can for other extensions. Below is a demonstrartion. In the demonstration, I use assoc and ftype to create an association for a file extension .ab5 and the demonstration shows that works. I then change the association so it brings up another program, the demonstration shows that works. I then try it with my problem extension, and it doesn't work. And it's not because my problem extension is 4 char long, there are many long extensions. There is a second demonstration below this one which I describe where you scroll down to it. So it's reading something else before ftype. 

So you can say and you can say And that non-powershell method only works if you know the format of the date on the system, and know that it's US. I would generally recommend against batch, because for example what if a new revision of the OS comes along and the output of a command is a bit different and your code presumes a particular format in its parsing. And while in this case batch is in one sense, neat, sometimes it can be like banging sticks together. It's a good idea to know batch and to use it a bit but to install some other scripting language like Ruby or Python or Golang or NodeJS. But if you want to use solely batch for this, then there it is. 

Is there a later version of paste for windows that doesn't do that? Or does this problem exist even in the latest linux version of paste.. And is there a way around it? It the meantime i'll encode utf-8 files without the BOM, before using paste. 

I then opened it in gvim as you see from the screenshot. I might join many of the lines (vim's J) to stop it from wrapping before the end of the line. But that aside, a problem is the funny characters The file is UTF-8 

When you open these webpages in Chrome, Or forget the webpages, and when you just copy this: תורה נביאים וכתובים Select text, select more than one word(as you want to make sure the words come in the correct order). And copy, then paste into ms word 2010. You get this appear. i.e. just near the text you paste in, it says "ctrl", then click that and you can choose "keep source formatting" That should ensure the words are in the correct order. Here is a pic from Ms Word 2010, giving the option you want, after you've selected from a webpage e.g. yaya.htm or yaya2.htm, and clicked copy, and you've chosen to paste it into ms word. note that "keep source formatting" option! That can put words into the correct order if they're in the wrong order. 

Forget a Hub as it's like the technology before switches. It has a use for packet sniffing but you don't want it for that. Switches are often called intelligent hubs. They're both equally easy to use (plug in and use) so get the switch. If you already have 2 computers running on your motorola then that device is a NAT Router, but if there is only one socket for attaching a wired device then you should get a switch, which you plug into the one wired socket and it will give you more sockets. 

You can connect Network A to a network switch, and Network B to a network switch. Then connect each switch to a Central Router and configure the Router so one interface is for one IP range, the other for the other IP range. And make sure DHCP isn't set on both routers. I suppose you either have to set the IPs manually to get the 2 different ranges. Or, get the central router to do the DHCP. Those modem/routers most likely wouldn't cope with sending via DHCP one IP range on one port and another IP range on another port. My experience is they can't even cope with 2 different networks with 2 different IP ranges. But a central router (not modem-router) could and if not, then set IPs manually on each computer That said. You could perhaps look at it as one network 192.168.0.0 and configure both ADSL modem/routers that that's the network. Then you don't need a central router at all and can just connect them both together via ethernet cable. But then it's not two separate networks it'd be one network, but that's within the capabilities of your adsl modem-routers. 

How can I play and convert (old) autodesk animator files (FLI files) in Windows 7? An example FLI file. 

I can see how it could be done.. So you have 3 computers. A,B,C A,B are behind NAT. Let's say B is the intermediary Method 1 2 tunnels So you can make an SSH connection from A to B (Tunnel 1). And from C to B(Tunnel 2). And forward Tunnel 1, to tunnel 2. Computer A connects with SSH -L Computer C connects with SSH -R The -L or -R determines which side of the tunnel listens and which side of the tunnel forwards. So, unless I have erred, you could do something like- 

NAT/NAPT port forwarding, on your NAT router so the public address on the public interface of NAT router goes to the private ip of a comp. But make sure the telnet password is very very strong. People tend to use ssh these days not telnet. 

There is an issue above, in that you are using in a for loop and what happens with in a for loop e.g. in batch files, is very strange compared to any other language! The will get replaced by whatever is, and then not again after that. You could try to test this by doing set w=abcdefg then run your batch file and see if w is still that. But on my machine, after it is running set and then you have echo that there in the echo, is then set to the current value of , which is your first bat file. And that's it. It stays that way. It's not what you intend no doubt but that's what happens. Here is your bat file I removed @echo off. 

i've just found that when I double click the regular battery icon.. if I unplug the power cord, a new line appears saying how many hours and minutes remaining "total time remaining" appears, under Total battery power remaining xx% So if win xp does it, no freeware necessary or not that necessary. Added- It looks like a)the ACDC adaptor has to be unplugged from it b)the power has to be below 100% i.e. 99% or less. Then, it shows time remaining. Added- I have chosen to accept my answer as the best. Because, reading my question, anybody answering correctly should spot a flawed assumption that it makes, and should have corrected it. I wrote "I would like to see the hours remaining, and total capacity, not just the percentage shown by Windows XP." A correct answer should have said that most laptops running win XP WILL show the hours remaining. This infact negates the main need for such 3rd party software (other than a)convenience or b)uncooperative laptops). There was a mistaken assumption in my question that should have been spotted and corrected, and its correction held the answer to my question. nhinkle did mention it, but as a useful elaborative comment to my answer after I had already spotted it and in effect, by me spotting it, I answered my question by destroying the false assumption I had made. good comment though! 

The partition is corrupt (in my case not done right) This can be determined, by looking at the claimed size of the partition, the amount used and the amount remaining. The claimed size of the partition is 320GB, the size of the drive. The amount used on the drive or partition, is 13GB. So there should be lots of space left, not just a few hundred megabytes. I managed to resize it in Paragon to about 195GB but it is still corrupt and this can be shown in a similar manner. The claimed size was 195GB. This time, the amount remaining was 195GB. So that wasn't right as I was using 13GB. So definitely partition was not done right, and that is the or a sign of it. 

I can use my web browser, to convert that Windows-1255 into unicode(eg as UTF-8). For example, with that HTML. Chrome converts úåøä ---> תורה úåøä ðáéàéí åëúåáéí --> תורה נביאים וכתובים But how can I convert the other way? For example, suppose I have a file I write in notepad It has 

The EFI folder is a necessity. but don't write the folder manually unless you're experimenting or know what you're doing. It's going to be with the OS ISO. Apparently Win7 has some issues with USB3 though that wasn't the issue here. That'd cause other symptoms. Windows 10 can also be made by the windows 10 "media creation tool" instead of rufus though rufus I have found to be ok. And the reason why Macrium reflect booted, was that the current one is based on WinPE 10 64bit which is the WinPE for Windows 10. Windows 10 64bit, has the EFI folder. (I can't comment on windows 10 32bit) And when the Macrium program makes the USB it must be it gives it a partition format that supports UEFI e.g. GPT or a form of MBR that supports UEFI, and the USB would have the EFI folder. 

It will crash because the motherboard's chipset is different in the other computer. Windows 9X e.g. 98 You could take the hard drive from one computer to another with a different motherboard chipset. So, what you did would have worked with Win98 Windows NT (XP,2K,e.t.c.) cannot. It is built differently. You're using XP of course.. And you can fix it after the "fail", by doing a windows xp repair installation. Boot off the windows XP CD to do so. You will obviously have to install drivers for your computer's components.. But that's fine. Same as one would have had to do with Win98. (the fact of having to install drivers) and possibly removing old drivers. You may get by without installing drivers manually. Note- Some people use a method acronis has to make an image of windows NT(so XP included) from one computer and put it onto another computer with a different motherboard chipset. 

The OS always has the DNS server written in but it can be the router IP, and the router then goes to your ISP's. Or the OS can point directly to a DNS server (your ISPs or somebody elses like Google offers a DNS server). It should be faster to give your OS your ISPs or Google's DNS server, rather than your computer making a DNS request to your router and for your router to then contact a DNS server. I can see my DNS servers in my router but if you can't then you can call your ISP and ask them. Or use Google's. or 

What Unicode encoding is used is not OS based. Even Windows notepad.exe has options listed- (i'll put in brackets what notepad means by that) ANSI(not unicode), Unicode(notepad means Unicode LE), Unicode Big Endian(BE), UTF-8 ANSI isn't unicode it involves a very limited number of characters so lets put that aside. But see even notepad can do LE, or BE, or UTF-8 And notepad aside, UTF-8 can be with or without a BOM. And I use Windows with Cygwin though Windows ports may well do \r\n even when you specify \n Have seen sed do that. There is no one rule of what Unicode encoding a particular OS uses. It wouldn't be a very flexible OS if there was. To really see the differences know the Software, what Encoding a piece of software uses or offers. Get Cygwin and xxd, and/or a hex editor and look at what is really inside the file. Use the 'file' command to help identify a file. Then you actually see what UTF 16bit LE is. What UTF 16bit BE is. What UTF-8 is (and UTF-8 can be with or without a BOM). Sometimes you can tell notepad to save as unicode(by which notepad means unicode 16 bit little endian), and it won't. But choose a unicode font like arial unicode, and copy in some unicode characters from charmap and it will.. And a good way to see what notepad or whatever software is doing, is by looking at the hex of a file 

No Way. The most would be Windows uses \r\n and unix \n, And even then, you can write a file with *nix line endings in Windows and vice versa. but if no new line characters.. no way. You can't see the origin of the file, there's no tag of any kind 

I can open one task manager. Ctrl-Shift-Escape I want to open another, so I can show one tab in one and another tab in another. But when I do ctrl-shift-escape again, it just pulls up the one I already opened. I'm sure in the past there have been times when i've done it. How does one do it? 

PATH has nothing to do with finding .java files. PATH is just to do with executable files.. (and possibly others if adding certain extensions to PATHEXT, but that use case isn't so relevant to your problem, and anyhow PATH wouldn't have anything to do with specifying a file as a parameter to a program, which is what you were expecting) You have to either go to the path where the file is and do javac helloworld.java 

They don't ping each other directly, it went through the router. They can only ping each other directly if they are connected directly. Here's an example from my network They went through the so-called "home/Nat router", the switch within the device, though the output isn't showing you that 

I think so Many routers don't do that and so for example, in that situation you have to use the internal ip, when you are inside your LAN, or it won't work at all. open a cmd window and do 

If you want a News Client, a bit like how outlook express does email, a program that accesses usenet i'm sure Mac/OSX users have some suggestions. 

then play the output file, h.mpg in WMP, hopefully will work! That's converting it to an MPEG container format, with audio codec of MP2, and video codec of MPEG1. That combination should be supported by WMP. No reason to mix up those 3 things. And you can download mediainfo to find out that kind of info from any video file. The CLI version of mediainfo is very clear $URL$
