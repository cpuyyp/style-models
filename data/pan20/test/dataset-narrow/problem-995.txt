I would like to create a virtual Windows 7 or 8 in my Windows 8.1 64 machine. Years ago I used Virtual PC to similar stuff and I know things have advanced a lot and I haven't kept up. What are my choices now? Do I need VMWare? Windows can do this now? VirtualBox? 

I have several small images I would like to display all opened at the same time (on my second monitor)? I would like to multiselect the files in file explorer or from within the tool and get them displayed next to each other. Any ideas? I am using Windows 7. 

My Firefox sends MAC addresses of nearby access points when a geolocation javascript function is called. Is there a Windows tool which can display the same information? 

My SSD which was manufactored this year has a sector size of 512 bytes. Can it be changed to 2k or 4k while keeping the data. Using Windows 7. I want to benchmark and see if bigger sector size increased read/write speed. 

There are tens, if not hundreds, of file types checkboxes under indexing options in Windows 7. It's a chore to unselect each checkbox. Is there a way to unselect all of them in one shot? 

Why worry about your ISP? That's just a business trying to make some money, they probably won't bother. It might be much easier to reveal what you've been up to by examining your own computer. Like: which Flash-enabled websites has your computer visited since you bought it? However, as for your current government administration things may be different. Just a few examples: 

(And I think you can safely delete the file and re-attach your Time Machine drive after that. But, moving the file to another location might be a safer option.) 

If a Mac's Aqua was X, then you would not need to run X (XQuartz) to start other X programs on a Mac... So: no, I think you cannot do this. 

However, this may in fact be quite old, so is your virus scanner indeed running...? EDIT: yesterday, searching for 186.81.185.135 only gave 1 result, today 2 (plus this Super User question itself)... Maybe be quite recent after all? 

should remove all funny characters below 31. See also Microsoft's Remove spaces and nonprinting characters from text and Top ten ways to clean your data. 

Apple's implementation will probably also just make the router quickly send the magic packet when it finds that some computer is trying to connect to iTunes, a printer, SSH, files or your screen, or is trying to use Back to My Mac. 

I am looking for a GUI (not command line) tool to combine text file from different sub folders into a single text file. I used to have such a tool and I can't find it on my computer. I specify the file extension and the top folder and the tool would combine all the files from all the sub folders. It also writes the full path of the filename before the contents of the file (a requirement). Any similar tools? (don't mention a tool unless it meets all the requirements I mentioned) 

Looking for a tool to report what codecs were used for audio and video encoding for all files in a folder. I use GSpot but it does it on a file per file basis. I want a tool to do it for all files in a folder. For windows. 

I have two opened Windows applications in Windows 7 which I would like to switch between them using a single keyboard shortcut, either one key to switch between them or a separate key for each. Basically instead of clicking the app icon on the taskbar, to do it through a keyboard hotkey. How can this be done? I don't want to use alt-tab to switch because I have several other opened apps. 

To do this automatically for any downloaded file you can attach a folder action to the download folder, like described on macosxhints.com in 10.5: Remove the 'downloaded file' warning flag. And the following was posted on macosxhints.com a long time ago, for Safari: 10.5: Disable the 'downloaded from internet' file warning, claiming one can remove from . I did not test that. As an aside: sometimes one needs to start a single program multiple times on a Mac. That can be done using followed by . This really needs the suffix; running might get one GateKeeper stopping access: 

Did you enable FileVault recently? Then your home folder is only being backed up when you log out. Is your home folder somehow excluded in your Time Machine settings? Or is it included in the output of the following? (Which it should not) 

Next, type the following, changing into whatever Gmail address you want the test message to be delivered to. (The angle brackets are required.) You can also use multiple lines, as long as these are known to Gmail: 

You might need to click on the message list to actually see Mail changed it. Again: the above does not solve your problem yet! Also, when one figures out how to persist the changed subject, then the search and removal/replace needs to be much more sophisticated than just searching for a single "Aw: ". For a true Mail Rule, things need to be slightly different. Copy the relevant parts from a working standalone script into the following, save it and then create a new Rule in Mail for each incoming message (or for messages for a specific sender): 

I used to use a Firefox extension which opened mailto links in one of the popular web based emails systems like Hotmail. I can't locate it. 

I am using Windows 7 64 bit with 8G ram. After some use, I feel Windows is getting sluggish. The drive is thrashing. When I look at the resource monitor and disk activity, I see a few instances of use of the page file (c:\pagefile.sys). I check the physical memory and I see about 2.3G available memory and 700M free memroy. Why doesn't Windows use more of the free memory and less of the page file? Does it need to leave some x amount of free ram, how much would that be? Is it a percentage of physical ram? My plan is get more ram and an SSD for the main drive. Meanwhile I am suffering from slow performance. 

I am looking for a good tool which finds all the programs which are hooking to the keyboard handler. Hotkey Commander is not showing all the programs. I have two apps running and they have a global hotkey defined and working but these program are not listed in Hotkey Commander. Deep System Explorer is not finding some driver and displays an error. Any others? I am using windows 7 64bit. 

Sounds like your computer's clock or time zone is not set correctly. By the way: it seems the error code is clickable, so probably gives you more details? 

This will work in all modern browsers; you can have a look with yours. In Font Awesome, the code point is not U+F8FF but U+F179, and is U+F17A (both also in the private use area, like explained in other answers). 

(which, when clicking from the Event Viewer, might include the event ID if applicable). So, not very likely, but: maybe Microsoft surprises you if you click it. :-) (See also How To Solve Any Windows Problem with Event ID.) 

I think in the old Windows XP days it was sufficient to just quote the filename? Those quotes would then be removed by Windows. So, rename to save the file as: 

We debugged quite randomly, and could not find a way to tell what triggered this dialog. But the following Apple Support Communities post explained how to find it by trial and error: 

Assuming this is a Windows XP SP2 or later client: If the server uses NAT, then see Microsoft's KB 885407, "The default behavior of IPsec NAT traversal (NAT-T) is changed in Windows XP Service Pack 2". According to Wikipedia: 

My Quick Launch disappeared after a restart in Windows 8. I restarted my computer many times before and Quick Launch didn't disappear but it happened this last time. There's a hot fix for this issue in Windows 7 but I am running Windows 8. I can see the Quick Launch folder under C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch. How do I manually fix this issue? I am guessing a shortcut to the Quick Launch folder needs to be added somewhere? 

My Windows 8 username/password is attached to my Hotmail.com account. I am not how this happened. I think the installation asked me for it however I don't like this arrangement. I need to use a separate account which is not attached to anything external. How do I remove this account from Windows? Is it checking my Hotmail password every time I log into the computer? This account is an admin account. 

I have a bunch of shell extensions which show up from the right mouse click. I would like to delete the ones I never use. Is there a tool which can do this? I know they can be removed from the registry but I couldn't find some of them in the registry and I prefer to use a tool which can safely remove them. (using Windows 8) 

† So yes, Facebook knows which web sites you're visiting, for all sites that include some Facebook widget, even if that's only the "Like" button. Stop using Facebook if that bothers you, or at least install something like Privacy Badger. 

(I redacted the URL, so this will now give you a redirect warning you'd not get with a proper URL.) This probably holds all kind of tracking info (and also the Google cookies are sent along with this POST), which might be blocked by a privacy-related plugin or virus scanner. So, disable those to find the cause. (Also, Google keeps changing the way they show the search results. You might even get the long link when copying it. Not today, for me, on the English google.com.) 

It seems has used some local storage which my Safari does not show me, and hence cannot be deleted. So, in general: how to ensure all local storage is deleted from Safari? Some background and details: The HTML5 Local Storage allows websites to store information on a computer. (That's a bit like cookies, but the contents are not sent to the server automatically.) Like when one has once logged in to the (new) Twitter website, then when viewing that site and pasting the following into the location bar shows a lot of details, even when not currently logged in†: 

How to jump to a folder in File Explorer's Quick Access using a keyboard shortcut? I forgot what it was and Google couldn't help. 

I was trying to delete a subfolder in a folder and noticed I lost all the files and subfolders in the folder in a split second. This is really unusual because it happened too fast. It would have taken at least 30 seconds (due to the number of files and folders) if I wanted a normal delete. I think I saw a flicker too. The files were not in the recycle bin. I rebooted and the files were not there. Then I ran a portable file recovery app from a USB drive and it found NO deleted files in the whole drive! I mean not in any other folders either. Another weird thing. I am guessing some corruption happened maybe in the file system or MFT but Windows and apps seem to be running fine. But the odd thing there are no traces of deleted files anywhere. (I don't have a backup but then the deleted files were mostly downloads over 2 years and can be replaced) Any ideas of what could have happened? 

I have a Windows 7 system that gets locked. It didn't used to until I changed some settings like enabling the screen saver and resume with password. AFAIK, I have reversed the settings. For example, it never sleeps. The computer still gets locked automatically. What are the computer settings which cause the computer to lock? 

Above, even removing the extended attribute does not fix that, but using the suffix works just fine. (I am not advising anyone to actually get rid of the security measures.) 

This does not explain why it won't work with the hub, but on the MacBook itself, all USB ports aren't created equal. 

(Non-default headers that are not used in any Rule will disappear after some time.) For the archives: note that Gmail is known for silently not delivering emails that are sent from a Gmail account and have the same account as the final recipient. So, when sing Gmail to send a message to an address that is (copy-) forwarded to your own Gmail account, then you will not see that copy in Gmail. To ensure forwarding is indeed used: send a message from a non-Gmail account. 

...and compare it to the metadata of a file that opens as expected. Maybe , or show something odd? (Some shameless plug for Apple Mail, and surely not an answer to your question, so just in case you cannot fix it and are considering if you should kiss Thunderbird goodbye: Apple Mail works fine with the Energy Saver –Thunderbird always kept my Macs from sleeping, but haven't used it for 3 years– and is Time-Machine-aware. When entering Time Machine while Mail is active, you'll get the galaxy thingy for Mail rather than for Finder. You can then even find messages for accounts that don't exist anymore, and to restore them you don't need to know how Mail stores the messages on your hard disk.)
