I used to have lots of strange issues with SIP400 cards and 7609 chassis... Not sure if this one is matching the behaviour but please check it: CSCsb69734 SIP400: Sub-int IP state up but not reachable after SSO & reload Symptom: In rare situations, the 7600-SIP-400 SPA-2X1GE sub-interfaces can be unreachable even when the interface state is up. Ping or even control plane traffic (such as OSPF hellos) do not pass through the sub-interface but traffic passes through the main interface. Conditions: The problem might be encountered when a SSO switchover is done concurrently on one of the routers and line card/SPA reset is done on the directly connected interface on the other router. Workaround: When the interface is manually reset the problem disappears (i.e. shutdown, then no shutdown on the interface). A SPA/line card reset also solves the problem. Further Problem Description: This problem is seen with IP & IPv6 configurations on the subinterface. 

Most probably you have an application issue on the server listening to the traffic and it is not sending IGMP messages correctly. You can solve the problem by adding ip igmp static group to the outgoing interface. 

Please do the following: -shutdown the switch -press Mode button while power on the switch to enter in switch: mode. -set BAUD 115200 -flash_init -copy the file The random symbols are normal since you are transferring the file via console. So you can actually see the data flowing via the link. Just leave it for few hours and image will be uploaded. 

Imagine a situation when packet arrives at the first router and it's size is nearly to the MTU of the physical egress port of the router, then it is encapsulated with IPSEC headers. Those additional headers will probably exceed the MTU of the egress port In such situation the packet is going to be fragmented after encryption - post-fragmentation. Of course this forces the remote IPsec peer to perform reassembly before decryption. You can avoid post-fragmentation if you set the MTU in the upstream data path to ensure that fragmentation occurs before encryption (prefragmentation). Prefragmentation is really important from performance perspective because it is moving the reassembly task from the remote IPSEC peer to the end host. 

Do you receive some error message when trying? Are you sure that you are using the correct username ? (Note: "patrick" is listed in the config snipped, "Patrick" can be seen in the running config) 

RSTP protocol which is now widely implemented is sending BPDUs only on designated ports. Those 9 are sent during convergence activity in the past. 

If you really want to explore the topic for measuring optimizing TCP perfromance I'd recommend to read RFC-6349 

The thing is that you have an MPLS network in the middle of your traceroute. Actually results from traceroute are not really accurate when it comes to MPLS environment. What happens is that all ICMP TTL exceeded messages originated by a P device first have to be tunneled to the other edge using the original label stack before being sent back to the originator of traceroute operation. Therefore, you will always see end-to-end RTT across the provider core in the output. You need to trace from PE router toward a provider-scoped IP address to resolve this "layering" problem and observe proper RTT. NOTE: DNS resolving is correctly configured. 

I'm auditing switch interface descriptions at work. I work nights and sometimes people during the day shut down their computers when they leave, so I don't see which computers are on interfaces when I'm not there. I have a mix of Cisco 3500 and 3600 series switches where it's possible to use curl (then some grep statements) 

to get the running config, MAC address table, interface descriptions, etc. I'm using this to generate reports of MAC address tables and int descriptions when I'm not at work so I can audit switch interfaces to see what phones and PCs are online when I'm not in. I have MAC addresses documented from machines when they are unboxed, so I can compare the MACs I have with the ones reported in the automated curl statements. This will also be used to see if anyone's violating the "Don't BYOD" policy. This has worked flawlessly with the 3500s, 3550s, 3560s, and 3650s I have. I also have some sg300s that don't appear to be able to do that. Is that an accurate assumption? 

We had a broadcast storm that went undiagnosed for several hours. After the problem switch was unplugged and traffic returned to normal, we had a handful of machines and switches that were broken. On one switch, the sole uplink interface had to be moved to another int. On another, one of the two etherchannel physical members is down. One machine has a SSD and it didn't boot up after it was shut down. BIOS says it's a 32 KB disk. At least one other server's fans would ramp up to high RPMs every couple of minutes. I read that storm traffic not intended for a machine is dropped by the NIC, but broadcast traffic is sent up the network stack and can cause high CPU utilization. I imagine if the OS was writing log files because of the increased network activity it could eventually fill up disk space and/or burn up an SSD because of the increased read/writes. 

Why when we had 20 Mbps service did we not have this problem where any one user could monopolize all the bandwidth to the internet? Am I correct in thinking that Quality of Service configurations would prevent this or does QoS simply identify which traffic has priority over another, and does nothing for competing traffic of the same type? If it's the latter, and my vocabulary is wrong, what statements do I need to configure and where (we have a Cisco 4507 core switch, a Cisco Pix on the primary ISP, a Cisco ASA on the backup ISP, and the inaccessible ISP router is a Cisco 2911) so that no one user can take all the available bandwidth to our internet connection? 

We upgraded from 20 Mbps to 50 Mbps DIA about two months ago. This required a router upgrade as well. Since then, anyone who starts a large HTTP download - e.g. an ISO, large spreadsheet or log, movie file, etc. - can take all of the available bandwidth and block others from accessing the internet. The old router didn't have any kind of QoS configured on it. Further, it was a very vanilla config. It simply had some named ints, the security levels of each, and the IP addresses associated with each int. The ISP supplied the new router and we don't have access to view the config, but they said they don't have any kind of QoS configured on it either. My questions are: 

3) If you issue the boot command and the result is in a successful bootup, either the default switch> prompt or the hostname> prompt displays 4) If you issue the boot command and the command does not result in a successful bootup, either the switch: prompt displays or you are stuck in a continuous reboot again. The only option to recover the switch is an Xmodem file transfer 

I have personally done that ARP timeout set to 60 sec for a single VLAN caused 0.05% ARP usage on cisco 29XX series. It is running like that for over a month. No problems at all. Still I'd not recommend using the network for solving clustering problems. 

The practical rule for latency calculation is ~0.3 ms for every 100km. In other words for the distance between Singapore and Canada (13 000 km straight line) the latency should be around 390ms. I assume it is little bit lower. You can measure it by using ping. The output will give you the RTT. Once you have that value you can use following calculator: TCP CALCULATOR So if we consider that you really have 100Mbit/s international traffic available and default TCP window size of 64kbyte you will get following as speed: 

More specific match is always going to be selected, so all the traffic will go to 234. You can't control how other ASNs are going to do their routing. If they decide to announce more specific static via redistribution then all the traffic will use it. However in normal situation ISP is not going to use static routes for subnet which is not part of their address space. 

You can attach cisco switch with two PCs behind the router. Dot1q trunking can be used with 1 vlan per PC for traffic generation and second one for SLA probes. The router must be used for inter-vlan routing, traffic shaping also should be configured here. IPERF/JPERF can be used for traffic generation. On both switch ports you can mark the traffic with specific DSCP value, which needs to be used later in the policy. Speed can be easily measured with IPERF: 

Very strange topology... However in my opinion you have to add route on "Router to configure" for 192.168.10.X network pointing to PC1 ( 192.168.0.9). 

You can add ip flow ingress/ip flow egress under the interface (Ethernet0 in your case). This will enable NETFLOW caching of the traffic passing through that link. No worries no risk involved. After that you can execute show ip cache-flow and you will see all the packets passing through that interface. Most probably the rest of the devices have more specific routing and default gateway is not used at all. 

1) Issue the flash_init command and the load_helper command switch: flash_init switch: load_helper 2) Issue the dir flash: command in order to view the contents of the Flash file system. After you have verified where the Cisco IOS image file resides, try to boot the image. Issue either the 

In addition to that you will need mls qos trust on the trunk facing the SW, which is doing the classification and mls qos enable on the SW itself 

My first question has to do with the links between Core and aggregation. I could use MC-LAG (Dell VLT), Stacking or just OSPF everywhere. 

Ok, lets try again. It seems Im having problem asking the right questions so lets take it from the beginning. I work at a HPC center at a university. We have a number of small (<300 nodes) clusters and a few storage systems. To our site we get a statically routed /22 network. Today we have the whole /22 in a single broadcast domain and we have decided to redesign and renumber the network for better scalability and performance. To do this we have bought two new L3 switches (Dell s6000-on) to use as our backbone. Connected to these we will have the aggregation switches of the individual clusters (which are HP 5400) and it will look something like this: 

Now we want to renumber the hosts with private IP-adresses (one net per cluster) and use OSPF internally, to reach the internet we still use a default route to some central university router. One important thing is that we still need to have some hosts with public IPs reachable from the internet (a few login nodes per cluster and some other services). 

First of all 802.11g is 2.4Ghz only and 802.11a is 5GHz only. If you don't have a dual band client (a+g) it can only connect to g OR a depending on what band your client supports. 802.11n can do both 2.4GHz (gn) and 5GHz (an) depending on your AP. A 2.4GHz 802.11n (gn) device can always behave as a 802.11g device because the n only means bigger channel width (40MHz) and up to four spatial streams. But it can revert back to using just one spatial stream if there is a 802.11g client. The same is true for a 5GHz 802.11n (an) device, it can also revert back to fewer streams if needed. Please have a look at: $URL$ 

In classful networks the class is determined by the leading four bits in the ip-address. B-networks start with 10 (binary). So, in fact 190.28.0.0 is a Class B network. $URL$ When it comes to CIDR you can say nothing about the size of a network from just 190.28.0.0. But 190.28.0.0/16 tells me there is 16 bits in the network part of the address and the remaining 16 are host bits. Since ip-address calculations are performed in binary, to find a netmask that will divide a /16 into 8 subnets you do the calculation 2^x = 8 (looking for how many digits you need in a binary number to have 8 combinations) which is 3. So, a /16 can be divided into 8 /19. 

On every vlan I have two ip ranges (for historical reasons). To PXE boot machines on these vlans I use ip helper/dhcp relay to relay requests onto the vlan where the dhcp server sits. But the dhcp server only handles DHCP requests for one of the ip ranges (the one used as source address in the relayed dhcp message). How could I tell my dhcp server så accept dhcp requests for multiple subnets from one specific IP?
