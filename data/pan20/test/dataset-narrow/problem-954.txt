to 100% guarantee nothing can be retrieved, I'd wipe the drive first. The industry standard for IT policies is to use DBAN boot 'n nuke ($URL$ which would wipe everything form the HDD - THEN you can reinstall the OS. Edit: Make sure you have a disk, or flash drive of your Operating system to reinstall it afterwards. If you don't have the sticker with your product code, there's a guide here: $URL$ for getting it before you nuke the HDD. 

Okay, so I have 2 120GB Sandisk SSDs. I plugged one into the system, fired it up and all was fine to install windows (installed 7). The owner then asked to have a 2nd SSD added to do a raid 0. Contrary to online help forums, the machine (Lenovo 50-50 (90B6) did NOT have a RAID utility in the Bios, under SATA mode it was either Disabled, IDE, or AHCI - no RAID option. We also had the issue that the machine was one SATA port shy for a proposed HDD backup drive (not yet installed). SO, I purchased this Raid card from Amazon ($URL$ to A. fix the shortage of ports and B. provide SATA support. It was a complete faff to get it working as the instructions provided no help or drivers but I got there in the end and got the cards raid BIOS going, set up the two SSDs in RAID 0 and fired up a windows 7 boot drive. It showed me a now 223.4GB partition named 'Disk 0 Partition 1. but says "Windows cannot be installed to disk 0 Partition 1. (show details). showing details tells me "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. This computer's hardware may not support booting to this disk. Ensure that the disk's controller is enabled in the computer's BIOS menu. SO. back to the BIOS to check it's booting my new RAID 0 drive before windows and I now see that the BIOS isn't showing the new drive in the boot sequence, nor is it available to add to said sequence. Pulling my hair out here! any suggestions? I've also tested each of the two SSDs in a separate machine and no issues whatsoever. 

Usually, the derived work is just the piece (image) itself. If you're using other content from the page as well, then it would apply to the entire page. If your site is based around the image, you might have more trouble than if the image is just there to complement your existing content. Of course, it would be best to consult a lawyer. 

You'll probably have the best luck writing a script to do it yourself in the browser - I don't believe there's an option you can set within the system to specify this. 

Honestly, I'd use GIMP with layers, and just export to .jpg if I needed a flat image. This would give you the history as well as more control editing, and isn't that much more work to maintain. 

What you're looking for is the Avant Window Navigator (awn) - the link has instructions for gutsy, but they should apply equally to new distributions as well! 

I just keep a headphone jack adapter plugged in when I'm in public places, so the volume is effectively muted and there's no disturbance. 

Probably the easiest option would be to have it publish a snapshot every x minutes or hours to a website, which you could then control with some sort of password-based authentication. Accessing the camera directly will be much more difficult and probably not worth the hassle if all you need to do is check your mail. 

Yes - you can use Partition Magic or the like to do this. Defragmenting your drive first should give you a bit more space at the end of the drive to work with. 

I've used SUPER and had good results, but some people are leery that it might be a bit suspicious (so, be careful and make you're you're only downloading from the developer's site). It's basically a front-end to the ffmpeg library, which can do anything and everything video-related. 

Like Stefan mentioned, this is most likely a problem with each individual messaging application. Try installing a multi-protocol client like Pidgin and see if you have success with that - otherwise, take a look at the password storing options on each other app. 

I have an ethernet wall socket in one room which is wired to another ethernet wall socket in another room. Everything appears to be connected up correctly, but it does not appear to be functioning. Here are photos of the wiring. Room 1 Wiring 

Macro Express Pro will be able to do this for you. It has a very nice graphical language that allows you to drag sequences of commands onto a list. I've been using it for about 5 years, it powerful enough to do just about anything you can imagine, including this task. Suggest setting the "activation" to "clipboard", add a command to copy the contents of the clipboard to a variable, then switch focus to your target program, paste it in, then switch focus back. I've just finished writing a big a big macro to do the same thing as you're describing, to copy text from a web page into a document for safe keeping whenever I hit a hotkey. 

I ended up using PostgreSQL. I also managed to get MySQL working (after a huge amount of problems with it - the MySQL developers obviously never tested it much on Windows as it barely works). 

Try logging in with a user account that has Administrator privileges. You can check your privileges in the "Control Panel" and "User Accounts" section. 

How do compress an entire drive, ignoring previously compressed files (in particular, .zip, .rar and .tib)? Compressing a ".tib" file is pointless: its an Acronis TrueImage file, about 15GB, and as its already compressed it makes no savings to disk space, while wasting about 2 hours of time. 

If you want cloud backup, then I prefer Amazon S3 plus some backup program such as 2BrightSparks SyncBackPro or CloudBerry. They will both handle synchronization issues seamlessly (SyncBackPro has more powerful features, however its not as easy to use out of the box). 

I'd like to tune my network card to have the absolute minimum latency when pinging a remote server. Is there a Windows utility that allows me to change things such as MTU, ACK time, buffer length, etc? 

I have a Hex-core Xeon X5650 running Windows 7 x64. I'm currently doing simultaneous compression of three NTFS hard drives, 2TB each, with the commands: 

Take a look at the Google documentation here for tips on setting up folders to handle deletion properly. The default behaviour for Outlook does what you want, though the iPhone will require different actions to do what you want (which are also outlined in the link). 

No advertising and a ten-fold improvement in application startup time are my reasons. The plugins and themes with Pidgin are attractive, as well. 

Screen brightness is the #1 thing I change. After that, any network service that's constantly polling for a connection is big - Bluetooth is a huge power hog (at least on my cell and notebook). 

Following these recommendations is a good start, though it really depends on your setup and what you want to do with the system every day. Disabling things like network discovery and any sort of software your printer might've come with is a good start as well, though if those are applications you use frequently, YMMV. 

If you can copy all of the data into one sheet, you can use the 'remove duplicates' (under Data) to find unique addresses. If you colour-code the entries from each file first, you'll be able to tell which came from where, and which ones are left over. Edit: If you used background colours to code the entries, you can use this function to count the entries. If you coloured the font, you can use this function, taking care to replace 'Interior' with 'Font' as noted in the explanation at the top. 

I usually go for the queue-up-then-minimize approach, but out of the box I don't believe there's any other way to do it. 

PDF Split and Merge is a tool I've had great success with, and it comes in GUI and command-line flavours. If the command-line version is anything like the GUI, you should have no problem scripting a solution. 

See the question - if I want to build the latest version of an app from the source, am I doomed to checking for updates manually? Is there a better way to do this? 

Try the steps in this link, but choose Thunderbird as the program instead of GMail. If that doesn't work, can you click on regular mailto: links? I believe the issue is with the handling of mailto: - Windows doesn't know that there's a program able to handle it.
