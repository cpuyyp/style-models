Disable print spooler Restart machine Delete contents of: C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86 Enable print spooler and start service. Delete the network printer object and re-add network printer off of server. 

Placement of services is more of a thought exercise to come to your own conclusion. My guess based off of the number of printers and the number of servers, is that printing is a low priority service that only a few people manage. If that is the case, it really doesn't matter where you put it. Hope this helps 

So far, no luck on the fonts. I have to have a "silent installer" for these fonts so I can push it out to the 100+ machines this needs to go on. Thanks in advance 

I am running into an interesting issue with some applications not evaluating properly in SCCM 2012. The example software I have is Adobe reader 11. When I install using an MSI deployment through software center, everything works great. The problem comes up when someone goes to the adobe website and downloads the executable installer and runs that. Now software center detects the software as uninstalled and will list is as an available title. I am using the "Windows installer" detection method and looking for this GUID "{AC76BA86-7AD7-1033-7B44-AB0000000001}". When I look in the AppDiscovery.log, all I get is an "+++ Application not discovered." message. So here's the question: Where can I see what the detection method is querying and what it gets back? Bonus Question: When performing a "Windows Installer" detection, where does the system look for that GUID? Thanks in advance 

At our organization, we have multiple levels of support personnel. The lowest (level 1) of these personnel deal with a single job site with about 40 printers. Each site has a Windows Server 2003 R2 machine that provides file and print permissions. These lower level support personnel do not have admin rights to this server and they never will. This is a problem because when a new printer is delivered, the company wide techs (level 2) must add the printer to the server. So my question is this: Is there a way to allow non-admins to add printers to a Windows Server machine? These users shouldn't be able to add drivers or make system wide changes. They just need to be able to add, delete, and configure printer objects and printer ports. The per printer item security permission "manage printer" don't allow the user to modify the port. Anyone have any ideas on what we can do? We need to at least let the user rename the port if possible. Thanks in advance [EDIT] These servers are not Domain controllers, but actually member servers. It apparently makes a difference. 

The correct question would be: why exactly does your service needs to be run as system ? Basically, unless you either build some kind of RPC proxy or change the program to be able to impersonate a domain user, you simply can't grant access to domain resources to the system account. So, please try the following: download and run process monitor (procmon), set it up to register the activity of all processes involved and run them as local user. After this, check the log for any access denied (error code 5) result and come back with a result. At that point, we can start thinking about how to fix it through ACL changes or work around it. 

First, are you sure you really need an interactive session ? Chances are you can actually run it inside a scheduled task if set it up property. Now, assuming the above is not possible/practical/allowed: You can setup your VM to automatically log in a user. The process is described here but here are the high points: 

I'm writing a tool to generate self-signed X509 certificates and X509 certificate requests and I'm wondering how the "critical" property of the SubjectAlternativeName (OID 2.5.29.17) should be handeled. The documentation isn't too clear for me. Should I: 

It will run fine. I'm running a number of VMs (in VMWare), both with 32 and 64 bits versions of Windows and Delphi 7 is running just fine. 

Apache uses OpenSSL to manage SSL/TLS security as well as for managing certificates and OpenSSL does not use the windows certificate store so there are no easy way to implement what you request. So, in your case, the simpler solution would be to offload SSL encryption to a reverse proxy that uses the Windows store (you can use IIS and ARR for that. It's not trivial but it isn't too complex either). However, I'm not sure that would be the proper solution to adopt from an architecture and security point of view. It makes a lot of sense for your administrator to wish to restrict access to the private key linked to your domain wildcard certificate. It makes a lot less sense, however, to do so by installing it the way he does: unless he gave you no admin rights on that server, you will still be able to recover that certificate data from the machine if you put your mind to it. So, the best solution, from my point of view, would be for him to setup a separate system dedicated to performing SSL termination (i.e. a SSL-enabled reverse HTTP proxy) on a system he control. You can then either setup your Apache server as a simple HTTP server and the proxy will take care of the encryption. If your requirements or policies do not allow for cleartext network traffic between your proxy and your web server, than you can setup a self-signed SSL certificate for your apache system and have your reverse trust it (actually any x509 certificate will do: if you have an internal CA, it can be used as well). This way, you're keeping the responsibilities of everyone properly segregated. 

[Background] We have been having trouble with our network clients suddenly being unable to print. They get an odd error with a hex code. We determined that something in the driver was messed up and we could resolve the issue by clearing the driver cache and reinstalling the driver. This happens to random computers every so often. We're assuming this is a bug with the latest Dell 2330dn driver since that is the only model that has this problem. [Problem] What we are looking to do is write a Powershell script that would clear the driver cache and redownload the driver. I see a ton of scripts out there to manage queues, servers, and ports, but nothing for local driver cache management. [Current Workaround] Since we have to do this manually, I'll write out the steps so you know what we want this script to replicate. 

Who is going to be managing this service? Who is going to install new objects to this service? (ie: New printers or drivers) How difficult is it to restart the harware/VM in the event of a major problem? Does the system have enough resources to manage the load? What other services does this hardware provide? Any mission critical? How critical is print services? 

Our company just migrated to Windows 7 and decided to use the included "balanced" power plan. The main problem with this is that I use powershell to do remote management and sleeping machines don't respond to these commands. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can send out a signal to wake up only sleeping machines? Now, I already know that I can use the "Magic Packet" with wake on LAN, but that has a few problems. 

We've begun our migration to windows 7 and we ran into an interesting issue. When we hit "CTRL+ALT+DEL" we are brought to the "User selection Screen". Normally, this screen will have an icon for every local user for the machine. These machines are Domain members with "Fast User Switch" disabled so no user names are listed only the "Other User" option. If you click "Other User" or hit enter, the system moves on to the normal login screen where it prompts for user name and password. Here's the issue: We want to find a way to skip over the part where a user selects "Other User". We essentially want the system to always assume that we always want "Other User" and to go directly to the login screen when a user hits "CTRL+ALT+DEL". What I find odd is that the "Other User" doesn't show up until we've had more than one domain user log in. Right after we re-image the machine, the login process goes directly to the user credential prompt. [EDIT] Security Policies set by Active Directory: 

I have a rather unexpected situation here. I have a small application that connects to a WebDAV server (Sharepoint) using the standard WebDAV windows client (WebClient service, part of the "desktop experience" feature), walk through a number of folder and download all PDF files it finds. The overall process works. However, I'm experiencing a strange issue: when I run the application directly from the server's console or RDP desktop, it runs in about 10 seconds (assuming there is no file to download). When I run the same task from the same user but from a scheduled task, then it takes 5 minutes to complete and yield exactly the same result (files are downloaded if present). I've added debug to the application to see where the latency happens and the result of this is that the operation of listing the file directory seems to take forever, even if the file filter used causes no file to be returned. The same behavior can be observed when using ProcMon: the latency is within the Win32 calls and ourtside of the application alltogether. Now, this isn't really critical since the process works, but the more directories the are added the slower it gets and there will be a point where I will have to decrease the frequency at which the script is run so it can actually complete (or change the application so it start to process the directory in parallel). Would anyone have some kind of explanation why the WebDAV client seems to be several orders of magnitude slower when running from a scheduled task ? In case it matters, the connection is made with an explicit password each time and it goes over SSL. 

Have you considered the possibility of someone simply hitting the power button ? That will cause exactly the behavior you described. 

(or sometimes straight ) Which tells the mail client that there is multiple parts in the message. At this stage, each part must indicate what type it is supposed to be in (in addition to several other parameters). All that to say that, if you mail application sends the message as plain text and you want to convert that as HTML, you will have to, at the very least, change the message's content-type header in addition to change the message body itself.
