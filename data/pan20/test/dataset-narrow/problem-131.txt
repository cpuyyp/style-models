In most cases for charging it does not matter if you are using 2G, 3G or 4G network. Charging is usually defined per service and it is not related to the radio access technology (2G, 3G or 4G). And it is not dependent on the transmission technology between the basestation and the core network - it can be SDH/PDH, Ethernet (over copper or fiber), Frame Relay, point to point radio link, or any combination of these and other technologies. Voice services are charged per call minutes or seconds depending on operator policies. And data services are charged per data volume (usually kilobytes). In 4G, voice can be carried by packets if the technology used is VoLTE (Voice over LTE), even in this case the charging system counts the duration of the call not the transmitted kilobytes. Generally most operators use 2G mainly for voice, 3G for voice and data and 4G for data. Some operators also have deployed VoLTE and use 4G for voice too. 

In a mobile network the UE establishes a PDP Context in order to transmit an receive data. In which cases the PDP contexts is terminated. For example - is it terminated when: 

The whole process is more complex and it is difficult to be described in a short answer. 2G is using TDMA and 3G is using CDMA methond for accessing the radio resource. 

3) If you issue the boot command and the result is in a successful bootup, either the default switch> prompt or the hostname> prompt displays 4) If you issue the boot command and the command does not result in a successful bootup, either the switch: prompt displays or you are stuck in a continuous reboot again. The only option to recover the switch is an Xmodem file transfer 

RSTP protocol which is now widely implemented is sending BPDUs only on designated ports. Those 9 are sent during convergence activity in the past. 

You can add ip flow ingress/ip flow egress under the interface (Ethernet0 in your case). This will enable NETFLOW caching of the traffic passing through that link. No worries no risk involved. After that you can execute show ip cache-flow and you will see all the packets passing through that interface. Most probably the rest of the devices have more specific routing and default gateway is not used at all. 

Very strange topology... However in my opinion you have to add route on "Router to configure" for 192.168.10.X network pointing to PC1 ( 192.168.0.9). 

Please do the following: -shutdown the switch -press Mode button while power on the switch to enter in switch: mode. -set BAUD 115200 -flash_init -copy the file The random symbols are normal since you are transferring the file via console. So you can actually see the data flowing via the link. Just leave it for few hours and image will be uploaded. 

In this case, the hidden switch doesn't come into play. I'm running tests now and the loop is from a host on the left side of the diagram to the right side. Thanks for the feedback on this question. I was hoping to get some more concrete feedback, but I suppose since this is a tricky question, more troubleshooting is in need. Regarding gear... I've been considering a managed switch. I see that Cisco has some 10-port gigabit managed switches for under $200, which seems reasonable to me. My question is would it help to replace the 16-port unmanaged switch with a 10-port managed switch? I know that this would allow for better troubleshooting in the future, but would it also help me bottleneck issues? 

Not all together happy with how this post turned out, but I've learned things that I didn't know before, so that's good. For example, normally if two nodes (A and B) are connected to a switch which is on the downstream side of another device like your firewall, the switch will route packets from A -> B and vise versa without contacting anything upstream (from @Tedwin). I decided to post my own answer with the good parts from the comments with @Panther Modern. 

Latency can be extracted from iperf test, but I'd recommend adding SLA probes via some external software like this one 

You can attach cisco switch with two PCs behind the router. Dot1q trunking can be used with 1 vlan per PC for traffic generation and second one for SLA probes. The router must be used for inter-vlan routing, traffic shaping also should be configured here. IPERF/JPERF can be used for traffic generation. On both switch ports you can mark the traffic with specific DSCP value, which needs to be used later in the policy. Speed can be easily measured with IPERF: 

Imagine a situation when packet arrives at the first router and it's size is nearly to the MTU of the physical egress port of the router, then it is encapsulated with IPSEC headers. Those additional headers will probably exceed the MTU of the egress port In such situation the packet is going to be fragmented after encryption - post-fragmentation. Of course this forces the remote IPsec peer to perform reassembly before decryption. You can avoid post-fragmentation if you set the MTU in the upstream data path to ensure that fragmentation occurs before encryption (prefragmentation). Prefragmentation is really important from performance perspective because it is moving the reassembly task from the remote IPSEC peer to the end host. 

In mobile networks, the voice call data is Channel Switched and there is no packets.In Packet Switched data networks information is transferred in packets. Also there are different protocols and technologies in the different interfaces in the mobile network. Interfaces like the ones between the user equipment and the basestation, and other protocols an technologies between the basestation and the core network. If you are asking about the GSM Networks, the radio interface each frequency is divided to time-slots and each of them can contain several types of logical channels for signaling or voice traffic. This is TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access). Each subscriber is using the radio channel within specific time interval is a cycle. Basically all the subscribers in the cell are using the channel in a cyclic order. The channel carrying speech is called traffic channel (TCH). It carries digital speech data. The process of forming this data is roughly the following: 

RSSI is the total received power over the whole 5Mhz UMTS carrier (if you are talking about 3G). This power includes the power of the common channels (which can be configured), the dedicated channels which have power control and the HSDPA, and the same powers coming from adjacent cells. RSSI depends on cell load, but it also depends on many other factors and practically it can't be used to assess the cell load. The other factors which affect the RSSI value are: 

In addition to that you will need mls qos trust on the trunk facing the SW, which is doing the classification and mls qos enable on the SW itself 

If you really want to explore the topic for measuring optimizing TCP perfromance I'd recommend to read RFC-6349 

More specific match is always going to be selected, so all the traffic will go to 234. You can't control how other ASNs are going to do their routing. If they decide to announce more specific static via redistribution then all the traffic will use it. However in normal situation ISP is not going to use static routes for subnet which is not part of their address space. 

The thing is that you have an MPLS network in the middle of your traceroute. Actually results from traceroute are not really accurate when it comes to MPLS environment. What happens is that all ICMP TTL exceeded messages originated by a P device first have to be tunneled to the other edge using the original label stack before being sent back to the originator of traceroute operation. Therefore, you will always see end-to-end RTT across the provider core in the output. You need to trace from PE router toward a provider-scoped IP address to resolve this "layering" problem and observe proper RTT. NOTE: DNS resolving is correctly configured. 

I was wondering if only the user plane traffic is going through the direct tunnel or a part of the control plane is going through it, too. More specifically I want to know if all the PDP Context activations are counted in the SGSN. 

Speech Analog to digital conversion Grouping the digital audio signals into 20 msec speech frames Using codec to compress the voice data Adding protection bits (checksum) and some service information The formed block is transmitted within one timeslot of the TCH 

If we have mobile network with working 3GDT then a big part of the 3G data traffic goes through the direct tunnel. This is for offloading the SGSN. 

WAP is still used. I don't know which version it is. It's usage is really small. In our network it generates 200-300 times smaller traffic compared to the other mobile Internet traffic (http, ftp and other). I don't know why it is still used. Maybe some companies have old devices which are using this protocol - like taxi, tracking, cash terminals, or other similar devices (this is just an example - I'm not sure if these devices actually use WAP). 

RSSI is RF measure which represents the received power. In 3G, power is related to capacity. If we have a cell with max power 20W and pilot channel of 2W then the rest of the power (18W) is for users. Each user takes small part of this power until it is all consumed. 

1) Issue the flash_init command and the load_helper command switch: flash_init switch: load_helper 2) Issue the dir flash: command in order to view the contents of the Flash file system. After you have verified where the Cisco IOS image file resides, try to boot the image. Issue either the 

Most probably you have an application issue on the server listening to the traffic and it is not sending IGMP messages correctly. You can solve the problem by adding ip igmp static group to the outgoing interface. 

I have personally done that ARP timeout set to 60 sec for a single VLAN caused 0.05% ARP usage on cisco 29XX series. It is running like that for over a month. No problems at all. Still I'd not recommend using the network for solving clustering problems. 

When the routers on either end of a BGP session first boot, the session between them is in the Idle state. The BGP session remains idle until a start event is detected. Typically, the start event is the configuration of a new BGP session or the resetting of an existing BGP session. At boot time, the start event is generated by the router as the BGP session is initiated. After it detects a start event, the BGP host sends TCP request packets to its configured BGP neighbors. These packets are directed only to neighboring interfaces that have been explicitly configured as BGP neighbors. Upon receipt of the TCP request packet, the neighboring host generates a TCP response to complete the three-way handshake and establish a TCP connection between the peers. While this handshake is taking place, the BGP state for the connection is Connect. If a TCP timeout occurs while the originating host is waiting for a TCP response packet, the BGP state for the connection is Active. The Active state indicates that the router is actively listening for a TCP response and the TCP retry timer has been initiated. Once a TCP connection has been established between both ends of a BGP session, the BGP session state is OpenSent, indicating that the originating router has generated an open message. The open message is an initial BGP handshake that must occur before any route advertisement can take place. Upon receipt of the open message, the neighboring router generates a keepalive message. Receipt of the keepalive message establishes a point-to-point connection, and the BGP session state transitions to Established. While the originating host waits for the keepalive response packet, the BGP session state is OpenConfirm. Source of the information
