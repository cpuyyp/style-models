Once you have this done, it's just a matter of passing this data from view to view. When you pass it to the world map, it'll create the right sprite and render the player location, and allow you to move him. When you pass it to the battle view, it'll recreate the right sprites, display health, turns, etc. So the answer is not "new class" or "subclass," the answer is "extract your data from your current view and pass that around instead." 

This will help you stay organized and tweak the order of generation if you need to (eg. spawn point first, then boss, or vice-versa). With respect to fixed items, you should probably place those first, and then generate everything else around them. Also, as mentioned in Tapio's answer, you may want to dump the final map out to a file in some format that you can easily review to see what the final dungeon looks like. 

Now, to check for multi-touch, just expose and check that . That means there were two or more things touched at the same time. Also, you should be returning , not , if you've already handled clicks in your multiplexer methods. 

I'm interested in dabbling in Nintendo DS, 3DS, or GBA development. I would like to know what my (legal) options for development tools and IDEs are. In particular, I would not consider moving in this direction unless I can find: 

When you have many, many types of armour (like in RPGs), it provides a different gradation of difficulty -- as enemies get stronger, you can trade cash (which is abundant) for incremental armour updates. Beats grinding to level up lots. In all cases, armour (especially powerful armour) provides damage absorption. If combined with a mechanic like destructable armour, this can create interesting tactical elements -- you search hard for high-powered armour, but it blows up on a horde of weak enemies. 

You're right on track with using the context only from a single thread. You can only use an OpenGL context from one thread at a time, but you can do everything else in another thread. 

The texture sampling function expects texture coordinates to be normalized into the [0 - 1] range. You can divide by the size of the DuDv map in pixels, to normalize your texture coordinate into the [0 - 1] scale. For the sake of efficiency, I prefer to evaluate on the CPU, and use multiplication instead of division in your shader. 

I arrived at my assumptions because your offsetting code in the vertex shader seems to indicate that your variable is measured in pixels, not normalized: 

And for good measure, here's the tool I wrote to generate those images. Using SDL and plain C, I called it "hbm2tnm.c" (Height Bump Map to Tangent Normal Map) 

This time the Adjusted Jump Speed is being forced non-negative; If the player is already rising faster than they should be able to jump, they would attain a negative adjusted speed, which allows them to use the "jump" action as brakes. (to slow down to the intended jump speed instantly!) Note: I believe your contact X and Y are already normalized as a pair. I included explicit detail for completeness sake though. 

I have obtained an implicit solution, and although it looks like it could maybe be solved by the W function in closed form, we would then need to implement the W function in C++, so I have not investigated that. Instead, I have taken the approach of reformulating the problem as root-finding, and numerically approximating the soluiton using Newton's Method. This strategy has yielded the following fixed point iteration: 

Based on this, next wave, you might change the distribution to 40% , 35% , and 25% . This provides a procedurally-generated, but highly customized form of gameplay: players will see something different depending on their skill, and they can change their strategy from game to game. It could quickly become frustrating though, if they always have the same gameplay style. 

However, games require complex and varied art; anything from backgrounds to icons, sprites, animation, and complex effects. How do I bridge the gap, artistically? I already have the experience and confidence that I can do it; I only need to know the direction in which to put my modest efforts. I know this will pay off, especially in the long term. But I'm not sure how to get there. Using existing art is something I already do, so please don't address that in your question. 

It sounds like you're struggling with basic object-orientation. There are really two ways you can do this: 

Disclaimer: This doesn't exactly answer your question. However, I have attempted to (briefly) mention some points that may be of interest to you. The reason that you see so much about C++ is because C++ is still the industry standard -- the most common language for consoles, etc. Java is not frequently used. Minecraft is a pretty popular game that made it big with Java; but it's not that great graphically. Spiral Knights is not bad -- also made in Java, with significant graphics. If you like Java, C# is very similar in syntax, with the advantage that it can interop with C++ -- so low-level stuff can be done in C++ if necessary. Unity can use C# for scripting, and XNA is an excellent choice. Again, Java is not widely used. If you like the style and syntax, I think you'll find C# to be a very similar, very pleasant coding experience. I hope your dreams make it, it's a lot of fun along the way :) 

Ugly. But we have a closed form solution in time :) Before we can solve for the parameters you're interested in, we have to address one small ambiguity: The damped harmonic oscillator never stops, only decays. I will use a threshold where we consider motion "stopped", and solve for the peak which attains this amplitude. Now, from the solution above, I have obtained that the set of peaks are generated by: 

There is no canonical "correct way" to approximate general functions. Sorry. With that said, the very source you linked to has suggested the Lafortune representation. This representation has been described as "...compact and works well for hardware rendering..." in chapter 18 of GPU Gems. Implementation details appear to be out of scope for this question. 

The simplest way to take advantage would be to do all the loading as you normally would, but send some kind of "event" back to your main thread to actually call the OpenGL upload with everything already prepared. 

Variance shadow mapping, plainly put, just suffers from these light bleeding issues. I personally prefer to implement ESM (check out page 257 of ShaderX6) as the memory pressure is half of the VSM map and the artifacts are much less abrasive to me: (The very beginning of the shadow is a bit too bright.) With this said, here is a (rather old) PDF full of great techniques to get you thinking. (or just to show you the algorithm if you don't have ShaderX6) $URL$ In my current engine, I have a hybrid which is basically ESM, but uses the 2-moment (or higher) shadow map to compute the variance and reduce the ESM artifacts at the places where the occluder is too close to the receiver. 

A simple google search of "top game design schools" offered me a lot of top searches already. This one seems to be from princetonreview is credible because it's known a lot for its rankings of top party schools and other quality-of-life ratings of college. $URL$ I suggest checking the other links when doing a google search and you'd get more information out of it. 

You could create an abstract class which contains all the variables. And then have this class and another class that you're planning to have similar variables both extend the abstract class. 

I didn't have extensive knowledge on C# nor even Java when I started using XNA. At best, I actually just had an equivalent of a person who just finished beginning Java course knowledge level-wise. But because of this experience in XNA, I actually learned a lot more and it's actually been helping in my courses at school. Overall what I'm saying is that you'll learn more as you program on it. If you find that you don't know how to implement a feature or how to tackle it, google searching helps. In the end, all I can see when you try to use other things (in this case, XNA) is that you learn more. The more you know and experience, the better you are as a programmer. 

If you meant by developer is programmer, I'd really like to correct that. Developer means any person that has a role in the development of the game. Consists of roles: Producer, Programmer, Artist, and Sound are the most basic high-level position in video game development. "A game developer is anyone who has any involvement with the creation of the game at all. Engineers, animators, modelers, musicians, writers, producers and designers who work on games are all game developers." (qtd. from The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell) If you really meant programmer/engineer when you said developer, then they are the ones who "program" the game; as in, putting all the pieces of the game - ideas, arts, sound, implementation, etc - into a whole playable state. Designer, on the other hand, are the ones who "designs" the features in the game. Not strictly into just ideas, but rather, much more in-depth than that. Designers focus on giving details about how game features are going to be implemented. This doesn't mean they are the only ones who are limited to doing that, but it is the position where it's their sole role to think through things more in-depth. Typically, design just means "decisions about how the game should be" (qtd. Jesse Schell). But in reality says it's much more stricter than that if you mean the job position "game designer." Game Designers tend to have the most demanding wide variety of skills because you have to consider as many things as possible, including but not limited to business, animation, mathematics, music, communication, technical writing, psychology, and much more. It doesn't mean that you have to have all those skills, but the more knowledge you know the better. 

Color keying: Check if the alpha or color is equal to a magic cutout value. Alpha partitions: Obtain separate specular and transparency values using line equations. 

The fix is simple, integrate position in the middle of integrating velocity. (As in, add half of the force, update, then add the other half.) Here is a more in-depth explanation: $URL$ 

The "best" option is to try it yourself and see what's faster. I will put my money on option 1 being faster. You will only gain performance benefit this way if the pillar is incredibly expensive to draw, and you use effective culling. 

Sounds like you are asking for a convex hull, this is sortof like "gift wrapping" all your vertices. (Otherwise, if the shape can be concave you cannot imply it by the vertices alone) Wikipedia has a good list of techniques here: $URL$ And google code even has an implementation (I haven't tested this): $URL$ 

Which is our answer, notice that time is still unknown in this system. This means there are infinite trajectories that will land on the purple rectangle. You have to decide how long it should take. 

Sampling the heightmap with a clamping mode produces an output like such: Or with a wrapping mode, produces what was shown in your comment: (Including the errors around the border) 

The Pannini projection, for example, can capture wide fields of view in nice ways. (totally just my opinion) I think implementation details would be beyond the scope of this specific question.
