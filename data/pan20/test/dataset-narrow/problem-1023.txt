I have a lenovo t-440. I have had seizures and now can't remember what I used to do in order to have function keys behave as I like/want them to be. For instance on all my desktops its CTRL+ALT+Fn$` in order to get to a germinal shell One method which is shared by people here is Make function keys behave as normal on a Lenovo laptop but that's not the method AFAI remember that I used. Does anybody know fo any alternate methodology for the same. 

Wanted to know if people know of any major differences between identify --verbose and exiftool. A picture here :- 

The only sha1sum (seems no sha256sum) for MS-Windows was done by one of the GNUPG people way back in 2004. See $URL$ and the binary can be seen browsed/looked at ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/ With github and such public-facing repositories has somebody superseded that release. I am looking for a tool which is able to check hashes of any .iso image or just plain applications, provided hashes have been provided by the .iso provider to check them against. In Unix I can simply do :- 

If it's some streaming site, and you're just watching videos, a dirty trick is open twice, and mute one, just start a bit later or sooner one of both, as needed.(but vlc feature mentioned above is preferrable) Another "fast" trick, in case you are encoding not just watching, is in a video editor that allows handling audio track separately (ie: Sony Vegas Studio), just move this audio track as needed, with a bit of trial and error. There are better ways, but these are sort of basic/simple. 

Set "maximum compressi√≥n" or "Best compression" setting in winzip dialog. Or use a better algorythm, this is possible with a compressor like 7zip, using 7zip format. Though the gain often does not worth for the usual stuff. LZMA is a great algorythm for compression, but is not in every software. Beware: EXEs do compress badly,(check if you're leaving exes in a folder and he's not) there are specialized exe compressors. Again, it all depends on how much do you really need to make lighter packages, in relation with time and effort put in it. Winzip standard everything, or Winrar, is anyway a good way to ensure the thing arrives with no probs, often people cannot open certain file if compressed in certain manner. I work with a friend of mine tho, and as is just to work together, we use 7zip, with 7z format and highest compression settings. 

Is there a way to batch generate snapshots every 2-3 minutes or so in Debian. I have a video of approximately 15 minutes and while I could use hotekey 's' to manually generate snapshots . Using vlc 2.2.4 Weathermax. 

The firefox url bar has some of auto-prediction built-in. Whenever I try to write something the auto-prediction kicks in. I do end up killing a few of the entries using shift+delete . But is there a way to en-masse kick the links ? 

at first glance identify --verbose seems to be telling more about the image than exiftool, are there any interesting things that people can point out ? 

I have tried it two times already and each time I hit some or the other road-block. AFAIU it, both Windows 10 and any GNU/Linux say Debian can live each happily with each other. Now I have a 4 TB HDD put as a gpt disk. Now when I do install the OS, I do it this way - a. Windows 10 with /boot f. After Windows Installation is all done, then install debian and use grub2 so it finds both the distros. and do the best it can. Now with Linux, it is easy mapping out the needs - a. grub2 shows something like this - 

This is the most vectorial you can go, as far as I know.If you had like 20 photo layers bellow. You could just make a group of the 20, then just drag and drop the star shape thumb (all this operating in layers list) over the group: All the layers will be masked with the star! With teh advantage that if you modify the star, all bellow will be masked according to that change :) If it's 20 or 150. You could now alt + click over each layer eye icon to visualize only that and export as png or whatever, or just use File menu, Scripts, Export layer to files. 

Some advice: you may want to give it a try to : Super Fdisk ( ptdd.com ), gparted, or...partition magic. Sometimes in the past I needed one of those to delete a linux partition...Indeed, usually old fdisk tended to be great for these deletions. 

for ext there is something called ext2ifs $URL$ but unfortunately the development of the tool hasn't been satisfactory ( at least for me) see how it was last released in 2015 and with incomplete ext4 feature-list. I had tried to talk to the developer but he wasn't forthcoming in any details for the future. 

And provided I have hash checksum and a binary and the binary is there in the drive, it will check and if it's the same, will say 

I am somewhat confused as putting a large area for /boo encourages reserved and other such directories under Windows 10. I am open to the idea of starting from scratch i.e. install windows 10 again but not sure how to tackle the partitioning so that /boot or /boot/efi so can anybody give me advice as to how to proceed further if I start with a clean slate. 

I have a wifi connection whose password I know and I want to sniff all the data packets on this network with my computer. What is the best tool for this purpose on windows? I am lookinf for something free but functionality like $URL$ or Commview 

I was installing some software and it said that the locking criteria is the system UUID. Now I know what UUID stands for. I know they are unique and are 128 bits long. I know how to generate them from a windows power shell. But my question is what is the system UUID on a windows 7 machine. Where is it stored. And what is the purpose behind having a UUID for every computer? Could someone please clear these doubts for me? What are they used for apart from verifying that the same software is not installed again on the same computer? 

You could try Coppermine free web gallery. At BitNami you can find mac, linux and windows installers for it. (so, adressing well those compatibility issues) I think it would support all which you mention. 

er... Sorry if I give a too obvious answer... There's a quick way to see basic info, very basic, for this. In windows, just right click on the file, Properties, "Summary" tab, then hit button "advanced". Again, sorry if is too obvious to mention this. 

It happened to me with a previous 3.1x Thunderbird version. Maybe upgrade to 3.1.9. Might be some setting in html composing settings, or , I also noticed a boost when unmarked global index and search checkbox at Preferences/Advanced , General tab. Other things I did not try (as an update solved it) were deactivate grammar auto checking, use only non html composing, etc. It might be that you have it configured as typing in text only mode, but there's a setting at composing settings, in preferences which give you several options, and default I think is type in html, rich format, if the original wrtitter was doing so. So would happen only in replies, not in a new blank message. 

I am using windows 8. When I install some application and search for it using the new Start menu it doesnt appear to show. This is very frustrating since I have to manually go to the location in order to run the program. Is there any way to add a program to the windows start menu? 

I have a long string of hex characters which I need to be converted to ascii , decimal and several other formats. The hexcode is separated by brackets and I wanted to know if there is any free tool for the windows platform which will do this job for me? 

I have a lan adapter connected on my pc. However the first time I power it on it doesnt appear in the adapter setting and I have no internet connectivity. I have to restart the computer for me to get internet connectivity, It then appears in the adapter settings. Could anyone give me some pointers since this as a daily affair is kind of time consuming.
