I am interested in the classic problem REGULAR LANGUAGE INCLUSION. Given a regular expression $E$, we denote by $L(E)$ the regular language associated to it. (Regular expressions are on a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, with the operations union, Kleene-star and concatenation.) Input: Two regular expressions $E_1$ and $E_2$ Question: Is it true that $L(E_1)\subseteq L(E_2)$? REGULAR LANGUAGE INCLUSION is known to be PSPACE-complete [1]. The classic way to solve it (in PSPACE) is to construct the NFAs $A_1$ and $A_2$ associated to $E_1$ and $E_2$, to build a DFA $D_2$ from $A_2$, complement it into a DFA $D_2^C$, and finally, build the intersection automaton $A_P$ from $A_1$ and $D_2^C$ corresponding to the intersection of $L(E_1)$ and $L(E_2)^C$. Now $L(E_1)\subseteq L(E_2)$ if and only if there no an accepting path in $A_P$. If I am not mistaken, the whole process can be done in polynomial time when $E_2$ is a fixed language, since the only exponential blow-up comes from transforming $A_2$ into $D_2$. Even better, the problem is FPT when parameterized by $|E_2|$, the length of $E_2$. This motivates my question: 

I am interested in the complexity of the dominating set problem (DSP) in some specific graph classes which are subclasses of chordal graphs. A graph is an undirected path graph if it is the vertex-intersection graph of a family of paths in some undirected tree. Let UP be the class of undirected path graphs. A graph is an EPT graph if it is the edge-intersection graph of a family of paths in some undirected tree. An EPT graph may not be chordal, but let CEPT be the class of chordal EPT graphs. A graph is a (rooted) directed path graph if it is the vertex-intersection graph of a family of directed paths in some rooted directed tree (i.e. all arcs directed away from the root). Let RDP be the class of (rooted) directed path graphs. We have $RDP\subseteq CEPT \subseteq UP\subseteq chordal$ It is known that the DSP is linear-time solvable for graphs in RDP but NP-complete for graphs of UP [Booth and Johnson, 1981] I am interested in special graphs which correspond to vertex-intersection graphs of families of undirected paths in caterpillar-like trees of maximum degree 3. More precisely, these "caterpillars" are built from a path in which each second vertex has a pendant degree-one-vertex attached to. Let us call this class cat-UP. Moreover, my special graphs can also be constructed as the edge-intersection graphs of some families of undirected paths in specific trees of maximum degree 3. So my questions are: 1) Is the complexity of the DSP for graphs of cat-UP known ? (note that the reduction in [Booth and Johnson, 1981] produces a host tree which is of maximum degree 3, but quite far from a caterpillar) 2) What is the complexity of DSP for graphs of CEPT ? And for graphs of CEPT arising form a host tree of maximum degree 3 ? (this is not known to ISGCI) 3) Is there any complexity result for the DSP in a closely related graph family ? 

Given a fixed directed graph (digraph) $D$, the $D$-COLORING decision problem asks whether an input digraph $G$ has a homomorphism to $D$. (A homomorphism of $G$ to $D$ is a mapping $f$ of $V(G)$ to $V(D)$ that preserves the arcs, that is, if $uv$ is an arc of $G$, then $f(u)f(v)$ is an arc of $D$.) The class of $D$-COLORING problems is strongly connected to the Dichotomy Conjecture for CSPs stated by Feder and Vardi (accessible on citeseer). In this 2001 paper (accessible on the author's page, here), Feder proves a dichotomy theorem when $D$ is an oriented cycle (by oriented cycle I mean an undirected cycle where each edge is replaced by a single arc, that can be oriented arbitrarily), in other words, he shows that for any oriented cycle $D$, $D$-COLORING is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-complete. Unfortunately, Feder's classification is highly nontrivial and not explicit, as the complexity of many cases is related to the complexity of certain restricted variants of SAT that depend on the orientation. By looking at the paper, I have not been able to determine the answer to my question: 

1) To refine daniello's answer, there is a standard bound in domination that for any graph of minimum degree $d$, there is a dominating set of size at most (roughly) $\frac{\log d}{d}n$. This bound has a simple and nice probabilistic proof (similar to the one given by daniello); see for example Theorem 1.2.2 in the Alon-Spencer book The probabilistic method (there the exact bound they give is $\frac{1+\ln (d+1)}{d+1}n$). Moreover the bound is known to be asymptotically tight. See this paper by Alon, also available on the author's webpage, for the tightness (in the language of hypergraph transversals). Note that for small values of $d$, it is an active field of research to determine the best bound, and the situation is not yet fully understood already for small $d$; see this paper for a nice discussion about this, as well as some early references for the above bound. Now, when $d=n^k$, the bound gives a dominating set of size roughly $kn^{1-k}\ln n$, about the same as what we get from daniello's answer. I don't know whether the Alon construction is tight for such values of $d$, but my guess would be yes. 2) A second easy observation is that when the degrees are bounded by above (say by $\Delta$), any vertex can dominate at most $\Delta+1$ vertices and hence any dominating set has size at least $\frac{n}{\Delta+1}$. This is easily seen to be tight by creating a graph from a collection of disjoint stars with $\Delta$ leaves each (potentially adding a few edges to make it connected). 

Since there are $2^{|X'|}$ subsets of $X'$, we have $|X'|\leq\log_2(|\mathcal S|)$, and hence VC DIMENSION can be solved in time $O\binom{|X|}{\log_2(|\mathcal S|)}$. For the hardness side, VC DIMENSION is LOGNP-hard (see here). However, I wonder whether something is known for the following specific case: 

In the same flavour as the answer by Y. Okamoto, there is an easy argument showing that the dominating set problem admits an $(\ell-1)$-approximation algorithm in induced $K_{1,\ell}$-free graphs. Indeed, just take any independent dominating set $I$ (i.e. a maximal independent set): we have the chain of inequalities $\frac{\alpha(G)}{\ell-1}\leq \gamma(G)\leq I\leq\alpha(G)$, where $\gamma(G)$ and $\alpha(G)$ are the domination number and independence number of $G$, respectively (see here, Lemma 1 for a proof of, in particular, the first inequality). 

Theorem (6.4 in [1]): If $G$ has no pan and no even hole as an induced subgraph, then $tw(G)\leq 3\omega(G)/2-2$. Theorem (5.4 in [2]): If $G$ is odd-signable, has no clique cutset and has no cap nor any 4-cycle as an induced subgraph, then $tw(G)\leq 6\omega(G)-1$. (In particular, this holds if $G$ has no clique cutset and has no cap and no even hole as an induced subgraph.) [1] K. Cameron, S. Chaplick, C. T. Hoang. On the structure of (pan, even hole)-free graphs, 2015. $URL$ [2] K. Cameron, M. V. G. da Silva, S. Huang, K. Vušković. Structure and algorithms for (cap, even hole)-free graphs, 2016. $URL$ 

Note: in Lanberg's 1998 master thesis, a stronger result than Petrank's is proved (the hardness remains valid for a wide range of values of $k$), but only for graphs of maximum degree 30 (see Lemma 3.1). I do not know if other results of APX-hardness for the problem exist in the literature. 

It is known that planar graphs admit "good" separators, allowing to design PTASes for specific problems such as MINIMUM INDEPENDENT SET by recursive separation of the graph. However, it seems that this specific approach does not lead to a PTAS for the MINIMUM DOMINATING SET problem (MDS), whereas other approaches do, see E. D. Demaine and M. Hajiaghayi: Approximation Schemes for Planar Graph Problems (1983, 1984; Baker). In T. Nieberg and J. Hurink: A PTAS for the Minimum Dominating Set Problem in Unit Disk Graphs (also accessible here), the authors define the notion of 2-separated sets, that is, a collection of subsets of vertices of a graph such that two vertices from different sets are at distance at least two from each other. If a graph admits such a set (with additional suitable properties), they prove that MDS admits a PTAS. This is the case for unit disk graphs for example. This notion is really similar to the technique of recursive separators in planar graphs, except for the distance-2 requirement. So my question: Do good (in the sens of usual separators) "distance-2-separators" exist in planar graphs, and if yes, can we compute them efficiently? 

On this page a theorem is mentioned that provides such classes: Theorem (Scheffler [1]) If $G$ is the intersection graph of connected subgraphs of another graph $H$, then $tw(G)\leq tw(H)\omega(G)-1$. This generalizes the bound for chordal graphs (for which $H$ is a tree) and also applies to circular-arc graphs (then $H$ is a cycle). I do not know if other "standard" classes are captured by this theorem. [1] P. Scheffler, What graphs have bounded tree-width? Rostocker Math. Kolloq. 41 (1990) 31-38. 

Notes: 1) I could not find a reference for this question, including in this standard textbook about domination, where Chapter 8 is devoted to the complexity of the (decision problem) dominating set. 2) It is NP-hard to approximate the MDSP within $o(log(n))$ in another subclass of chordal graphs, split graphs. This follows from an easy reduction from minimum set cover (see here). 3) I think the original NP-hardness reduction for undirected path graphs from the above reference can be used to show that the MDSP admits no PTAS in this class of graphs. But would this be tight? 

I am interested in the complexity of the minimum dominating set problem (MDSP) in some specific graph class. A graph is an undirected path graph if it is the vertex-intersection graph of a family of paths in some undirected tree (this is a subclass of chordal graphs). It is known that the MDSP is NP-hard when considering undirected path graphs (see here). My question is: 

Edit: Let me give more details on Feder's classification. Feder shows that any NP-complete oriented cycle must be balanced, that is, have the same number of arcs in both directions (hence it has even order). Then, consider the "levels" induced by the orientation (start to go around the cycle at an arbitrary vertex; if an arc goes right, you go up by 1, if an arc goes left, you go down by 1). Then, if there is at most one "top-bottom run", it is polynomial. If there are at least 3 such "runs" and the cycle is a core, it is NP-complete. (In András' example from the comments, there are three such "runs", but the cycle is not a core.) The most tricky cases are those with two "top-bottom runs". Some are hard, some polynomial, and Feder relates them to special SAT problems to obtain a dichotomy. I guess one could make a case-by-case analysis and see what kind of SAT problem it corresponds to... As an intermediate question: What is the smallest oriented cycle that has three "top-bottom" runs and is a core? Such an example would be NP-complete by the above discussion.
