Unable to change it. Thanks to $URL$ I looked for the Jessie version of ifupdown sources, and per the change log: 

ExFat deletes files by marking each file and directory entry with a symbol (0xe5 as the first byte), and also removing the pointer to the file entry so that the blocks are freed up. There is no second file table, so once it is done, it is not feasible to correct. AFAIK there is no other method to undelete a file with ExFat on linux. 

As the title says, does Windows (10/Anniversary/Creators Update) log the creation of Compressed Folders or Zip Files? Is this tracked in Event Viewer, or any debug log? An employee had attempted to create a zip file, but evidently missed a file. This has become an issue due to missing a deadline due to the file being absent. Need to see if this was an issue of user error. 

Theoretically yes. You can lock the lower level storage and prevent the file table from being edited. Or recreate the file each time. In practice, it's easier to spilt it up. The U3 or security type drives show up as two partitions or a CD and usb drive partition. One is read only the other is read writable. 

Using Debian Jessie (on a Seagate Dockstar), it has DHclient for it's dhcp client. The damn thing is being started with: 

Less a solution as others have provided the practical ones, but an explanation. The way Sony and other vendors typically handle this is through checking for USB VID/PID pairs, the 4 digit Vendor and Product ID numbers that are supposed to be unique to every USB product. Some products are generic and use the same id's, often based on the chipset used inside. It could be that Sony bought and paid for a unique pair for their custom device, or that they took a off the shelf Ralink wifi module and rebranded it. In that case you can find a compatible module and use it directly. This happens often. In the former, it also happens to be rebranded, but the chipset allows you to rewrite the usb pair used via special software. A final option requires a device with open or modded firmware, where you add your VID/PID pair to the driver so it recognize it the same. All if these are common in consumer electronics, including Sony TVs, and Vizio tvs, Wii Ethernet and wifi adapters, etc. 

Yes. Apple had a target display mode, which allowed a mac with a display port or thunderbolt port to work as external gpu/display for another mac. This has not been widely copied. There is nothing preventing a second computer to act as a external gpu other than programming time/development. 

As it uses standard ATX voltages and colors, the quickest way to use a new supply would have been to remove the molex connecter from the old supply and put it on the new supply. Video of how it's done: $URL$ You can use a simple jewelers screwdriver, a paperclip, even a straightened staple. It's not hard at all. There are dedicated tools if you want. The tangs need to be pushed in a bit then the wire with pin can be slid out. 

(Side note, many flavors of Linux now support TRRS headsets, if the hardware it's on support it as well.) 

VGA to HDMI converters are very common, someone lied to you. As for your HDMI to VGA, 1 needs to be supported by your video card, 2 is what you need (ymmv, but the amazon comments look good), 3 is a VGA to HDMI, opposite of what you want. Alternatively, spend a couple of bucks and upgrade to a newer monitor. Get in this century. 

Your specific laptop can take up to 8 gigs of DDR3 memory, so you may want to upgrade if the memory saved for graphics processing is an issue. 

If both the G network and the N network have the same name, the wifi client will treat them as the same network, switching to whichever signal is supposedly strongest. That may be the 2.4ghz g, 2.4ghz n, or 5ghz n. Depends on the radiation in your vicinity. If the g and n networks have separate unique names, it's like two separate networks as far as the wireless is concerned. The client won't jump between them. This may be useful if you know the G is garbage due to overuse or wireless congestion, but still need the G for non-n clients. If you can set the two with unique names is up to the firmware in your router. Typically it will be in the advance wireless setup section. If you can, there may also be an option to segregate the two wireless networks as vlans as well. Same could apply to the wireless vs wired. This would put each on their own lan. 

Attempting to turn a line level signal into a mic level signal will not provide the best quality. The easiest method would be a dollar usb sound card. Plug and play line level in. 

Wifi and bluetooth traffic is easy enough to check for. Any number of 802.11x or Bluetooth devices support a promiscuous monitor mode. It allows a passive checking of all standard formatted traffic. To check if the wifi or bluetooth module is mostly off, you could wire in a ammeter. I believe the last five years, these modules are now non optional, but still modular, so you'd have to take the laptop apart to reach them. Alternatively you could just disconnect them. The small amount of EMF you are seeing would be from the high frequency switching done by the cpu, gpu, and even the battery regulator. You could do a baseline by checking multiple laptops. 

It really depends on the drivers and how the OS handles it. Apple for example uses wifi devices that can access all 802.11b/g/n channels, but limits it to US channels when in the US, UK channels in the UK, Japanese Channels in Japan. I Cannot access channel 14 when my location is set to US, as the US does not allow channel 14. It physically can work, but won't due to a user selectable setting. Your device should be fine though. Windows doesn't discriminate like OS X does. Apple goes beyond the necessary all the time. If anything, the device will not accept, connect to, or show the channels beyond the default US ones, which may be inconvenient if you move around a lot, but easily fixed on a home router. I will update on the Australia vs US differences later, if any. 

A regular 3.5mm stereo male to male cable, typically known as a patch or aux cable, is needed. The jack is a 3.5mm trs connector. 

Assuming your laptop board doesn't have a battery to charge, and no lcd/inverter to power, then lets round the power up to 20W to account for peak draw. Power = Voltage * Current, so the opposite is Current = Power / Voltage. At 19V, 20W of power is 1.052 Amps. That means only 1/3rd of the 3.42 Amps available from the power supply are unused. You have 45 Watts of power free. The Drive supply is 12V * 1.5A = 18 Watts. Even with a step down regulator efficiency of 80%, you have plenty of power available. 

It's because while a typical computer may only need 300 Watts, this is just a baseline model. Many towers can be upgraded for multiple disc and hard drives. Most can support multiple accessory cards, like PCI or AGP. Some video cards are extremely power hungry. You have to include full draw on multiple USB ports, with USB 3.0 getting into 10 or more Watts per port. People often need 800 Watt supplies because they have computers that need 800 Watts. That said, a modern cpu like a Core i7 has a typical wattage rating of 130W, not 50W. A secondary reason that many pcs have higher rated supplies than needed is because of the mass production of computers have lead to these supplies being cheap to produce en mass. Instead of stocking a few of multiple wattage supplies, a OEM uses a bunch of a single rating. Bull discounts. 

Note, it's only supported in OSX, not Bootcamp/Windows, AFAIK. Any computer with USB 3 Type-C connector could/should possibly support it as well. 

Do this for the 10 pin connector on the old supply, and on two 4 pin connectors on the new supply. Fix the tangs by pulling them out a bit and insert the wires into the 10 pin connector. No need to cut/solder an adapter. 

Three options. If your board has an internal header of 1" pins for 2 usb ports, a standard internal usb connector would work. If not, then use a PCI usb card for the same. Or you can use a usb male to usb female, a usb extender cable to run two external usb ports on the back to the front. 

WirelessKeyView can access external Windows/Registry files. If you can mount the old drive, that's the easiest way. If not, and you have the registry hive file, you simply need to recreate the directory layout. Place the software hive in and point WirelessKeyView to and it should work. 

That is a resounding NO. USB and Ethernet can't be spliced in with a simple wire. You either need an adaptor (A Network Access Storage/NAS) or you need a router that supports USB devices, which frankly are a dime a dozen. 

Can you? Sure. Should you? No. Quality of the voltage will drop, and the back and forth Ac to dc to Ac to dc to Ac to dc will be inefficient. Get a laptop or a bigger UPS. 

Yum and RPM are not normal commands of a basic OSX install. Even with the dev tools option, they are not normal commands. RPM is the Red hat Package Manager, and YUM is similar. You either need a special install for those, or use a similar package manager like Homebrew or Mac Ports. If those package managers have RPM Fusion available is another story. Basically OSX is not Red Hat Linux. If you want Virtual Box, with a Fedora virtualization, then you need to install Virtual Box, (or parallels) then install Fedora on that. You can then access regular fedora options through the virtualized Fedora. 

Testdisk, which is used for partition and file system recovery, allows you to find files listed in the file system as deleted, with the caveat of those files hopefully not having been overwritten. In this case, you can "undelete" the files, which is copying the file starting at the innodes listed, with filename and other information intact. This includes the folder hierarchy, sometimes. I just used it recover 1440 photos from a corrupt Canon Camera SD card formatted as ExFat. I could see the files on the camera, but not when I put the SD card in my Mac. Testdisk could see the corrupt/deleted folder, and I could recover the files with at least 2 levels of folder structure. This should be the same for you having used rm. Had there been an intermediate step of putting all those files in a trash or recycling bin, then it might not have your existing folder structure. The other tool that comes with TestDisk is PhotoRec, which is a low level disk analyzer that searches for file structures, ignoring the file system. This is when you delete a partition or the file system is completely hosed. As the actual data do not have names, this is done by the File System or OS, all the files would be unnamed and without folder structure. The speed of TestDisk, is essentially the same speed as any file copy, depending on the speed of your disk, computer, or OS. 

This is done from the Advanced Routing page. In your specific case, the subnet is /8, or 255.0.0.0. Gateway would be the VPN ip 192.168.0.2 

Interoperability of the file system is important. exFAT is also natively, read/write supported by OS X Snow Leopard in 10.6.5 and later (although not mentioned in the release notes). This can be verified by checking Disk Utility, where exFAT is an option for formatting. On OS X, NTFS is still considered Read only, unless you modify the fstab on a per drive basis and are willing to deal with non-native mounting. As such, it's not a reliable option for most users. While using your drive on a Mac or Linux or other system might not be your main concern, it is something to consider. 

Why do you have that setup? If you can change it, place Router 2 in bridge and/or AP mode. This means that it just acts like a switch and wireless access point, while Router 1 handles all the DHCP/DNS/Routing. Router 2 would be extending Router 1, and since everything is on the same network, the printer should show up. The other options is placing the Printer on a DMZ on Router 2. 

Alternatively, with some creative hacking, you may be able to get the power from the monitor itself. The power supply could have a spot for the 12V 1A needed, simply not wired. You would need to guess a bit after opening the monitor to see. USB is not ideal for this. You would need a step-up voltage regulator, and even assuming 100% efficiency, you would need 5V 2.5 Amps in. Most USB ports are much more limited. 

This is hard coded into ifupdown, and I would have to patch, compile, and replace to fix this "improvement". Alternatively, I need to see if BusyBox syslogd can filter this out. Yay. 

Shared Video Memory. Its likely your laptop has reserved 256mb of your 1gb for the integrated video card. In that case, no. Check your bios for the possibility of changing the specific amount put aside for VRAM. Note that it won't be zero in most cases. The only way around it is to disable the builtin video, if available. Note: 

USB specs defined two types of Devices at first. A devices, i.e. Hosts like your pc, and B Devices, i.e. Peripherals like a printer. At first, only standard size existed. Then mobile devices needing a smaller connecter, Mini-B was created. It is still for Peripherals only. Then OTG was added, creating the need for Mini-A (Miniature Host) and Mini-AB (Mixed, OTG device). So Standard A Male to Mini B Male cables are for use from a Standard Host, to a Mini Peripheral. I.E. Your PC to a Cell phone. Now, A Mini-A Male to Standard A FEMALE is allowed, as an adaptor, for OTG purposes. Mainly hooking up a standard device to a OTG host. Fairly common now. I have had tablets and phones that came with them in the box. A Mini-A Male to Standard A Male is non-standard as all heck. The color of the connector on the cable is also defined within USB Specs. Notably, USB Mini is depreciated and has been replaced by USB Micro for years now. $URL$ for an entire breakdown (simple to read) on the cable connector setup, as presented by the USB Implementers Forum. 

Aside from powering it from an external power supply, there are a few options, and highly depends on your setup. If you only want to avoid running an extra cable or something, there is C13 pass through/piggyback cables. The cable plugs into the monitor but also has a regular power outlet at the end that the regular power adapter would connect to.
