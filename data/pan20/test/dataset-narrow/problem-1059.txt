As DestroyTwitter did get captured, I assume Fiddler has changed the system wide proxy settings. Hence, I guess the third option in Firefox should work. 

After I downloaded from the AppStore, I did not find any DMG, but the installation app was (and is) in the folder. Earlier I deleted it after actually running that installer. But then some time later the AppStore had some issues with an incremental update that came in later, and which then forced me to download the very same thing again, just to be able to download the update. So I decided to leave it sitting there. (And on my Time Machine backup.) 

...shows the very same IP address. So you probably visited one of the Stack Exchange sites? Running will show you IP addresses rather than (assumed) host names. † It might even be on the same server but that is not relevant here. 

You could use a domain name like (short for "local virtual host", I think) instead of localhost. Someone registered this as a global DNS mapping to 127.0.0.1 (so, no need for any hacking in the file) and it supports subdomains, like $URL$ Or, if you don't trust the user to try other subdomains then use some random hard-to-guess subdomain. Finally, in your server side code, use the header to see who's connecting. 

This takes the positions 1, 4, 5 and 7 (and the errors) from the previous step as input for , which finds the k-th value from , or an error if is invalid. Now, still shows an error for the last rows. In Excel 2007 and later, one can use to show nothing in case of an error, like used in the very first formula above. OpenOffice does not support that, but needs , replacing both with the formula from . Not nice. Alternatively, use to include cell when getting the actual value from the first column, and then somehow make OpenOffice use if no more values are found. Like in : 

* See (slow) example at Cuzillion. And though IE8 is the first browser to download scripts in parallel, it will still not execute them in parallel. † Google tells your browser to cache it for 31,536,000 seconds, thus 365 days. And it allows for public caching, so a proxy is allowed to cache it, and use it for other clients as well. ‡ When hitting Refresh, then for cached items most browsers will add a header to the request, thus only truly downloading if the thing in the cache is outdated. But: even if the server responds with , the browser still needs to await that answer. So: hitting Refresh when things are slow might make things worse! 

Also note that this is very platform dependent. On a Mac, you'll need different formulas, as it uses different path separators. Also, it might work differently in OpenOffice.org and other alternatives. And when using on an unsaved workbook, you might get instead. When not using an array formula, you might get the name of the workbook (the last part of its file name), like so: 

Often the Windows Event Viewer (through Control Panel, Administrative Tools) shows the error including a blue link "More info". Clicking that link often takes one to a generic Microsoft web page, but sometimes it shows a detailed Microsoft Knowledge Base article about that specific error. (If not, then posting more details about the specific error message may help.) As in this case the questioner can in fact read new messages after restarting Outlook Express, I doubt one of the folders is corrupt. Just in case: The Other E-Mail Threat: File Corruption in Outlook Express. Maybe one can test for corrupt folders by doing a search for some random text in all messages? And Outlook Express has a limit for its message files of 2GB. To avoid loosing messages one should ensure those do not become too large. But this again is probably not the case for this specific question, as things are normal after restarting Outlook Express. Still, anyone using Outlook Express may want to check the size of the files, somewhere in: 

This is not a comment, but a shebang to tell your operating system to use to execute the script. But apparently Ubuntu cannot find it. 

Also note that some directories, including temporary internet files, might not be easily searchable using standard tools. (Like: Windows Explorer does not really show one the true contents of its Temporary Internet Files folder.) And temporary internet files might not have a recognizable file name extension. But that's mostly solved by clearing the temporary files. But if you used non-standard file name extensions yourself, then Windows won't help you find them unless you use some utility that relies on examining the file, including using magic numbers. Or, if you're not on Windows at all, then surely you cannot rely on file name extensions when searching, as many operating systems simply don't require such extensions. To search by examining the file contents, if possible using magic numbers, tested on a Mac: 

As you may have seen while testing: Apple Mail actually wraps the text in the message source, before sending it. So it's indeed the "format=flowed" part that makes the recipient flow those lines back into the original paragraphs. (I actually dislike messages that are NOT flowed, and would actually leave it to the client to disable it. And I love the way Apple Mail sends very feature-limited HTML mails. Apple Mail only uses HTML when really needed, and even then hardly adds any formatting -- for example: it does not force some default font size upon the recipient when I just happen to put some word in bold. So I actually switched my default from plain text to Rich Text. But: that's a matter of taste, I know.) 

When using IMAP and only keeping a yearly copy, then you're not covering the risk that somehow all your mail is lost from either Gmail or Outlook, and then after the first IMAP synchronisation (thus: as soon as you start Outlook) will be forever lost in both places. (Hence: no, it's not sufficient to keep only a yearly backup.) 

I don't know how it works, but somewhere in 2002 I used Adobe Reader to fill in an offline PDF tax-paper. Upon pressing a button within that PDF form, it prompted for my password, encrypted itself, connected to the internet, and sent itself (or its data) to the tax-collector's office. It then told me the password was actually wrong, and had me repeat the steps. So, assuming pressing a button is not really required to do this, I guess any PDF document that is actually a form can phone home when opened in a capable reader. Also, some read-only PDF forms actually always fetch the data they show from the internet. I have had some digital bills sent to me through email, which would open fine when I got them. However, some time later after the web shop had changed their web site, the bills showed up empty when I opened them again. 

Sites like Google often behave differently when copying a link or when clicking it. Like copying a link after searching for Super User, may simply give you $URL$ But when clicking it, Google will actually use JavaScript to send a HTTP POST to their server to count the fact that you clicked, and as a response they will then redirect you to the actual site. The URL being used is then something like: 

Coursera, like many websites, uses a different domain to load resources such as the CSS stylesheets, in their case a CDN from Amazon. For coursera.org, viewing the page source reveals: 

By definition, they need to be. If a name server record (like ) is within the same domain ("in the same zone") as the record that is being requested (like ), then so-called glue records are used to avoid circular references, specifying both the domain name of the DNS server and its IP address. So, an example zone file could include: 

It might be an issue, but that would not be the only issue. Even without swapping, applications might write temporary files to disk, not being aware that the original file was stored in some secure way. Like a word processor might auto-save your document every now and then. And maybe a video player could auto-convert files that are not using its native format, and write that temporary file to disk as well. Also, all programs will have (part of) the file in their own memory, which might be written to disk upon hibernation (sleep). 

I feel this would be fine to refer to Heading 1 if that heading always starts on a new page (in which case I'm sure you don't want the previous Heading 1 to show on top). It also seems to adhere to your "If the page has Section 1.2.1 in it, then the header should say ". But I'd expect to also show if it started on a previous page and was still continuing on top of the current page. For that, with , you'd get if that starts somewhere on the current page; just like you asked for, but it might be confusing. Also, things might be really wrong if some Heading 1 is found on the current page, but its child Heading 2 is not, in which case Word tries to find a Heading 2 on previous pages. And if parts do not use all levels of headings, then headings from different parts might be found and be combined in the breadcrumb, and Word might even be looking forward to find a match. Consider these bad results: 

If all else fails, then using a packet analyzer (network sniffer) like Wireshark will show passwords if these are not encrypted. Just be sure to filter on , or ensure no other applications are running that flood the logs. 

There's only a very small chance you can. Just running X is not enough; it also needs to have been configured to allow remote login (such as XDMCP). And any firewall or router needs to have the ports configured well (TCP 6000-6005 for X11, UDP 177 for XDMCP, and optionally TCP 7100 for the xfs font server), for otherwise it will only work using after all. A sane administrator would probably only allow access through SSH anyway. But, you could try Xephyr (or the older Xnest, or XWin.exe in Cygwin), using something like: 

Sounds like this is not an Apache issue, but like your is using HTML frames. So, to get rid of this behavior, you'll have to get rid of the frames. Update, as this is your DNS provider adding those frames: If you have a fixed public IP address, then any normal DNS provider allows you to map your domain to some specific IP address, instead of using some magical frameset. Your DNS provider seems to offer this as well. 

Beware though when using when using multiple windows. This will print the wrong results when switching to another tab in 5 seconds: 

Only if you need to access the files quite often, and only recommended after the procedures using Cyberduck or Transmit have been successful (to ensure your credentials and all are fine): Mount the resources locally using SSHFS with FUSE for OS X (formerly packaged in MacFUSE, but that does not support 10.6 and up). 

It can be done, but only with a router that supports Sleep Proxy Service, or with Snow Leopard and a recent Apple router. So, I guess you're out of luck. From Apple's Mac OS X v10.6: About Wake on Demand: 

When looking for a specific character or block at FileFormat.info, one can see which fonts are known to support it. This took me to the Code2000 font. It's $5 shareware, which seems very reasonable: 

See also Introduction to Scripting Mail at MacTech, and some examples of find and replace at MacScripter. DISCLAIMER: none of the above has been tested a lot! 

Holding down Option while clicking the Time Machine icon, will change "Enter Time Machine" into "Browse Other Time Machine Disks". I guess that makes it easier to restore just the documents you need, after a clean install of Leopard (without any migration during the installation). 

(As a side note: some laser printers are known to count colour usage even when printing in black and white.) 

If there's at most one character there, then for the value in , the following formula will do the trick: 

(For changing EXIF data through command line tools see the "APP1" profile in, for example, ImageMagick. ImageMagick also supports auto-orient.) 

Given the fact that Firefox allows for using different profiles, each with their own extensions, I never thought that it would use the registry as well. (Firefox being cross-platform makes me even wonder more about that, especially as Firefox already has it own kind of cross-platform mechanism of storing settings.) So unless you're sure it's in the registry, you might want to peek into the Files and folders in the profile, especially . UPDATE The file is automatically generated by nsExtensionManager and is used by low-level code to detect chrome packages and XPCOM components provided by installed addons. Can be deleted to resolve various issues.
