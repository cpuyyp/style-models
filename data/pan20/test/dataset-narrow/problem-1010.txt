Here is a file I have $URL$ It's a text file about 1.18MB in size Looking at how many matching lines I get With -P 

So I can only see those workarounds to the old DOS append command. pushd popd, or doskey macros. or a batch file. or 2 cmd windows one in one directory one in another. Or specifying the full path of the data file. Or writing a bat file python.bat or mypython.bat that tries each directory to see if the file is there and runs it where it exists! 

I'm a bit rusty on virtualbox. I have a VM with this setup You see an icon to access the Host machine, and the C drive available. 

Try unchecking the box that says "use master password and keyfile" and clicking cancel, or just click cancel. You can then do file..new and create a new database file with a password, or do file..open and open an existing one. Also, a key file is optional. It's possible to have a master password without specifying/having a key file. 

You really should correct your question particularly when I pointed out the error in it, you left it there with the error. I have actually once implemented what you speak of, in two different ways, with only one port open, VNCing to any computer behind the network. Method 1- SSH to the NAT router which forwards to one machine, but specify in the ssh command with -L, which machine to forward to, and then VNC through it. Method 2- VPN, then VNC to whichever computer Method 2 is much easier. Look up videos or article on how to do a VPN in Windows [or Linux]. You need one port forward too. 

I have internet access but the icon in the taskbar seems wrong. Here is a screenshot of the situation 

The first element in the chrome history is a checkbox whose id is checkbox-0 But I can't see it from the console. I can't see any checkboxes from the console. 

I haven't tried this much, but this might help. It's a SATA-IDE connector, but i think it goes 2 ways. SATA->IDE and IDE->SATA, I don't know if one ever needs a gender changer for this. The power connector on it is not to power the drive, it's to power the circuitry on the board. You may need a 2.5"-3.5" cable WITH a gender changer, as 2.5-3.5" cables that i've seen are female both end and you need the end of the cable that goes into the laptop motherboard to be male. Also you'd be plugging the 3.5" end into an adapter and then from there using a sata cable to a hard drive. That is different to the normal usage where the 3.5" goes to a MBRD, and the 2.5" to a drive. In this context, I'm not sure if you also have to be careful with which side is pin1 and whether pin1 is pin1 on both ends. (A good technical review of a 2.5" both sides cable in the other answer suggests the red stripe denoting pin1 might only apply to one end, but i'm not sure if that particular point is correct). 

3.5" when one says 3.5" drive, does not refer to the size of the drive. It refers to the so-called 3.5" Bay, so-called because it took a floppy disk drive that had a 3.5" disk! Diskette dimensions. The drive we identify as 3.5" but that comes from how we identify the bay which is historical based on the disks the drives in that bay took. 2.5" drives are called 2.5" drives because 2.5" is the diameter of the platter of the drive, I've heard. BTW, the 5.25" bay, like the 3.5" bay, is named for the size of the diskette of the disk drive that occupied that bay. Now it's mainly used for DVD/CD Drives. 1.8" might be platter too, $URL$ Also what size to get.. If it's not a laptop, then it's 3.5". And you should really have opened up your desktop and seen the place it'd go and recognise it. If it's a laptop then check properly, 'cos there's 2.5" 12mm was old, 2.5" 9MM is common.. or was last time I checked. And some perhaps smaller ones use 1.8".. So a good idea to check the dimensions of the one in there. And then you'll know what size to get. (added- as of writing, they make 7mm laptop drives) 

Your question seems to assume that each frame is transmitted one after the other, synchronously like one frame, then a gap then another, and thus why a need for a preamble. As if a preamble tells it and just tells it that there's a frame coming. And if a preamble, then why can't it be asynchronous. It is a good question. The preamble isn't for that. Or in fact to put it another way. It is actually asynchronous in the sense that you mean. The answer, is that the preamble isn't for synchronization of one frame followed by another e.t.c. synchronously. There is indeed no such synchronization for that. Frames do not arrive synchronously. It is purely for each individual frame so the electronics, a clock I suppose, reading it, knows when each bit is going to come -for that frame- by the time the processing of that frame reaches the start of the SFD(start of frame delimiter). Once the frame has been completely read, it has no idea when the next frame will arrive. In fact it never has any idea when the next frame will arrive. Below are some quotes from some documents which serve as sources by which I can answer your question. 

I googled about motorola modem firewall.. Try to configure or disable the firewall. If it does NAPT then should still have NAPT there as a protection. If not then if you have another NAPT device you'll have NAPT as protection! (with your OS software firewall and if you have another hardware firewall then you'll have that) Those inbound attacks would be blocked at that device, by NAPT anyway even without a firewall. (where there's no port forwarding on the ports they attack) There is a user guide for your device here $URL$ Perhaps also see if you can telnet or ssh to it and use iptables and configure it that way. one person here mentions iptables and a similar model number device (apparently comcast is apparently ISP that bought motorola modems and use them and this link mentions iptables in the context of an SB6141, though it's not clear from that whether it does use it) $URL$ If it does use iptables then run the command and see if you see any rules there that might be a culprit. Further, this post $URL$ "Under the firewall settings, by default the only thing checked was IP flood detection and firewall protection. I unchecked both." You could experiment with checking one and not the other. It is accessed by local ip of 192.168.0.1 and does DHCP, and even has a firewall, so i'm confidently assuming that if you do ipconfig it'll show you gateway of 192.168.0.1 or whatever the local ip is, so clearly does NAT. So disabling the firewall should be ok. That link above concurs. $URL$ 

To the obvious question of what to do about it. I got a different error trying to install Yahoo instant messenger v10 on one of my computers. I tried one suggested thing, reinstalling the windows installer was what was suggested for the error I got, but no luck. I tried an earlier version, was fine. If you're willing to then you could try v9 or earlier, it's available on filehippo.com $URL$ maybe in the near future there'll be a new version of v10 or there'll be v11, that'll work for you 

produces a duration of 8s 383ms That is so wrong though 'cos it should be 6 seconds! So that is two seconds too long! 

I am running assoc from an administrative command prompt I'd like to add an entry for .vbsc in my list of associations. It won't let me, Though it will let me do one for .vbsd And it is running assoc. (if it wasn't finding assoc it'd say it's not recognized). So what's going on? I do have a program(a wrapper for cscript.exe) that I wrote that I have linked to .vbsc files, it does attach, though as you see from the grep, it doesn't get listed listed in assoc for some reason, which is an oddity, but the oddity i'm asking about here(which may be related), is why does on my machine say "The system cannot find the file specified"? 

Regarding choosing the font/styles, here is how I did it, with screenshots included. In the bottom left of the find/replace screen choose format..font 

among perhaps other problems. And if you look at suspectus's one, it fails even near the beginning, it breaks on the space 

In Win XP, is it possible to change permissions on a network share, and not require a restart? I don't mean, a case where one doesn't need a restart, though if there are cases where one does and cases where one doesn't , then that's interesting to know which.. But i'd rather a way where whatever the change in permissions, no restart is necessary. 

I think I may have seen this problem of being able to access some websites and not others, (when the websites you can't access are up / up for others), and IIRC I think it may have been an MTU issue and that could be set on the router. Try different values 1492, 1400 1500 try lower values maybe. OP found this link and that it was useful $URL$
