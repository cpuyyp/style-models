Our company just migrated to Windows 7 and decided to use the included "balanced" power plan. The main problem with this is that I use powershell to do remote management and sleeping machines don't respond to these commands. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can send out a signal to wake up only sleeping machines? Now, I already know that I can use the "Magic Packet" with wake on LAN, but that has a few problems. 

[Background] We have been having trouble with our network clients suddenly being unable to print. They get an odd error with a hex code. We determined that something in the driver was messed up and we could resolve the issue by clearing the driver cache and reinstalling the driver. This happens to random computers every so often. We're assuming this is a bug with the latest Dell 2330dn driver since that is the only model that has this problem. [Problem] What we are looking to do is write a Powershell script that would clear the driver cache and redownload the driver. I see a ton of scripts out there to manage queues, servers, and ports, but nothing for local driver cache management. [Current Workaround] Since we have to do this manually, I'll write out the steps so you know what we want this script to replicate. 

I've exhausted all my options apart from switching to KVM ... or slaughtering more roosters. Any suggestions? 

The evidence you have provided suggests that the 405's occur when a PUT request is directed to the default request handler. (The PUT behavior is different for the PHP handler.) The default handler is checking the request method before it checks whether the resource exists and has the correct permissions. Since the default handler doesn't support PUT unless this is enabled, you are seeing 405's rather than 404's. The PUT method is typically enabled by listing it in the config. 

We've got a CentOS server running a cluster of virtuals. Occasionally the cluster's internal network drops out for a minute or so ... and then comes back. The problem is somehow related to the actual network traffic, but it is not a simple load issue. (The system is generally lightly loaded, and the problem occurs irrespective of actual load.) The setup: 

The system has one externally visible IP address, and Dom0 runs an Apache httpd configured with a number of virtual hosts each of which reverse proxies to web servers running on the virtuals. (The virtuals have to be NAT'ed, primarily because we don't have enough allocated public IP addresses.) The symptoms: 

So I am trying to get Remote Installation Service Running on a Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 installed. I am trying to integrate network drivers into the image and I keep getting this warning in the event log. 

Who is going to be managing this service? Who is going to install new objects to this service? (ie: New printers or drivers) How difficult is it to restart the harware/VM in the event of a major problem? Does the system have enough resources to manage the load? What other services does this hardware provide? Any mission critical? How critical is print services? 

I am running into an interesting issue with some applications not evaluating properly in SCCM 2012. The example software I have is Adobe reader 11. When I install using an MSI deployment through software center, everything works great. The problem comes up when someone goes to the adobe website and downloads the executable installer and runs that. Now software center detects the software as uninstalled and will list is as an available title. I am using the "Windows installer" detection method and looking for this GUID "{AC76BA86-7AD7-1033-7B44-AB0000000001}". When I look in the AppDiscovery.log, all I get is an "+++ Application not discovered." message. So here's the question: Where can I see what the detection method is querying and what it gets back? Bonus Question: When performing a "Windows Installer" detection, where does the system look for that GUID? Thanks in advance 

I have a Chef Node that I'm initially setting up on one network that I need to (physically) move to another network. When this happens, I want the IP address and domain name to change, and the Node name and simple hostname to stay the same. I know I can do this by deleting the Chef Node and recreating it. Could I also do it by editing Node attributes? Or would that break the client keys or (worse still) the server? (I'm using Chef 10.16.2 ...) 

I've got that much working. But the last thing I want to be able to do is to disable login on the account by locally locking the password (e.g. using ). The problem is that when the local password is locked, PAM is falling back to Kerberos ... and allowing access. Is there a way to configure PAM so that if a local password exists but it is locked that it won't try Kerberos? The best I can think of so far is to lock the account by clobbering the local password with something unguessable. But that is a bit crude, and doesn't play well if someone does not "follow the procedure" ... 

From what little I know about WMI, this is created by the SCCM client, which makes a twisted kind of sense when you think about how SCCM works. I got this location from the "Deployment Monitoring Tool" that you can get in the System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Toolkit. If you look in the deployments area and the Enforcement tab, you can look at the DiscoverySourceXML to see what the detection returned. I just found this out today so I haven't been able to fully test it yet. This location could be just the results store for the application discovery process. So far, it's good enough to let me know what product codes work with the SCCM application evaluation process. I really need an SCCM developer to see this and set me straight. 

At our organization, we have multiple levels of support personnel. The lowest (level 1) of these personnel deal with a single job site with about 40 printers. Each site has a Windows Server 2003 R2 machine that provides file and print permissions. These lower level support personnel do not have admin rights to this server and they never will. This is a problem because when a new printer is delivered, the company wide techs (level 2) must add the printer to the server. So my question is this: Is there a way to allow non-admins to add printers to a Windows Server machine? These users shouldn't be able to add drivers or make system wide changes. They just need to be able to add, delete, and configure printer objects and printer ports. The per printer item security permission "manage printer" don't allow the user to modify the port. Anyone have any ideas on what we can do? We need to at least let the user rename the port if possible. Thanks in advance [EDIT] These servers are not Domain controllers, but actually member servers. It apparently makes a difference. 

I'm trying to fix a problem in a Chef recipe for installing / configuring ClamAV which is caused by the recipe using the wrong default user/group name for the clam service account on some platforms. It seems that: 

I'm trying to set up Chef-managed accounts for a group of machines with the following characteristics: 

Have I over-simplified this? Does anyone know of any examples that contradict this? (Lets assume that we are talking about the "recommended" RPMs / DEBs for the respective platforms ...) 

I need to check this at work, but I think I could add a "pam_exec" entry to the stack after "pam_krb5" entry. This could run a script that uses "passwd -S" to check that the password entry for the user has not been locked. Or I could do it by placing the user a "blocked" group and using pam_succeed_if like this: 

I have a use-case where a chef recipe needs to use 'remote_file' to fetch a file on a virtual, and the fetch needs to be do through an HTTP proxy. This is not working because chef-client doesn't use the system proxy settings ... it gets its proxy settings from the So how do I get proxy settings (or settings in general) into the file on a client? Ideally, I'd like it to happen at client bootstrap time, but I can't see how to do that short of hacking the code. The other possibility is that I could create a recipe that updates the file. But that strikes me as a bit dangerous. And it means that you need to run chef-client twice before it works, assuming that the missing proxy setting in the first run causes the run to ultimately fail. Any ideas on how to fix this? 

So far, no luck on the fonts. I have to have a "silent installer" for these fonts so I can push it out to the 100+ machines this needs to go on. Thanks in advance 

Disable print spooler Restart machine Delete contents of: C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86 Enable print spooler and start service. Delete the network printer object and re-add network printer off of server. 

We've begun our migration to windows 7 and we ran into an interesting issue. When we hit "CTRL+ALT+DEL" we are brought to the "User selection Screen". Normally, this screen will have an icon for every local user for the machine. These machines are Domain members with "Fast User Switch" disabled so no user names are listed only the "Other User" option. If you click "Other User" or hit enter, the system moves on to the normal login screen where it prompts for user name and password. Here's the issue: We want to find a way to skip over the part where a user selects "Other User". We essentially want the system to always assume that we always want "Other User" and to go directly to the login screen when a user hits "CTRL+ALT+DEL". What I find odd is that the "Other User" doesn't show up until we've had more than one domain user log in. Right after we re-image the machine, the login process goes directly to the user credential prompt. [EDIT] Security Policies set by Active Directory:
