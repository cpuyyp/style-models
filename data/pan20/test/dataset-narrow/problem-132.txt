what's the likely difference between the two offerings? when is 150Mbps not equal to 150Mbps? i.e. is there likely to be a real difference in the end user experience with vendor A's 150Mbps vs. vendor B's 150Mbps? If so, why? what questions would you be asking these vendors if you were in the market to buy new bandwidth? 

First of all, I am new to the forum and am unsure whether this is the right place to post my question. If this is not the right place, I would appreciate you letting me know the best website to ask this question. I am a business person seeking the advice of those who know way more about this stuff than I ever will. I am grateful for any assistance you can provide. I'm starting a startup accelerator and trying to spec and purchase sufficient bandwidth for a new facility. I have quotes from two different providers at different levels of bandwidth but the prices are wildly different. For example, one is providing 150Mbps bandwidth for $1100/Mo. The other is providing 150Mbps for $250/mo. There must be some profound reason why one is 4x the price. I'm talking to each of the company representatives and asking them directly about this disparity, but - given that these people are selling - it would be useful to know from an independent source.: 

I'm trying to understand the mechanism by which bandwidth is consumed so that I can set the appropriate QoS and/or priority policies on the firewall. Here's the scenario: Our setup is a Fortigate 60E that sits between our LAN and an AT&T Managed Router with a 10Mbps connection. When there is no one inside our facility but me, I initiate a single request from my PC browser to a site that starts the download of a 180Mb file. I can watch the bandwidth usage graph for the internal and external interfaces immediately jump to 10Mbps (i.e. the full limit of our service) and, when the download completes, the throughput graph drops back down to 0. Before the download completes, I initiate another browser request (pick your typical news site with images and text), the firewall graph of bandwidth usage stays at 10Mbps and my second request ultimately gets served. My question is this: what determines how much bandwidth is allocated to my second browser request? Furthermore, since the default priority (according to Fortigate) is that all requests have a default priority of "high" how are "competing requests" resolved? Clearly it's not sequential (first come, first served) because the second request is fulfilled before the first request (download) is completed. When there are 10 or 15 people in the office, this scenario will be repeated and amplified many times over. I don't have VOIP or email or an ecommerce server that I need to elevate or prioritize over "normal" internet use. I just have a bunch of people accessing the web simultaneously and they have an expectation of a reasonably responsive internet. So I want to prevent the first requestor having a super fast awesome experience while everyone else (i.e. the subsequent requestors) waits. My initial thought was to set a maximum bandwidth for all requests (i.e. no request would be allocated more than say 1Mbps of bandwidth), thinking that this would prevent one request from sucking up all the bandwidth. Is this advisable? If so, how would you do it? (Traffic shaping policy? or something else?) Would changing the priority of all traffic to medium (vs. the default high priority) have a favorable effect? Would it be advisable? I'm new to this stuff, our company is new and our IT infrastructure setup is fresh as well. Feel free to let me know if I'm just not thinking about this the right way. I've read a ton but understand less than half of the jargon that gets tossed around. A layman's explanation/response would be most welcomed! 

To answer your first question, Yes someone with a wireless sniffer will be able to find your "hidden" SSID by examining probe requests from clients that are already configured to connect to that SSID. Implementing 802.1x can provide the security you are looking for IF it is configured correctly. At the very least you will want to configure your clients to verify the RADIUS server's TLS certificate and server name to prevent the attack you are concerned about (I believe it's referred to as an "evil-twin" attack). Implementing 802.1x is not easy. It requires setting up, configuring, and maintaining a RADIUS server as well as TLS Certificates. It will require end user education and training. Without understanding more about your infrastructure and risk profile that's the best answer I can give. 

Even then it still might not work. Apple never designed Airplay to work across different subnets. However, it still may be possible to get it to work. Most enterprise wireless vendors have "special" support for Bonjour (or it's official name: Multicast Domain Name Service - MDNS). I believe Ruckus does have support for this, again you will have to consult your documentation. -Neil 

The router (the switch appears to be acting as a router) is not configured to forward multicast traffic between the wired and wireless networks. If you enable multicast, be sure to enable igmp snooping on the switch as well, or you will be flooding the multicast traffic out all of the wired switch ports in that network. A lot of enterprise wireless Access Points are configured by default to not transmit multicast traffic out to the air because it can consume valuable airtime and degrade the performance of the wireless network. It is possible to enable multicast if needed, but be aware multicast traffic is transmitted at the lowest data rate the wireless network is configured to support. Some enterprise AP's can be configured to optimize Multicast traffic by converting it to Unicast, check your documentation. 

A Passive Optical Network (PON) is used by a lot of Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Internet Service Providers (ISP) to provide network access over a single fiber to multiple end points (homes). Here is a link to the Wikipedia Page on PON's. 

LAN2 (source:192.168.2.100, destination:192.168.102.100) ------> LAN2 Gateway Router which will do NATing and VPN. (change source:192.168.202.100,destination:192.168.102.100) --------------> LAN1 Gateway Router which will terminate VPN and do NATing (source:192.168.202.100,change destination:192.168.2.100) -----------------------------------------------------> Packet reaches LAN1. 

As you can see, LAN1 appears to LAN2 as 192.168.102.0/24 and LAN2 appears to LAN1 as 192.168.202.0/24. 

There is an option to resolve IP conflicts between clients on Cisco IOS. It needs to be configured carefully. from this source: 

ARP tables are populated when the machine sends any traffic to the network (DHCP or any other). The switch receives the packets generated by the machine and grabs the mac address of the machine and puts in ARP table with the information of the port it came from. So, if you can't see the ARP entry of the laptop, it means that the laptop did not exchange any packets with switch. A note, there are two commands for arp: and . 

You will need double NATing to achieve this without changing IP addresses. You can not ping an IP that is in your LAN and expect it to reach somewhere else. As long as you are part of a LAN and communicate locally, your traffic to IP address in 192.168.2.0/24 will always go to your local network. As mentioned above, you will need two IP ranges lets say 192.168.102.0/24 and 192.168.202 that will be used for double NATing like this: 

LAN1 (source:192.168.2.100, destination:192.168.202.100) -------> LAN1 Gateway Router which will do NATing and VPN. (change source:192.168.102.100,destination:192.168.202.100) ---------------> LAN2 Gateway Router which will terminate VPN and do NATing (source:192.168.102.100,change destination:192.168.2.100) ------------------------------------------------------> Packet reaches LAN2. 

If you have the conflict resolution configuration in place, the device will chack if the IP address is already assigned to another client or not. Also, If the clients are already assigned an IP and the DHCP for some reason stops, the client will continue to communicate normally before the renew period expires. So in case you reconfiguration affects the DHCP, you clients that already have an IP will not be affected. The new ones will get the IP from the new pool after the conflict test is passed. However, if your setup is critical, I strongly advise you to do a test of this scenarion on a spare router before implementing it on a live system. Also try to find a low traffic period for your change.
