Postfix server M (Stores mail) Postfix Server A (Relays mail using internet connection IA) Postfix Server B (Relays mail using internet connection IB) Internal DNS Server (does local name resolution) 

My question aims to clarify whether I can get a setup running, where Server A on 1 site receives email as is received at the same time by Server B on site two. The requirement is to have Server B be failed to in case Server A is inaccessible, or down; but at any given moment, users will be using one of the two. The setup I know is that one server can temporarily receive email for the other whilst its done, but then forward, using two or three MX records with differing priorities e.g. MX 10 mail.example.com MX 20 mail.example.com but how do you make it that each and every email is sent to both servers, and one server is used as sending server by users? Take note, this is platform open, meaning I would also allow answers suggesting platforms, but so far these are my platforms 

All these can be factors, you just need to ask yourself question 1 above, or understand the ssh configuration made on that PC to see if its not one of the factors I mentionedfor question 2 and 3. Good Luck. 

for me above, this means FIND A USER, WHERE %n is the same as sAMAccountName. (%n in ldap configurations means username before @ sign in email, %u means full email address, %d means domain). This is searched in the LDAP database, which looks something like this, and so you can replace the part with some other UNIQUE attribute, like , which mean the mail attribute in the LDAP database must match the FULL ENTRY entered by the user on login. More can be understood by intensely looking at this: $URL$ record 54 dn: CN=Gift Rise,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=co,DC=za cn: Gift Rise sn: grise ... sAMAccountName: grise sAMAccountType: 805306368 

I want users to login to my mail server using: u: user1 (NOT user1@example.com) p: password I am using Samba4 on Zentyal for authentication. How can I configure such that users do not have to add the domain name as username when logging in? 

Is it in a LAN, or publicly (internet) visible. If in a LAN, you can't connect to that machine when you are at home because the machine is in a different LAN, unless you get a link to the public domain. Is ssh enabled for the user e.g. root (or the one you connecting with) in the ssh config file of the machine you want to connect to (you did not specify the OS on the 'school computer': if its Linux then follow the guide to "refuse remote ssh for root" on google? Lastly, is ssh disabled outside the LAN. 

you can remove i386 directory with the caveat that if you need to install new services you need the windows cd handy, or if corrupt files or if you install new hardware. it's not critical to the operation of windows itself. 

I'm trying to migrate a dns server that has several thousand zones loaded on it. The named.conf file has about 17 different includes, and some of those files also has includes in them, and lots of commented out etc. It's a fricking mess! I'm wanting to get a list of all the zones currently loaded into BIND. I looked at rndc dumpdb but it doesn't show me just the zones. Instead of following the messy include files, is there an easier way to get a list of the authorative zones inside BIND? Thanks! 

I'd likely blame power management settings on the NIC. Replacing the NIC with something non sucky (intel?) is good way to confirm. Sounds like network link is dropping. Verify that within event viewer on the pc. Should show something like "Network Link down". If you confirm it's not a network card issue (most likely), then the next likely suspect is a dhcp lease timeout/dhcp server problems. Again, that will be listed in event viewer on local pc. If in doubt, assign a static ip and see if disappears. 

Unfortunately that's a bit vague to start with. Define "performance drops a lot". This is one of those situation wheres there's about 20 different things to check, both hardware and software. Hardware: - do you have a good decent nic on both ends? (intel/broadcom), not realtek - do you have a managed switch? - Is the managed switch maybe unavailable to do all the process switching if small packets? - have you tried swapping network cables - confirmed it's gigabit? - perhaps your harddisks can't keep up with the data streams? generic basic harddrives can be maxed out on gigabit. - do have a network card that does TOE? Software: - are you using mtu 9000 aka jumbo buffers in card? - have you looked at tuning receive windows or buffers? - What OS? - If windows, do you have av/firewall software running? Applicationlevel/Data: - is it being encrypted? (tunneled over ssh?) - What protocol? ftp/cifs/rsync/http/nfs - what are the size of files? thousands of small files or one really large one? There's so many places to start, but those are some questions you need to answer to yourself. Once you get to the software level, I would recommend using iperf between the 2 machines and seeing what the maximum of raw data you get. That will tell you the highest possible speeds. Then you can compare it to what your application is giving you. 

Server M, A and B reside in a same network LAN, that means even when the internet connections IA and IB drop, the communication between M & A and M & B won't necessarily drop, so I can't use Postfix's smtp_fallback_relay option for this. Now, I need server M to submit only to the server that will have internet connection at the time of relaying to it. How can we do this best? What we tried My colleague and I shared two alternatives (Not exhaustive): 

I work an 8am-5pm job in a server room partition, separated by closed glass from the actual room where the server racks are mounted, from where the continual buzz sound of running servers, approximately 12 -15 of various sizes (mostly mini computers or small business servers, no main frames), is audible all shift long. Recently, my co workers have been complaining about the static charge i discharge onto them when i greet or exchange pleasantries physically with them, mostly as soon as i leave the room for up to something like 5 minutes. It doesn't always happen when i have touched any of the servers, sometimes its just being in the presence of the room i work in that gets me charged up. Where i sit, the temperature ranges from 18 to 30 degrees Celcius, depending on whether i have my air conditioner on. There are two issues that now make me think of their harm: 1. The buzz sound & 2. The static electricity Can this be cancerous? And are there any ways this can harm me if i continually manage servers in such an environment? What best practices can i take to ensure the safety of both the servers and myself? 

Update IN WHAT WAY (preferably using Zentyal setup above) can I setup Server B to get the same email that Server A gets (even by forwards, or whatever TRICK): if this is possible, or can be achieved, and in what way. I have researched and can't find clarity on this matter if this is a STANDARD or you have to achieve it by the TRICK. What I want is whether its possible, if not WHY. ULTIMATELY, the feel should be that when Server A is down, Server B is connected to by both users sending email, and for receiving email into the mail store (Which can be explained if it is one or more, however ONE still leaves the problem of a failure with that mail store), and users connect to it for IMAP and POP3 

Not sure if I understand the question but you wont be able to have high availabilty of your virtual machines running on a host system. If you're already running an OS, then you need to add on a virtual machine service to windows. this would include: - virtualbox (free) - vmware server (free but being discontinued) - vmware player (free) - vmware workstation (paid) You can run VMs on each desktop, however you WILL notice a slowdown of the host system even if the VM isnt doing anything. CPU is only one concern - HD activity, network activity, ram, and most endusers will notice if you "sneak" a vm onto their workstation. If you're looking for high availability - to move vm around from machine to machine seamlessly - you're looking at commercial software from vmare/xen/microsoft. Using existing workstations is a bad idea as it will be slow and hassle to admin. What you're asking about isnt done in the real world. If you're wanting to play sure go for it, but if this is for a business/school/nonpersonal network it's bad idea to try to harness the "spare" cpu power, cannot stress that enough. It doesnt scale. 

Confirmed rndc dumpdb is the best method. In my case, i discovered that there was 2 seperate bind instances running on the same server (don't ask), one doing forward dns and one doing reverse dns. Without specifying the PID, it attached to the one only doing reverse dns and only showed me that. 

So... was trying to add in a 2008 DC to a single 2003/exchange 2007 setup. ran adprep and updated schema, and joined the new DC to the AD... then 6 hours later noticed everything was not working. Restore tapes are offsite and not available for a few days so no easy option. The gist is the GC is not locatable and the sysvol isn't being shared. If you connect directly to the DC you can query all objects inside the AD properly, but nothing that queries the root domain itself works. went through the dns tree and eveyrthing seems proper. the server is pointing to itself for dns. dcdiag shows: Starting test: FsmoCheck Warning: DcGetDcName(GC_SERVER_REQUIRED) call failed, error 1355 A Global Catalog Server could not be located - All GC's are down. Warning: DcGetDcName(TIME_SERVER) call failed, error 1355 A Time Server could not be located. The server holding the PDC role is down. Warning: DcGetDcName(GOOD_TIME_SERVER_PREFERRED) call failed, error 1355 A Good Time Server could not be located. Warning: DcGetDcName(KDC_REQUIRED) call failed, error 1355 A KDC could not be located - All the KDCs are down. i have done ntdsutil and seized all roles anyway, confirmed under sites that the DC is a GC. it should work...google doesnt show what i want.... i'm good with AD but not good enough ;) Where do i go from here?
