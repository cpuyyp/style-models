I am in the process of deploying a production environment for a website, It runs on AWS. This includes a private VPC with a load balancer and a single EC2 instance running Debian 8.1 However, in the future there will be more EC2 instances as traffic becomes heavier and the load balancer actually needs to work. Therefore I am currently looking into options to deploy multiple EC2 instances with the same codebase and configuration. It comes down to storage, but I don't think that it is possible to reliably deploy S3 as a home directory for our website. The current EC2 instance also makes use of Syslog and many other security features such as tripwire. The main website runs as a wsgi app under apache and is Python (Django) based. Unfortunately, we will also need to push files that can be downloaded by the users. Is unison a solution or what would be used ? ElasticBeanstalk is not an option. The website itself is deployed using git. 

I imagine that since actual server name and apparent email domain are different, sending mail is somehow considered open relay and actual message goes to void. Anyway, does anyone have an idea, how to fix discrepancies with name or how to fix SMTP server name? TNX! 

I would your suggestions for an effective solution for a person, who needs to access resources in two Windows domains and wants to use one computer. It's about our CEO, who has accepted a second position in another company. Accessing files and folders isn't big problem. The greatest challenge I see is that he wants to conveniently access Exchange accounts in both companies; he would like to send and receive mail in single Outlook if possible (two profiles?) There is also a challenge with calendars: he would like to have one calendar for all activities from both Exchange accounts. Creating a POP3 account for accessing second Exchange server is a last resort, because obviously there is a problem with scheduling meetings and other calendar related tasks. Forwarding and receiving all mail/tasks on primary Exchange server is inconvenient because simple replying to original sender is disabled; and also when manually changing the recepient, he will receive mail from the wrong address. We were considering Virtualisation, that is setting up an instance of virtual machine inside existing installation and then joining this virtual computer to a second domain. Then installing another MS Outlook. This would of course mean two different Outlook accounts, two different calendars, but would at least enable our CEO to access all information from a single laptop. Does anyone have any other idea? I know setting up two domains on a single computer is a no-go (without much hacking at least), but effective workarounds are appreciate. The thing I am looking here is high usage/efficiency/productivity, but also as elegant solution from the administration point of view. Thank you very much (if you managed to read this through, this is a good sign ^_^ ) 

Thats not the default one, however it is in the allowed range. The UDP port range is the default since it is not advised to change them. I tried to change the "networkprofile" from 100mbits/1gbits and custom. I am running a 1gbit network with CAT6 cables and 1gbit netgear switch 5 ports. Everything is configured to use 1gbit. The WDS is authorised for the DHCP server. My ISA 2006 configuration: For the internal networking i have configured the following policy array: Allow protocols on internal network including the w2k3 host: 

The confusing part here is that it is advised in the tab to tick the first option since it is on the same server. Network Configuration Tab: 

SITUATION: A larger company acquires a smaller one. IT infrastructure has to be merged. There are no immediate plans to change the current size or role of the smaller company - the offices and production remain. It has a Win 2003 SBS domain server, Win 2000 file server, linux server for SVN and internal Wikipedia, 2 or 3 production machines, LTO backup solution. The servers are approx. 5 years old. Cisco network equippment (switches, wireless, ASA). Mail solution is a hosted Exchange. There are approx. 35 desktops and laptops in the company. IT infrastructure unification: There are 2 IT merging proposals. 1.) Replacing old servers, installing Win Server 2008 domain controller, and setting up either subdomain or domain trust to a larger company. File server and other servers remain local and synchronization should be set up to a centralized location in larger company. Similary with the backup - it remains local and if needed it should be replicated to a centralized location. Licensing is managed by smaller company. 2.) All servers are moved to a centralized location in larger company. As many desktop machines as possible are replaced by thin clients. The actual machines are virtualized and hosted by Terminal server at the same central location. Citrix solutions will be used. Only router and site-2-site VPN connection remain at the smaller company. Backup internet line to insure near 100% availability is needed. Licensing is mainly managed by larger company. Only specialized software for PCs that will not be virtualized is managed by smaller company. I'd like to ask you to discuss both solutions a bit. In your opinion, which is better from the operational point of view? Which is more reliable, cheaper in the long run? Easier to manage from the system administrator's point of view? Easier on the budget and easier to maintain from IT department's point of view? Does anybody have any experience with the second option and how does it perform in production environment? Pros and cons of both? Your input will be of great significance to me. Thank you very much! 

So basically the script checks in the beginning if the variable is set, if it is not set than it must be new visitor, therefore it should redirect to the homepage. If that is actually set then it should not redirect. EDIT: Recognised, my first solution was wrong since it could not match if he actually came from a subpage. 

Its a USB drive? Have you tried to safely remove it and unplug it and restart the computer? Then reconnect it and try to share it again? Sometimes these little things help on windows. You could also try the advance sharing rather than the normal sharing - or the other way around. Put the permissions on groups rather than on single users. Thats what I would try first. 

Following an acquisition we are switching from our local Exchange to an outside provider. I need to change account settings / create new profile so that users are able to access their new mailbox, and I hate the idea of doing it manually on every single client. I have tried quick and dirty solution with copying profile information from Registry on one computer to the other, hoping that I could fix user info later. Quite obviously, this didn't work: Outlook recognized the profile, I could select it at the application startup, but there the fun ends - the profile was corrupt. I couldn't change settings in Mail settings on Control panel, either. Didn't find any Group policy solution. Is there any application, script or other solution, that would help me save time commuting from one PC to the other and typing the same info over and over again? 

I have been struggling with a problem on my Windows Server 2008 for the past 4 - 5 hours and cannot figure out whats wrong. I have tried pretty much everything that I found on google and all the links are purple. Hopefully you guys can help me. I am running a Windows Server 2008 Standard edition with the latest updates as of today. Furthermore I am running a Windows Server 2003. Both are virtual machines on my ESXi 5 server. My network is: 192.168.10.0/24 W2k8: 192.168.10.251 is the PDC running ADS, DHCP and WDS W2k3: 192.168.10.253 AND 192.168.1.175 running Routing and Remote Access and ISA 2006 Enterprise In my internal network (192.168.10.0/24) I have my client machine (192.168.10.10) that runs a VMWare Workstation. I am trying to deploy Windows 7 Home Premium to a virtual machine on my VMWorkstation via PXE. I have set the Workstation's VM network adapter to "bridged" so that it uses the physical network adapter and is connected to my internal network. The DHCP pool is configured to give IP addresses from 192.168.10.10-192.168.10.15 (works for normal clients and is not used up) When I start my VM with the PXE I get the error: PXE-E52:proxyDHCP offers were received. No DHCP offers were received Apperently this means "that means that WDS responded but the DHCP server did not." People suggested to direct the traffic to both WDS and DHCP on the router, since everything is on the same subnet there is no need for that as the broadcast is seen by everyone (WDS and DHCP) No reservation for the virtual mac addrs is made on the DHCP. Furthermore it was suggested to configure the DHCP options: 

I also wanted to be sure that default user profiles won't get overwritten, so I changed corresponding settings to match: 

Further comments: The larger company is planning to implement seconnd solution internally for accountants and other "office" PCs. The infrastructure isn't there yet, but people with experience in this area will work on it. The smaller company would then also have about a third of its computers virtualized and put up on terminal server. 

I have a user in a domain who has access to multiple subfolders in multiple folders. His rights were defined pretty granularly. Now he's leaving the company but will continue to work for a firm as a contracted resource. I need to find all folders he had access to and revoke his permissions, then set him up with a different set of access permissions. Is there any tool (freeware, preferably) that lists all NTFS permissions for a given user? I've tried with AccessEnum from Sysinternals, but the list cannot be filtered by username and is useless for me. I've looked at CACLS, too, but as far as I can tell it displays permissions ordered by file, not by user. Any ideas? 

However, this is not recommended by Microsoft, I tried it and it did not solve my problem. The configuration on the WDS (My System is German therefore the actual naming might be different): PXE response tab: 

I am currently building a storage unit for our office. It is rather low budget at the moment, but it needs to be extendable. basically we have a huge database that will grow over the next few months quite heavily. Therefore, ideally we would just like to throw hard discs at our new server. We have not purchased the server yet, but going through some details. However, I would like to get an answer to a question first. How easy is it to expand existing RAID systems? We will start with two HDD 4TBs WD black. But after about 1 month we will need to add another 2 4TB disks. The server we are going to get has 12 bays. Mirroring is important, However RAID 1 only works with 2 disks. Raid 10, would already allow us to mirror a RAID 0. And from what I have seen even the raid 10 can be installed with two disks. However, what happens after that ? Is there any recommendation to achieve a flexible RAID system ? On the OS layer I would just like to build a LVM, that recognises once there is space added to the "disk" so that it can be expanded. But in fact, it lies on several disks which are managed by the RAID controller. 

Well, I found the solution that works perfectly. It uses a simple Logon script, so Avery Payne, one might say you were at least partially right :) Outlook (2003 and later, don't know about earlier versions) allows importing the profile info through PRF file. It is a plain text file, so you can write it from scratch, or preferably - export it from existing profile and edit as needed. I used the second variant. I downloaded Office Resource Kit - I was exporting PRF file from 2003 version, so I downloaded Outlook 2003 version (ORK.EXE, download it here). Installed it and got the Custom Installation Wizard, which enables you to export existing profile to PRF file. Needless to say, you first need to configure a working profile on the PC you're exporting from. After successful export, I edited the PRF file to lose unnecessary stuff and to generalize some settings with Windows variables, so that I get user specific info after the PRF file is imported:
