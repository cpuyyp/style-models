I have a busy celebrity stock photo website and I am trying to hide the photos behind the website root, so they can't be accessed via URL, but my ASP script can read the photo and sends it to he browser in binary. I'm using Windows Server 2008 R2. I would like to know what security settings should be on the folder that contain the photos. My website is sitting at and the photos need to be stored on the D drive here: . I did manage to get this working by simply clicking 'Share' in the properties of and then giving 'Everyone' read/write permissions but I feel I'm doing something wrong. What should I be doing to make this folder safe, but accessible for the server administrator account and my website scripts? What 'Share' properties should I be applying? Should I be sharing? 

We have two versions of PHP on our Linux CentOS6 machine, 5.3.3 and 5.6.7, and wanted to install PHP extensions, memcache and imagick, to 5.6.7. Logged in as root, using yum, we installed both of these, but realised they were only usable in 5.3.3 and not in the latest version. This are the commands we used: 

Working overly tired caused me to use the wrong web.config file in my application, therefore applying a permanent redirect on the wrong URL!! I was meant to convert: 

To solve this you need to extend the session's idle time. You can do this by going to: Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Terminal Services Configuration : Right Click Connection > Sessions Tab And then altering the idle timer settings to suit your needs. I changed mine to have an idle of 1 day before disconnecting and logging out. 

I am trying to build an automated background backup program to backup my entire website and its heavy photo folders, using Amazon's cloud storage service, S3. I am using S3Sync from S3Tools and have successfully tested a dummy backup using only the command line window. When I save the working command line to a batch file (.BAT) and have a Windows schedule call it, it does not work. I can only think this has something to do with the local paths set in the command line. If I go on to my server and open the command prompt from my 'Start' button, the command prompt has a default of: 

We have an Apache 2.2.3 server with OpenSSL 0.9.8e-fips-rhel5. I am running the following SSL configuration in my VirtualHost. I can't find any other config files with any SSL directives whatsoever. 

What can I do to find out why this thing keeps reappearing, and why it's ending up in the root store every time??? 

I tried to reset the session, resetting the user's password, running from a command prompt running under his credentials. Nothing worked. Any ideas? 

I set up a point to site VPN from my computer to my vnet in Azure. Everything connects normally and even on the portal it says the tunnel is established. When connected to the VPN, I am still unable to RDP to my server using its local IP. I verified the proper routes are in place using the route print command. Am I missing an endpoint or something? 

Is it possible to set up a failover site to site VPN tunnel in Azure? I have one tunnel already established to local network "MyLocalNet". I want to set up a second tunnel with a different endpoint but the same local network. Is this possible? If so, can I configure some kind of traffic priority for one tunnel over the other? 

We use SolarWinds SAM software to monitor servers and applications. We started using it to monitor our SQL servers through the performance counters. We started getting alerts two to three times daily saying that the "Total Server Memory" and "User Connections" counters were too high. We get these alerts at the same time for all three servers...almost like it's synchronized to go off at the same time. The alerts reset maybe 3 minutes after going off. I haven't been able to find any reason why this is happening. Any idea what may be causing this, or how to track down the cause? The queries used to pull the data are as follows. For "User Connections": 

Our .co.uk domain isn't used anymore but we still own it. I managed to delete the rule pretty quickly from the config file, as luckily it's in development stages and nobody would have landed on it anyway, and I also deleted the rule from IIS too. However, my browser still gets redirected to the wrong domain but other browsers don't. So I assume everything is OK apart from my browser has cached the rule somehow and somewhere. Have I done any permanent damage to how my site will run in the future and do I need to do anything else to remove this incorrect rule? 

I am trying to migrate an old Windows Server 2003 32-bit machine, running MySQL 4.1, to a new Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit machine, running MySQL 5.1, and have just got to the database part. I have quite a heavy DB sitting on the old server, and before I try to download the tables and then re-upload them to the new site, I want to make sure I don't have to do a conversion first? The old server is not running the latest MySQL or PHP so using PhpMyAdmin is out of the question, and I don't have permsission to change anything like that, I just have a rubbish, basic, buggy WebFusion control panel. Any help gratefully appreciated. 

I have a growing stock photo website. It's currently hosted on a pretty basic dedicated server from WebFusion and I now need to expand, both storage and performance, and to lose their rubbish support team. We have 500k photos online now and reckon we could make the million or two mark quite soon. I'm now stuck on what options there are for expanding, whether to just upgrade the server we have to hold more files, use a third-party storage service, like Amazon, buy our own server or something else. Any suggestions would be amazing, thanks. 

As you can see, the reply seems to be coming from an empty IP (0.0.0.0:67) and so I assume this is the problem. Am I correct? If so, what could be the cause? Thanks! 

Any ideas where to look? I have verified connectivity to the DC and this server has no issues accessing network resources. 

We have Exchange 2010 deployed with Outlook Anywhere. People connect with Outlook to the external hostname (mail.example.com) through RCP/HTTP. It works fine for people outside of the office but when people are inside the office, the Outlook client connects to the NETBIOS name of the server (ex.example.com) and this generates an SSL cert warning since we do not have a cert for the NETBIOS name. How do I resolve this? I assume I need to install a cert for this server which will be trusted by our Windows domain, but I don't know how to do this. Thanks 

Configure AD sites for Site A and Site B. Installed Exchange 2010 SP1 on Windows 2008 R2 machine in Site B. Applied SP2 and SP3. Site A server is configured with mail.domain.com so I configured site B server with mail2.domain.com. Added MX record with lower priority for mail2.domain.com. Ensured that my SPF record contained the mx parameter. Enabled Site B server's receive connectors. Created new send connectors and associated only Site B server to those (in addition to existing ones). Ensured connectivity between the two Exchange servers. Created a mailbox on Site A server, added account to Outlook. Moved mailbox to Site B, continued working with it and ensuring it could send/receive internally/externally. Ensured that outgoing mails were routed through the Site B server and that SPF checks passed. Ran connectivity tests at $URL$ Moved all mailboxes to Site B server and decommissioned Site A server. Changed CAS and Transport URLs back to mail.domain.com and restarted Site B server. 

As the title reads, I'm about to download and install URL Rewrite Go Live extension on my Windows Server 2008 R2 dedicated server, and I need to find out which version of URL Rewrite I should be downloading, x64 or x86. The information that came with the server when I started to rent it said it was 64-bit but when I look at my C: directory I have two Program Files directories, one titled "Program Files" and the other "Program Files (86)" - so this has confused me somewhat. Can anybody suggest how to find this out? 

We tried copying imagick.so and memcache.so from the old extension directory to 5.6.7's extension directory, but without any luck. How do we install these extensions to our latest version, PHP 5.6.7? Or is there a way to resolve this without reinstalling anything? Edit: To install PHP 5.6.7, I used the steps given in this gist: 

I'm fairly new to server administration, so please be gentle with me. On my dedicated server, in IIS6 manager, I've just added a new site called "upload-system", and modified the FTP settings so the home directory is \upload-system\www\uploads\, instead of just \upload-system. This is all okay but have one issue: When I connect to the server using an FTP client, for example CuteFTP, I land in my new home directory, \uploads, just like I wanted, but from there, there's nothing stopping me from going back a directory, using the up-level/back button on the FTP client. I'm actually able to go right back to the c: directory on the server. I created this FTP site so my client can FTP his photos there, I really don't want any of their office staff having access to other parts of the server when connecting via FTP. How do I stop this from happening in IIS6 manager? 

If I already deployed a VM, how can I use the VM agent to install an antivirus software from the Azure marketplace (i.e. McAfee)? There must be some Powershell command or something but everything I've tried hasn't worked. 

I'm running Postfix Sendmail 2.6.6 and my SMTP logs seem to only be going back one month. How can I configure it to retain logs for a longer period of time? BTW I'm referring to logs in \var\logs\maillog* 

Fixed it by forcing it to append a dot '.' as a DNS suffix. Unfortunately this is a hassle to apply on each VM so I'm still waiting for other answers before accepting my own. 

For me what fixed it was to go into the Office 365-linked Azure AD via portal.azure.com, and from there I changed the problematic user's username to the desired one. After that, I went back to Office 365 Admin and again updated the user's login. This time it worked right away. 

I haven't been able to get AWS support on the line and need an answer asap - do the SQL instances on Amazon Web Services RDS use daylight savings? I know the timezone is UTC but not sure if it uses DST.... 

I need to redirect this: $URL$ to this: $URL$ But IIS7 URL rewrite does not recognize the question mark, even if I try to escape it. Is this possible? 

I have an Azure VM with CentOS 7.1, Apache 2.4.6, and MariaDB 5.5. The VM has 2 cores and 3.5 GB RAM. The server is only hosting a small WordPress site with almost no traffic. For the past two days, MariaDB constantly crashes with an OOM error. I've tried so many different things for tweaking performance and so far absolutely nothing has helped. This is the current config from the file:
