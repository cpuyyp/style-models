Is any part of this wrong? I know the partition table by heart, I can find the buggy package within minutes of controlling the device. EDIT: Added caveats! Screen is mostly busted. How quickly can I have it output to an external monitor? I don't have an arch iso handy. Can I chroot from an unrelated live os; say "T.A.I.L.S."? 

The windows 10 anniversary update is out, and I wanted to try out the new bash integration. I used the 'quick setup' to make a root account with no password as the Ubuntu layer has no access to the windows files. I installed the ubuntu layer as a *nix test environment in which to learn to make practical programs and use tools that are more comfortable to use from a command line (mutt, irssi, vim, git). I still have some anxiety about running as root all the time after I accidentally executed as root on my old machine. It would be more convenient to run as root all the time so I don't have to sudo, and there is no risk of making permanent damage to the system as the shell itself has no administrator access to the rest of my system or personal files. Is it acceptable to have root as the only user in this situation? 

Starting this morning, nothing resolved on any connection on any DNS, but nslookup is fine. There seems to be a disconnect between /etc/resolv.conf and all the tools that would use it. I can only access the internet using tor. 

I run a home server with MPD, CUPS, Deluge Seedbox with Web Client (for seeding linux to those who need it), Icecast, and FTP. One thing that's been bothering me when I connect to these services via my web browser, failure to specify the port number leads to a non-response. The solution I've dreamed up is to make a single serving webpage saying 

If you can open heimdall or the compatible equivalent from the shell; you can make a bash script that opens the program, selects a device, file, and options, and opens another shell until 20 counts. Depending on the program and your macro Savvy, you can have new tabs, pipes, or screen sessions to do them all at the same time. unfortunately, I'm not that good, and I have no way to test it, so you would be on your own trying to write that script. EDIT: It would probably be easier on a linux box as device names are as easy as or for hard drives It would probably be easy is C (I don't know C so I can't say for sure) relatively simple in GNU/BourneAgainSHell. The basic rooting process is Download Proper Drivers 

The solution is to configure around the DNS. I set my resolv.conf to PIA's DNS, which resolved the program and allowed me to use NM to handle VPN connections. 

I am running a few un*ces and I have now grasped the power of using different ttys (Ctrl+alt+F(x)). Yesterday, I attached a second monitor. I was able to configure x to extend my desktop, and I became extremely pleased with the setup. Now my ambition leads me to run multiple text terminals simultaneously. Basically, perpendicular to gnu screen. If I have 3 monitors: (left to right) Flatscreen tv laptop 15 inch hp monitor and I want to view SIMULTANEOUSLY /dev/tty5 for irc and Instant message (finch, the ncurses implementation of libpurple /dev/tty1 for bash, browsers, and other /dev/tty4 for music player From left to right. Again, I do not want to use X for this. I want to keep this in mind in the event that I ever switch to entirely text based. The archwiki only has multihead for x. 

You don't need to find a new install disk to modify the file. Get to the raw shell using ctrl alt f1 and sign in as root, or another user. From there, you can access your .bashrc and restore access to the shell. This requires that you set up root or an alternative user before hand. If you have graphical user management available ala Ubuntu Manage Users, you can set up the account immediately. Failing that, use tijko's answer. If all else fails, >install gentoo. 

I am running arch linux. I want to try openbsd without overwriting any machines, and without using a virtual machine (I don't want to use X11. The VirtualBox interface is clunky and I would rather be without it) So my next logical conclusion would be to create a chroot, install openBSD in it, and chroot into it for that openBSD experience, but with linux kernelspace, and so reboot. I am concerned with security so I don't want to perform many operations as root, I don't want to keep about unimportant files. I'm thinking that I would create rsync an openBSD mirror to ~/bsd, compile everything and configure to install to /mnt/openBSD/[whatever] But it feels like I'm forgetting something important. What am I forgetting? 

I run arch Linux on an hp laptop. I installed a graphical login manager (gdm) and during boot, the kernel unpacks, systemd starts, but when it attempts to start my login manager "An error has occurred :(. Log out and try again. [Log out]" But I can't select that button. I know that uninstalling it will repair my system, or at the very least, stop the bleeding. I need to be able to boot into a thumb drive, access my installation and BUT, I am not sure the exact procedure to do so without messing up my system. What partitions do I mount, do I need sudo, do I need to tamper with any init scripts? The laptop is fairly junk, and nothing important is on it, but I don't want to reinstall for a misconfigured package. EDIT: Ok, I have found that with the arch-chroot scripts, I can get into an install by mounting all partitions 

Check if nss-mdns packaged with avahi is having problems reaching the exterior network. Check your /etc/nsswitch.conf for errors. 

The safest way, in my opinion, is to burn a copy of boot-repair-live by yannubuntu. It boots up, you connect to the internet, you reinstall the grub, and in advanced options, choose to install the grub in /dev/sdxy with whichever arguments you may wish. 

Converting a multiple page pdf into png breaks the file into pages. Imagemagick = /usr/bin/convert EDIT: Tested commenter solution on arch linux. Solution 

paste2.org/0MOHzMKN Also, I have successfully booted into arch linux. I used a live cd to chroot in and pacman -R grub ; pacman -Sy grub ; grub-install (args) Problem now? Gentoo and linux mint don't show up on the list. Edit 2: using the 1-2 punch of os-prober and grub-mkconfig from INSIDE arch, I have restored funtionality to Linux mint, and added gentoo onto the list. i now how a full grub menu, that boots into arch and mint, but not gentoo. EDIT 3: $URL$ pacman -R grub pacman -Sy grub grub-install os-prober grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg iI used the help of the bootrepair scripts from yannubuntu. It did all of the configuration necessary to recognize the /boot partition from arch, but not gentoo. The problem is technically solved. I have reached a comfortable state.
