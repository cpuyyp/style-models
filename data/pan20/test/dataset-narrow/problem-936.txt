Firefox 49.0.1 Windows 7 Pro 64bit SP1 I no longer see eBay as a search engine in Firefox and can't seem to add it in or restore it back. It's also missing from another Firefox based browser bundle. 

I was reading an article on Ars Technica the other day where they were lambasting Comcast for being a crappy ISP. Someone came up with a Raspberry Pi that tweets out their speed if it's substantially less than advertised. In the commentary of the article, someone mentioned SmokePing (DSL Reports has an FAQ too). I will be looking into this software, and it sounds like you might want to as well. It looks like it's a cloud service reaching out to your network, but based on the comment, I thought it was something you could set up locally to see outbound metrics. 

I can't scroll up, I can't type, I can't do anything in the window that i would expect to be able to do. I can close the window, but since I can't get this text any other way, I'm forced to scroll line-by-line until I hit the error (separate issue). The command I gave was . I believe I also tried and got similar results. I looked in the PowerShell modules folder, but don't see anything new. 

Ping-Host lets you set a timeout in milliseconds, presumably in an attempt to speed things up. 's timeout is seconds, not milliseconds. It's reeeeeeally slow, even at 1. What got me going Ping_Host wasn't any faster than Test-Connection or Test-NetConnection, so I kept looking. I settled on this script: $URL$ 

I have been running into this problem in Firefox for years. I use SessionManager to be able to recover after I forcibly crash Firefox and restart it, because I haven't found a reliable way to prevent Firefox from gorging on memory. There are plenty of extensions that purport to plug the memory leaks, though they usually only last for so long before Mozilla changes things to break them. Today, while being irate at this issue and looking around SuperUser, I found an article that seemed to have something useful. 20 minutes in, and memory usage has stayed around 500mb, and it was ~3GB before I tried the setting. I did have to crash and restore Firefox though. I think the magic came from one or all of these settings: 

That exclamation mark means there is a problem with DNS. Windows tries to resolve some known DNS names and then if it fails tells you that there is no Internet access. More than likely, there is some config or setting applied to the network and the people you've talked to just don't know about it. You will need to do a lot of things to troubleshoot this: 

I've started to notice a blue selection bar when I mouse over a file in Windows Explorer (aka File Explorer). It's a blue bar that is around the filename, and all of the white space to the right of the file up to the next column. I have configures Explorer to show me list view. I have Classic Explorer installed, but to my knowledge it doesn't have this as a feature. This is a new-to-me feature, and I'd like to turn it off. Searching The Internets, I find plenty of lists of things Windows 10 breaks and how to "fix" Windows 10, but I don't find anyone else complaining about this, nor discussing it. Therefore, I don't know the name of the feature either. How can I turn this off? 

I have a brand new Western Digital MyPassport Studio, which I'd like to use as a utility drive. It will boot my Mac Pro over USB, but not over FireWire 800. Western Digital's support basically told me it's not their problem, although their knowledge base article states that the drive should boot an Intel Mac over FireWire. It's partitioned like so (using GUID): 

I have an iTunes LP that I want to be able to use with alternate versions of the song files (higher/lower bitrate), but the iTunes LP isn't able to play the new versions of the files. What's missing? 

Right-click (control-click) the .itlp file in Finder, and Show Package Contents Open the file in a text editor (TextEdit is fine) Open a Terminal window and enter the command Quit and relaunch iTunes Find the tag in the XML file for the first song, and copy its attribute (the part between the quotation marks) Right-click (control-click) the first song in iTunes, and Get Info Because of step 3, the Grouping field will have changed to . Paste the XID copied in step 5 into this field Repeat steps 5 and 7 for each track (if they're listed sequentially in iTunes, you can use the "Next" button in the Get Info window to accomplish this more quickly Once you've assigned the XIDs for all tracks, run the iTunes LP file and everything should work Quit iTunes Open the Terminal window from before and enter the command Quit Terminal Reopen iTunes, and you're all set and back to normal 

I've been trying to make an Automator droplet that removes files of a particular extension from a directory. My Workflow has 3 actions (when I'm not debugging): 

You can also use the application X-Mouse Button Control to accomplish this. You only need to set the "Wheel Up" button to the "Scroll Window Down" command, and vice-versa. I am using this on Windows XP, but the app should work on 7 or Vista, also. It was very quick to set up, and since it's a GUI application, it was easier to use. 

I installed Lion on Partition A, so it's now 11.5 GB, after the Recovery HD partition took its share. I've tried booting holding down Option, and neither Partition A or Recovery HD show up, though both do with USB. Also, when it's plugged in with FW800, Partition A does show up in the Startup preference pane. When I select it and restart, though, it spends a long time before the Apple logo shows up, and I end up booted to my default, internal disk. I tried plugging directly into the front FW800 port, and also through other (LaCie) drives daisy chained to a rear port, and that made no difference. This is very frustrating, and would potentially make me return the drive if I can't find a solution. What could be causing this? 

I just turned on Google syncing in my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X) Address Book, but I'm not seeing my Address Book groups in Gmail or Google Voice. Is this supposed to be the case? Is there a way to get it to work? 

I have a file whose extension is .log, though I have this particular file set to open in TextWrangler instead of Console.app (using "Open with" in Finder's Get Info panel). I have a Bash shell script () that uses SED to replace some text in a file, inline, like so: 

Get Folder Contents (Repeating for each subfolder) Filter Finder Items (File extension is "part") Move Finder Items to Trash 

Download an older version of Firefox here. If you are trying to back down from 57, you'll want to grab 56.0.2, (Windows US English version 32 bit exe) here. You can look at all of their 56.0.2 releases here. Wait until the download finishes. Find your profile folder. You can find where that is here. Also, this Mozilla Support article covers steps 3, 4, and 5 of this answer. Close Firefox. Back up your profile folder. You can simply copy the folder somewhere else, just in case stuff goes sideways. Find the executable you downloaded in step 1. Run it. Go through the installer, and when its complete, launch Firefox. My previous session, extensions, and settings were all as they were before the upgrade/downgrade. I was pleasantly surprised. 

I would try looking at the Windows Event Viewer right after the crash occurs. More than likely there's a problem that's being reported there and you can track it down by looking at the information available. Start with and go down from there: 

Like most new Firefox features, the only thing I want to do with them is turn them off. Firefox 42 or 43 implemented this new search/preview/magnifying glass thing, and trying to search The Internets for a way to turn it off has not been fruitful thus far. This link talks about Chrome as far as I can tell, and it's from 2010. The feature I'm referring to is very new. Is there a way to turn this off? Usually there's a setting in about:config that disable the new features that they roll out. 

I let Firefox auto update and I don't like some new feature, the new GUI, or it broke something. How do I roll back or downgrade? NOTE: Potential duplicate questions (1, 2) did not come up in a search of SuperUser, but they did as suggested questions when I typed the title. Weird. Those other questions do not give instructions on how to downgrade Firefox, simply pointing to where you can find older versions. Such referring-only questions are no longer welcome on SuperUser. 

For some strange reason, the script is outputting the IP address in the form of , or if I comment out the piped output from the import line, I get this: . In trying to debug this, I added as the first line in the loop. I can only guess I'm running into some kind of object vs string issue, or I am pulling in additional formatting somehow, but I can't get past it. I only want to work with an actual IP address, I don't want the leading and trailing formatting What am I doing wrong? How do I get rid of the extra formatting? 

I have a WRT54G and I loaded OpenWRT 10.03 to it according to this article. There was no Wi-Fi after loading it, so I connected via Ethernet and can log in to the LuCi interface. There's an option to enable Wi-Fi. Enabling it does not enable the Wi-Fi. Resetting the unit to factory defaults does not enable the Wi-Fi. I don't see much on the web nor Super User about this problem, so I'm guessing I did something wrong. I will try resending the firmware again. What else can I do or try to get things working? I don't see any instructions about how to configure this (like a 1st time Wi-Fi config), from what I can tell, it should just work. EDIT It turns out that this particular file will not enable Wi-Fi by default. Therefore, you have to connect wired and turn it on. I did several loads/resets, and loaded to v3 and v2.2 to determine this. 

So theres this question in my book and it doesn't state exactly how to go about actually calculating utilization anywhere, and i'm not being able to find any substantial information regarding everything i need to solve this question.(My mid term is next week). Anyway, here's the question: 

The main reason for keeping AHCI on when you use a SSD to install windows is to instruct the OS to run its TRIM command. Once this has been activated windows will continue to run the TRIM command. My current set up is similar to yours, if not identical in implementation. I have a 6Gb/s Intel 830 128 gb SSD which i installed windows 8 on using AHCI. Trim is currently running. I have 2 x 320gb HDs in RAID 0 as well. My current BIOS setting for Hard drive orientation is RAID, this is so that it sets up the array each time. You can even keep other singular drives on the other SATA controllers, you need to actually specify the drives used in RAID for them to be so. Therefore to answer your question, no they won't affect it at all. The RAID setting in the BIOS just informs the controller that it needs to set up and maintain a specific array that needs to be defined in the RAID BIOS(yes the controller has its own BIOS). For reference i leave my BIOS mode in RAID. Hope this helps, i can answer any other specific questions you have as i have had considerable experience with RAID 

The drivers are currently in no state to be called anything but beta drivers. The support is abysmal. However, reinstall them using these methods. But before you do, make sure you purge the current drivers using: 

my computer started crashing to a completely black display where it would try and restart immediately. First it was happening during a game only and i thought it was some memory leak within the game that was causing it. After a day i tried again and everything was back to normal. But then tonight it started happening all the time and it even crashed once while i was in the BIOS. This obviously helped a lot with the diagnosis because i now i know for a certainty that it's hardware related. So i tried to play around with the RAM, i own 12 gigs of ram half of which are around a year older than the other half. So i played around with the DIMM orientations till finally it kept happening even when i was down to 6 gigs of ram. Mind you at one point i had 6 gigs installed but only 4 gigs showing up as usable, which is what lead me to believe it was the RAM or the DIMM. I currently have 4 x 2gig triple channel memory sticks installed, but windows only shows 6 gigs, of course it should show 8. I had previously thought it was one of the DIMM channels, but now it seems to be random. As a result, I am now a bit stumped. I know its not my gfx card, the chances of a CPU malfunction are extremely slim, and i've had normal temperatures always, i run a liquid loop too. I've ruled out the RAM sticks that i own, well not all of them, but the random DIMM slots malfunctioning doesn't seem to be fit that situation. My last two places to turn my attention are the motherboard and my PSU. I own an ASUS Rampage III Extreme and i know these things are notorious for causing problems from nowhere. My PSU is a Corsair HX 1000W and i'm more inclined to thinking that its not the PSU but i'm not sure, i just trust corsair more. Also, there are no Error reports, only sometimes does Windows report that something bad went wrong, i'm sure there are memory dumps, but i'm not sure what you guys would need. My Specs: Windows 8 Professional 64-Bit. i7-950 - Stock speed for now. GSkill -12 gigs 1600Mhz RAM. GTX 580 from EVGA. 128 Gb SATA 3 Samsung 830 series. Essence Xonar STX. 2 x 320 Gb Samsung F4s in RAID 0. H75 Corsair Liquid Cooling System. Corsair HX1000W. If you guys can think of anything, i would greatly appreciate it. TIA
