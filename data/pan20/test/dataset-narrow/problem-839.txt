You don't need you own DNS, when everybody is just using the internet and you don't have to manage your own servers. VPN sounds to me like internal services, jst kepp them internal. 

My guess would be that some traffic on port TCP 443 (HTTPS) is allowed. OpenVPN uses UDP:1194 (and a properitary handshake) so it will not work. Try SSTP (like Microsoft does in its RRAS) or another SSL-Tunneling VPN. Otherwise follow ptman's answer. You don't have to root the app itself, just wireshark the WLANs traffic. 

I have a very strange NTFS rights phenomenon on a fileserver and I cannot find my mistake, pulling my hair out for hours now. What am I missing? My goal is: 

Have a look at Get-NetTCPConnection. Use this cmdlet to view TCP connection properties such as local or remote IP address, local or remote port, and connection state. Use this for example to list 

Linux (based) fileservers do not have a filesystem with ACLs like windows does (with NTFS or ReFS). You simply can not keep all your NTFS-Settings like ACLs, Junctions, Filestreams or extended attributes on a non-NTFS filesystem. Most Linux FS expose the POSIX attributes (OWNER, GROUP, RIGHTS). If you have more than one group entry, you'd have to greate one group for each and every ACL-Kombination. But you can export your NFTS ACLs. Use this command to backup you NTFS permissions: 

Link aggregation is not the same as Teaming. LACP doesn't do failover (by default), for example. It just fills one link, then switches transparently over to the next. No mac-addresses involved here. No connection-tracking on a higher protocol level, like on teaming. 

I would set up a local ActiveDirectory, as you said, with users, passwords, shares, group policys and roaming folders. AzureAD can't do that (maybe it will). So everyone can login everywhere and his/hers desktop is just there - realtime, works offline and everything is under your control. Bonus: it manages your local network (DHCP, DNS, AV ...), too. Then, get some office 365 plans for exchange, sharepoint and all the nice office stuff. For you local server, a small "Starter" machine will do the job just fine. Grab a solid i5/4gb/SSD box and install server 2016 on it. 

You can change the StartProcess behaviour, not the Scheduler itself. You can, for example, allow the Administrators as the only account for controlling process starting scheduling priorities. This is done here: 

In most cases I personally use | select-object FOO | Out-GridView, so nothing gets hidden and I can sort/search the resultset afterwards. 

SMB protocol handshake is always SMB, for backwards compatibility. The connection is upgraded later on. If you deny all packets with SMB headers, no connection will be established. You cann see this in a successful protocol negotiation: 

Windows 10 (Pro, x64) supports 2 sockets with 256 logical cores and up to 512GB RAM, so no problem here. To be more precise, Windows 10 supports a maximum memory configurations that was formerly available only in the realm of servers: 

There is none. In Windows, new files and folders will (by default) inherit the permissions of the directory that they are originally created in. So you should be looking at changing the ACLs on the parent directory, involving CREATOR_OWNER access rights. 

Conversion happens at Layer 2, at the "MAC Layer". Thats one layer below IP - Routing happens just on Layer 3, where Packets do have IP-Adresses. In this case the MAC-Address of the Laptops wireless-interface would send the Request to the AP, the AP converts 1:1 it into a LAN-Packet on the cable and it would reach the server unchanged. No need to cache a pool of anything. 

Here you notice the IP address 192.168.1.1 This is the IP address of the only server which has the permission to scavenge the zone. Most likely this could be a server which is no longer existing - this happens a lot in Domains with a funktion level of 2008. If this is not the IP address of the server which on which you have configured Scavenging, you need to change that. To change the Scavenging server for a zone, run the command: 

If this User logs on (he is just in two groups, Domain-Users and Group-A), he can edit, delete, rename and move the file bild1.jpg. How is this possible? What does NTFS do with my glorious plans? 

The default is 0, which means that no additional critical kernel worker threads are added. Which is usualy ok. This value affects the number of threads that the file system cache uses for read-ahead and write-behind requests. Raising this value can allow for more queued I/O in the storage subsystem (which is good, when you want to write line-by-line), but it's more CPU expensive. Add more Queue Length Increasing the "AdditionalCriticalWorkerThreads" value raises the number of threads that the file server can use to service concurrent requests. 

I hope that helps. If it was me to fix this, I would examine running services, check for copy protection, patch the machine and look for the latest WinCC updates. 

There is no such thing as "Layer 2 Port forwarding". The MAC Layer is just the access layer, there are no ports to connect or forward. I think your router is learning just one IP from it's connected clients by matching it to it's MAC-Table. Sometimes this is done to stop forwarding if a device is down, to limit the traffic on the WAN side. Thats stupid, but ... In that case, all you can do is fix the multihome MAC. 

Synchronization of profile folders is not managed by the authentication/authorization, but by the managment - Group Policy Management in case of windows. You will need an Active Directory to achive that. 

DHCP does not deny a IP address to a client; longer lease times or manual configuration ognore reservations. A reservation only kicks in when the client is reuqesting a address. 

The default location for user logon scripts is the NETLOGON share, which, by default, is replicated on all DC in your forest, and is physically located in . If you set a user logon script (ADUC > User > Properties > Logon > Logon-Script > hello.cmd), it is executed from NETLOGON. "Official" best practice is: 

There is no "File Size per User" limit in windows. The FSRM (File Server Resource manager) can set quotas per disk and per folder (per user or group), but not a single Max-File-Size thing. 

The default is 20. An indication that the value may need to be increased is if the SMB2 work queues are growing very large (perfcounter ‘Server Work Queues\Queue Length\SMB2*’. should be <100). 

The field shows the length of the time that it took for the request to be completely processed by HTTP.sys. The time stamp is initialized when HTTP.sys receives the first byte of the request (so network latency is included here). HTTP.sys is the kernel-mode component that is responsible for HTTP logging for IIS activity. The time stamp is initialized before HTTP.sys begins parsing the request. is stopped when the last (HTTP-) response occurs. So the answer is yes and no. Yes, it's the time when the request reaches HTTP.sys and no, it's not the time to measure if you want the time for IIS' reply. For example, a POST request with 2megs of payload will take a lot longer to reach your application (time-taken) than a short WebDAV keep-alive message. But both will have the same 'time' stamp. If you had subtractd one from the other, the long request would have "been there", even before it was sent. 

No, and it shouldn't be. The header TTL is vital for the network, as it kills paket that travel for too long. Thats the same for all protocol types, including ICMP. 

Clean up your local credential store and check the network connection. I have seen this many, many times and the cause was always a 'thing' in the credentail store (just delete the entry) or a faulty network connection (vmware Tools, NIC driver, Firewall, ...). 

The IIS logs are the correct place to look for this. Just make sure, all the applications write them (sometimes they are disabled). 

Yes, the Windows-Firewall. It would be interesting to hear, what you mean by 'remote access'. RDP? RPC? WMI? 

No, not without access to the ISPs systems (or access to the system killing your TTL information, like firewalls sometimes do). The routers on the way do have to increment the TTL of ICMP packets, if the don't do that, they behave completely transparent - just like switches (which you kannot detect by traceroute). 

The simple answer: not. If it's AV/Screening/Driver stuff, the lock occurs in the (kernel) FS-API, which is not visible to processes in userland. If it's in Userland, the administrator's procmon or, with more comfort, handle.exe will show the culprit to you. You can use handle.exe to see the programs that have a file open, or to see the object types and names of all the handles of a program - IF there are such. 

Try to pass then. will pass anything that follows onto the embedded MSI installer. The /qn is an msiexec switch indicating to run with no UI. The "wierd" format is required because that is how the InstallShield command-line parser is programmed to function. Likely, they built it this way to ensure msiexec switches/properties will be unambiguous on the command-line and within scripts. 

If the machine FILE-OLD has been turned off (and removed from the domain), you cann add an alternative alias to the new servers (real) name. This is done in the domain, which wil take care of the rest, like SPNs, DNS records and double-nameed-sessions. 

That is because the cmdlet itself does not create in internal object[property] for . $_.PasswordExpired is a method, not a static property so it has to be called when its filled. Because of the (slow) speed of big queries (with that number of properties), the -Filter was implemented to reduce the output-calls, not the same way as the object[property] pipeline. So you have to a) filter the objects as they become one in the pipe (I would recommend this, I just filter almost everything in [filter-]pipes) or b) filter the text output (select-string). The 'correct' way then would be the way you just did it: 

The /T switch allows it to get subfolder permissions too. The /C switch allows it to continue even if errors are encountered. Errors will still be displayed. Use this command to restore them: 

A computer is never "reporting" to the domain that a user "is still logged on", this is not an AD thing. FSSO is polling the state from the delegated kerberos node (which is fetched from AD, thats right). I would change the authentication time for FSSO. Connect to CLI and: 

This change will enable the processing of external meeting requests. The meeting request, however, is still subject to being accepted/rejected based on availability of the room and any other booking policies. Note (fooled myself with this one a few times): This change will only take effect for new requests. Any meeting requests from external senders that were received before the setting was enabled will not be processed. 

Possible: Yes. Recommend: No. You could use private v4 adresses as needed. Or does the whole setting need to go public completely? 

The physics is actually much easier than it seems at first glance: Power generators are engines just like the everyday ones we see all around in our cars, lawnmowers, snowblowers, etc. Except for new power sources like some wind and solar systems with electronic inverters, the vast majority of power is supplied by large rotating AC generators turning in synch with the frequency of the grid. The frequency of all these generators will be identical and is tied directly to the RPM of the generators themselves, generally 3600 RPM for gas turbines and 1800 RPM for nuclear plants. If there is sufficient power in the generators then the frequency can be maintained at the desired rate (i.e. 50Hz or 60Hz depending on the locale). The power from the individual generators will lead the grid in phase slightly by an amount roughly corresponding to the power they deliver to the grid. An increase (=defect) in the power load will cause this rotating frequency to drop. So a battery systems like this is designed to keep short-term fluctuations in power requirements from dropping the frequency because of lags in the governors and generators which require a finite time to adjust to the new power requirements. These "frequency regulator" power stations can supply very high power for short bursts to keep the power requirements even so that the other generators don't see too much load faster than they can respond due to mechanical limitations. If this does not happen somehow, your UPS will be killed. 

"Terminal Services Gateway" (TS Gateway) is the technology you are looking for. RDP over HTTPs with session collection and management. Maybe in combination with the TS Session Broker Role. It's included and fully suported in Windows Server 2012R2+. As the only supported HTTPs session/proxy/encryption/lbs gateway. On the plus side: It has a Web-Broker with (if you want) SSO and - optionally - certificate authentication. 

In general, all Windows 10 editions support a maximum of two physical CPUs, but the number of logical processors or cores varies based on the processor architecture. For example, a maximum of 32 cores is supported in 32-bit versions of Windows 8/10, whereas up to 256 cores are supported in the 64-bit versions. The Intel® Xeon® Gold 6140 has 18 cores (with 36 Hyper-threading 'cores'), I don't see any CPU-Related problems here. 

Update your RD-Client. ASAP. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in unpatched versions of CredSSP. An attacker could relay user credentials or execute code on the target server. RDS uses a lot of CredSSP. The windows security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how CredSSP validates requests during the authentication process. Additionally, the latest patch for the windows servers disable CredSSP (RD) logins from unpatched (vulnerable) clients. There is also a GPO to control the beviour of the server when older clients connet (). But I would highly recommend updating your clients. 

There is a lot of authorisation, authentication and handshaking going on, even before any client data has been submitted. In the different versions of the protocol, things changed quite a lot. If you need a special behaviour, use the appropriate version. The good news: Your password is never sent through an unsecured connection nor is it used as a key for anything. This wouldn't be possible anyway, since the authenticating machine nevers has access to it. 

The unattended setup cannot do that. The setup is not (yet) able to manage storage-spaces and/or create dynamic discs in pools. [update: formating fail] I think it should be possible to do that with post-install scripting, so maybe you try this one: Create the mirror'd pool in Powershell 

To my knowledge, it's possible that the good old Nagle is kicking your balls here. I would recommend you to test switching it off and also reduce the internal ticks-to-reply counter. This is done in the registry: 

Sure, whatever you need. Personally I'd use ESXi on this, but windows will probably do the job, too. 

Not. Distributing Payload to multiple (IP-)endpoints is not possible with no (IP-)endpoints. TCP connection distriubution over mac controllers, on the other hand is. As long as the traffic is coming from various sources (and not from a single one, like a router) this often works pretty well. 

By default a room mailbox does not permit external users to make bookings. However there is an option that you can configure to allow external people to make bookings if you need them to. It's the ProcessExternalMeetingMessages flag. 

Depends on the configuration of the AP. In this case I would recommend to setup the AP as a bridge. In bridge mode you can think of the AP/WiFi as a cable: Everything is just the same as in a cable network - the AP "converts" all packets from the wireless interface to the ethernet and back. No routing, no DHCP no nothing, besides the same existing things on your LAN. 

Look into the file and check the Line . Maybe you see an IP-Adress instead of the asterisk ("*"). Just you new IP-Adress there and restart the Service (`apache2ctl restart'). 

Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications/services. It's possible that a Windows-Update caused an incompatibility to one of your modules. The only way (known to me) to get the exact Applicatin name, is a remote kernel debugger. What will most likely not cause this error? 

Yes. Distribution, teaming and aggregation are just not the same thing and they are not exchangeable. For example, if the main traffic source you are whishing to distribute to more physical adapters is a singe-mac-source (Large Server, other VM-Host, Router, Firewall ...), LACP would be your single choice. That's why most companys use vSphere. Virtual Switches allow their uplinks to distribute traffic based on Route ID / Originating Port ID, IP hash, mac hash, LACP and PBR (policy based routing, when using NSX). 

If an external sender attempts to book the meeting room they will not receive an acceptance or rejection message, which may lead to confusion if the room is assumed to have been successfully booked (given that the ressource hat automatic processing anabled). To configure the room mailbox to process external requests:
