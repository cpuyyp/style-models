I want to block Host 192.168.1.1 from reaching 192.168.2.0/24 network and in order to implement that I've applied Extended ACL "ACL_FOR_R2" on R2's serial2/0 interface. Now as we all know that at the end of every access list is an implied "deny all traffic" criteria statement. Therefore, if a packet does not match any of your criteria statements, the packet will be blocked. So I didn't mention any statement in the ACL "ACL_FOR_R2" assuming we only have one statement in that ACL as "deny all" but the problem is when I ping from R1 to 192.168.2.2, R2 doesn't block the traffic and ping reaches to R3. WHY? Here are the configurations: 

Transmission rate is not same as bandwidth. Channel Bandwidth – the range of signal bandwidths allowed by a communication channel without significant loss of energy (attenuation). Channel Capacity or Maximum Data rate – the maximum rate (in bps) at which data can be transmitted over a given communication link, or channel. A typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a 'large' file from one system to another system and measure the time required to complete the transfer or copy of the file. The throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in megabits, kilobits, or bits per second. From the definition I would say they would be considering propagation delay also. 

I'm preparing for my ccna and I tried to set a basic networking secession. First I added Router 1(R1) and Router 2(R2) and configured ospf on them & they worked perfectly fine but as soon as I added Router 3(R3), problem occurred. When I did "show ip int br" on router 3, I got following result: 

I am trying to capture packets with GNS3 using wireshark but wireshark is giving error message every time I run wireshark in GNS3. Path for Wireshark is "D:\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe". Same Path I mentioned in Packet capture analysis command. Screen shot od error message is attacked below: 

A call to ephone-dn 1 rings on ephone 1 and on ephone 2. Ephone 1 answers, and the call is no longer visible to ephone 2. A call to ephone-dn 2 issues a call-waiting notification to ephone 1 and rings on ephone 2, which answers. The second call is no longer visible to ephone 1. A call to ephone-dn 3 issues a call-waiting notification to ephone 1 and ephone 2. Ephone 1 puts the call to ephone-dn 1 on hold and answers the call to ephone-dn 3. The call to ephone-dn 3 is no longer visible to ephone 2. A call to ephone-dn 4 is issues a call-waiting notification on ephone 2. The call is not visible on ephone 1 because it has met the two-call maximum by handling the calls to ephone-dn 1 and ephone-dn 3. (Note that the call maximum is six for those phones that are able to handle six call-waiting calls, as previously described.) 

When Switch A's port is configured to access mode from trunk mode, Switch B's port stays in trunk mode. Switch A is DTP disabled (#switchport nonegotiate). Switch B has default configuration which is dynamic auto and DTP enabled. Is this normal? 

For router with route switch processor (RSP), if an IP address is configured for the RSP interface and the IP is pinged, is the ping forwarded to the main CPU (control plane)? Or the CPU of RSP will not forward to the main CPU and reply the ICMP itself? 

Let's say I'm migrating my network to new infrastructure. So, the new site and the old site are connected using private ASs. I wonder if there is any benefit for the new site to advertise /24 along with >=/25 to the old site. The old site only advertises >=/25 to the new site. 

Is there any rule in networking which says that the ping(echo request) reply should come from the same path from which the ping(echo request) has been sent? For example If I ping 192.168.2.1 from R1's se0/0, according to my configuration the ping(echo request) should go from R1->R2->R3'(se0/1) and reply(echo request reply) should come from R3->R4->R1'(se0/0) since I have given static routes on all routers. Configurations are as below: 

I didn't configure any routing protocol to any of the router and tried to apply static routes in order to get out of the network and I've configured static routing in a manner that if R1 sends a ping to R3, the ping should go through R2 but the reply from R3 should come from R4 but it's not working. WHY? Here are the ip addresses and static ip addresses: 

May I know is it possible to only send email of logging message interface up/down instead of based on severity level? 

Active ASA and standby ASA communicates through failover link. If active ASA detects its interface to switch is down, then it tells the standby ASA and the standby ASA becomes active. How does the switch connected to both ASAs know to divert traffic to standby ASA which becomes active after the interface to the original active ASA is down? Any required configuration on the switch? 

I am documenting equipment which requires me to state installed Physical Layer Interface Module (PLIM)/slot and transceivers/interfaces. What confused me is the different information shown between and . 

The Window Size field in each TCP header indicates the amount of empty space, in bytes, remaining in the receive buffer. The field is 16 bits in TCP, but with the Windows Scale option, values larger than 65535 can be used. Windows scale option increases the Window Size from 16 bit to 30 bit. Instead of changing the field size, however, the header still holds a 16 bit value, and an option is defined that applies a scaling factor to the 16 bit value. Window Scale RFC is 1323. (TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1.)

One of my colleague kept saying 'hopefully we do not encounter firmware issue' in a project when referring to our Cisco 9000 XR series route processor. I did not bother to ask him because he seemed confident when saying. However, as far as I know, the IOS XR is the operating system in the route processor. Or am I mistaken?
