I'm using the Windows 10 preview on a couple of machines (a laptop, and a server-2012-hosted VM). On the VM, Windows shuts itself down about every hour and has to be restarted from the Hyper-V console. There's no indication of any error; the screen shows "shutting down", and the event log records an event from the User32 source saying that NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is shutting it down: 

In your case, it seems there are only three machines and you're happy to temporarily change their domain status, which you've already tried to do by changing this setting: 

Is there a way to suppress the waving pendulum animation in Firefox tab titles during load? I'm seeing this in my latest update (57.0.1). Pretty sure it wasn't there before as it's driving me crazy. Some kind of busy indicator is obviously helpful (the good ol' whirly wheel is fine) but I find this tick-tock movement very distracting and annoying. I would prefer to change the busy indicator (or have no busy indicator at all, if that's the only way to get rid of this thing). I've searched in about:config for things like "tab" and "anim" but come up with nothing. 

Excel stores dates as a sequential number, starting with the number 1 for the date 1 January 1900. You say you're seeing 6-digit numbers. The smallest 6-digit number is 100000, which in the 1900 date system represents the date 14 October 2173. I don't know what data your employee spreadsheet contains, but unless you're actually expecting the data to contain a date so far in the future as the year 2173, this suggests there's something other than a literal date in those cells. In other words, it's not the format that's the problem, but the actual cell contents, which may be a formula involving a reference to a cell that contains something different in your worksheet from what it contains in the employee spreadsheet. To find out what data's actually causing the problem, click a cell, and look in the formula bar to see the raw contents of the cell. Do this in both spreadsheets (the employee sheet, and your master sheet). 

However, you may find it's already switched on. I noticed on a tablet after putting Windows 10 on it that the on-screen keyboard didn't pop up automatically. I had to use the Accessibility icon to get a keyboard when logging on, or I had no way enter my password. But then it seemed to settle down and it started working. You may find the same thing, and it will start working eventually. 

That's it! Ever since I added this dummy shortcut, my icons have stayed on the correct monitor after every restart. 

It seems you may have a reason for creating an app to do this, it's difficult to be certain. However, unless you do have a special reason you haven't told us about, you can achieve what you're asking using built-in browser behaviour that occurs automatically when clicking a link. For example, you might have the following link in your web page: 

Make sure Directory Browsing is selected in the list of Roles and Features for IIS. (It is selected by default when you add the IIS role, so you probably have it.) In IIS Manager, configure the site to allow directory browsing. Open the directory browsing feature for the site: 

That's it! Back in your familiar build, Windows Update now works fine. (And any devices trashed by the update are back to normal, of course.) 

Please note: there are many similar-sounding questions/answers but they do not cover this specific need. Scripting the registry changes resulting from use of the Mouse Properties dialog is possible, and there are a variety of questions and answers about that. I can already do that. However, it seems this particular dialog does more than simply update the registry, and also notifies the driver in some way to make it pick up the new settings. I say this because the registry changes alone have no effect until OK is pressed on this dialog. 

Since support for Windows XP has ended, anyone with an occasional need to run up an XP machine will be wise to make sure it at least has all the possible updates that were made available before support ended. The obvious way to do this is to keep running Windows Update until it says no updates are currently available. Rather than rely on negative confirmation though, I'd like to be able to check and ensure the latest update is actually installed. But what's the KB identifier for the last XP update? I've been googling to try and find out, but without any success. 

Under Advanced Chipset Configuration is a setting called UMA Frame Buffer Size. This controls how much of your RAM is reserved for your graphics hardware, and by default may be set to Auto, which will decide an amount based on how much RAM you have installed and—depending on your needs—may reserve far more than necessary: 

EDIT: after posting this answer, I realized the print still comes out in black. It's only the screen view that changes (at least in my PDF reader). But it still provides a solution because you can then print a screenshot. I pasted my screenshot into Word and dragged the corner of the image to make it a bit bigger before printing it. Some PDF readers let you do it as an Accessibility setting under Preferences. For example, Foxit Reader does it here: 

This remains an issue 5 years later in Word 2013. The answer commonly given is, "you must accept the changes". My preferred solution, however, is to use Word's Document_Open event to change the initial view setting as desired: 

But as you've found, this doesn't cause the upgrade offer to pop up in the system tray. Instead, simply remove each machine from the domain, and re-add it to the domain once you've registered for your upgrade. First check you have the relevant Windows Update installed (KB3035583) by typing the following at a command prompt: 

The configuration you're using should work. I have successfully installed and run MEGAsync under Windows 10. Note that MEGAsync takes care of installing the Visual C++ 2010 runtime itself when you run setup. Evidently this was not successful in your case. Starting again from a clean slate should fix it: 

The problem is the linebreaks. If you fix these, it will import successfully. Firstly, you have missing linebreaks: 

It's not part of the file system. The file system is part of your PC. "This PC" is just a grouping that represents, well, your PC. If you had two disks installed, they would both show up here. 

Yes, a cable could cause poor performance. And especially if it's a cheap cable, which may not really meet the USB 3 electrical specification. The other possible reason is that you may have used a different USB port on your computer from what you were using previously, when you were getting 10-minute transfer times. It's quite common for computers to have just one or two USB 3 ports, and a number of USB 2 ports also. If you've used one of the USB 2 ports, that would certainly slow things down also. 

Note: this may initially trash your devices (it did for me big-time: no ethernet, no wifi, display stuck in low res with driver error message!). But: no worries, that was just a means to an end because we straight away go to Settings and choose the option to go back to the previous Windows build: 

We do not store data under Program Files. So we needed to reconfigure these settings. However, when I changed the default locations to 

I had a similar problem after removing Hyper-V, and resolved it by reconfiguring my netowork adaptor. I had to do this because I discovered the netsh commands had left things in an invalid state. According to, to pick one example of many, this blog, the following netsh command "Removes all user configured IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) settings": 

You may desire that as a snippet, but according to this old article on MSDN, a blank line identifies the start of a new registry path. It may be that Aginity had some scheme for encoding linebreaks in these registry keys which has been lost in the export process; regardless, if you remove the blank lines, it will import successfully. Here's the "fixed" version of the .reg file you posted: 

You can also run individual XP Mode applications directly from your Windows 7 Start menu, i.e., without explicitly launching XP Mode first. If you haven't enabled XP Mode on your Windows 7 machine and wish to do so, you can get it free using the Microsoft instructions here. Do note the security advice on that page, remembering XP is now no longer supported. 

Unbelievably, this dire UI behaviour is still present in Outlook 2010. And still present in Outlook 2013. EDIT: and still there in 2016, and still there in 365 as of January 2017—and even if I drag the scrollbar to the bottom of the list and back, it doesn't make subsequent scrolling work. No scrolling in lists of messages--just a jump to the place where you release the mouse. The only time scrolling works is when the list contains only about 30 messages so only just goes off the screen. The one time you hardly need scrolling! However, for those of us who happen to appreciate trackpoint scrolling, and who therefore use a keyboard sporting this feature, there's a surprise answer: for some reason trackpoint scrolling makes even Outlook lists scroll! Joy. 

The page contains what seem to be phishing links (for example, a link to "official iPhone site" goes to "track.clicksbandit.com/click". On both machines I had disabled searching from the address bar (which I detest!) so it seems this issue shouldn't have anything to do with searching invoked by Firefox. When it happened on the office machine, I had not installed any add-ins. What can be causing these malicious redirects? 

Once I re-entered my static IP settings, the yellow triangle disappeared and the network came back. To satisfy myself that netsh had really done this, I repeated the whole exercise, adding and removing Hyper-V, and exactly the same thing happened when I gave the above netsh command. It seems netsh is somewhat buggy. Its use for TCP/IP functionality should anyway be viewed as deprecated: while looking at the netsh commands I noticed advice to this effect from Microsoft, which doesn't show up when full netsh commands are used, but only when you go to the "int" (interface") level in netsh: 

This annoying bug is still present in Windows 10. After moving my icons back to the primary monitor numerous times, I hit on an idea. It worked! With your icons positioned where you want them, right-click the desktop in the secondary monitor and create a new shortcut. Doesn't matter what it's a shortcut to—you'll never use it. I pointed mine to a non-existent URL and called it "Monitor holder": 

When I hibernate Windows 8.1, sometimes it wakes briefly some hours later. (This is a pain, as it may be the middle of the night and my computer's bright blue power LED lights up the room and wakes me too!) After maybe 10 seconds, the light goes off again and stays off for a further period of hours. I have the network card set to prevent wake on LAN, and Windows Update set to download only, so it doesn't appear either of those should be waking the computer. Before I resort to putting tape over the LED, does anyone know what is causing/allowing Windows to wake during hibernation?
