The slides here provide a way to get a pfaffian orientation from Minimum Spanning Tree. MST can be found in linear time if graph is planar and weights are $1$ and the slides give a linear time orientation algorithm. 

Are Graph and Group Isomorphism problems known to be random self-reducible? If so is there a good proof? Are there other non-trivial examples of random self-reducibility? Is there a good reference? 

What is the standard way to define $EXP$-complete problem from succinct representations of $P$ complete problems that do not come from graphs if there are any? For example what is the succinct version of the $P$-complete iterated mod problem $$\mbox{given }a, b_1, b_2,\dots, b_n\in\Bbb Z,\mbox{ is }((\dots((a \bmod b_1) \bmod b_2) \dots) \bmod b_n) = 0$$ and would that be $EXP$-complete and what is the succinct version of linear programming and would that be $EXP$-complete? 

I am interested in Boolean function polynomial/rational exact/approximate/one sided approximate representation, relation to circuit/communication complexity, tools utilized to study Boolean functions (such as combinatorics, analysis, approximation theory, algebra etc). What are some of the important references, lecture notes and key papers (including survey) in the field of Boolean functions for someone wanting to learn the growth of the area from 80s till today. Even open problems in the area would be a good introduction as one can usually trace back the literature. One important open problem is sensitivity-block sensitivity conjecture. 

It is well known Lenstra's and Kannan's algorithm achieves $n$-variable parameter $L$-bit integer programming solvability in $O(n^nL)$ time and $O(L)$ space. 

Blum and Nisan show Positive Linear Programming could be done in $NC$ if we only ask for approximate solutions. This paper $URL$ introduces monotone complexity classes in monotone Turing models. 

If $PIT$ has been derandomized then still how far would we be from showing $P=BPP$? What additional barriers need to be climbed? 

I have a rather naive question on LU factorization which probably should be easy to answer. Say I have a matrix with entries only from $\{0,1\}$. When can we expect to get an LU factorization of such a matrix(whenever it exists) with entries $(a)$ from integers? $(b)$ from $\{-1,0,+1\}$? 

Reference Goppa's information theory work. $URL$ [CITATION] Nonprobabilistic mutual information without memory VD Goppa - Probl. Contr. Inform. Theory, 1975 I know no other work which uses group theory to frame information theory. 

Consider $t$-String distance where Alice has $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and Bob has $y\in\{0,1\}^n$ and they have to decide if $t\leq|x\oplus y|$ or not. 

Can intersection of two languages in NP which are not NP complete be NP complete? Can intersection of two languages in coNP which are not coNP complete be coNP complete? Can intersection of two languages one in coNP but not complete and other in NP but not NP complete be NP complete or coNP complete? 

Assume we have two strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ of lengths $cn$ and $cm$ bits resepctively for some $c\in\Bbb N$. Assume that the Levenshtein distance (minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions)) between $S_1$ and $S_2$ over binary alphabet is $L(2)$. For any $b$ such that $b>1$ and $b|c$ consider the strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ over alphabet $\{0,1,\dots,2^b-1\}$. Assume the Levenshtein distance between $S_1$ and $S_2$ over $b$-ary alphabet is $L(2^b)$. Is there any relation between $L(2)$ and $L(2^b)$ in general? Can we say anything for LCS (minimum number of insertions or deletions) distance as well? 

Let $f$ be boolean function, $M_f$ be it communication matrix, $t(f)$ be covering number of $M_f$ and $\chi(f)$ be partition number of $M_f$. We know that there is an $f$ such that $\chi(f)=2^{(\log rank_\Bbb R(f))^{1+c}}$ at some $c>0$ (page $12$ in $URL$ 

In $\Bbb F_q[x]$ given $d\in\Bbb N$ there is a deterministic $O(poly(nd\log q))$ algorithm to find an irreducible polynomial with $d=deg(x)$ under $GRH$ and an unconditional randomized algorithm. 

Is it known $\mathsf{RNC=NC\iff P=RP}$ or $\mathsf{BPNC=NC\iff P=BPP}$? Are there any analogies (such as collapse results, problems which suggest analogies such as gcd(in NC) and factoring (in P), potential analogies such as (perfect matching in BPNC as to something else in BPP etc) between $\mathsf{NC}$ hierarchy and $\mathsf{PH}$ hierarchy? 

Note that if we explicitly write down the matrix with Pfaffian orientation we need $\Omega(|V|^2)$ space to write down the matrix. But since number of edges is only $O(|V|)$ we might be able to get away with linear time algorithm for counting number of perfect matchings of a planar graph. Is this possible? 

We known $DET\in NC^2$. Supposing the given $n\times n$ matrix has at most $O(1)$ entries per row and column 

Given a convex polytope let the width of the polytope be $d$ and the farthest euclidean distance between any points in the polytope be $e$. Denote $\mathcal P(a,c)$ to be the set of convex polytopes in $\Bbb R^n$ presented by $O(n^a)$ linear inequalities with $e/d=O(n^c)$. 

Likewise is there a possible classification of which P-complete or NL-complete or in general P problems are likely to have counting problems #P-hard and not in #P-hard? 

There are many streaming algorithms with sublinear randomized space but linear deterministic space. Does $P=BPP$ have anything to do with derandomizing space and more importantly but not related to streaming does derandomizing time have anything to do with $L=RL$? 

Aho says $D(f)=O(N(f)N(\overline f))$ where $D(f)$ is deterministic communication complexity and $N(f)$ is non-deterministic version. 

Call a discrete logarithm algorithm functoral if the commutative algebraic object that the algorithm acts on can be changed with another commutative object in the same category and the algorithm does not asymptotically slowdown. Why is it difficult to develop a single functoral discrete logarithm (classical) algorithm that works on all commutative groups? 

May be this is trivial but I do not know the answer. As far as we know $$\mathsf{BPP}\subseteq\mathsf{\Sigma}_2\cap\mathsf{\Pi}_2$$ holds. As far as we know $$\mathsf{NP}\cup\mathsf{coNP}\subseteq\mathsf{BPP}\subseteq\mathsf{\Sigma}_2\cap\mathsf{\Pi}_2$$ could hold. Am I correct in this? If so is there a problem that is currently known to be in $$\mathsf{BPP}\backslash\mathsf{NP}\cup\mathsf{coNP}=\mathsf{BPP}\cap\overline{\mathsf{NP}}\cap\overline{\mathsf{coNP}}$$ but conjectured to be in $\mathsf{P}$ just because of our belief $$\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{BPP}$$ should be true essential verdict? That is is there a natural problem (not amalgamated ones) with a randomized poly algorithm nevertheless does not have a short yes or no certificate? A problem that comes close is PIT which is not known to be in $\mathsf{NP}$ but is in $\mathsf{coNP}$ which is the basis of the amalgamated problem (non-natural) below by Ricky Demer. 

Given $AX\leq B$ where $A\in\Bbb Z^{m\times n}$,$B\in\Bbb Z^m$ finding $X\in\Bbb Z^n$ where $m\geq n$ is the integer programming problem. If $A$ is totally unimodular then the problem is solvable in polynomial time ($(mn)^c$ arithmetic operations on $(mn)^c$ sized words suffices). Supposing we have the promise that the number of feasible solutions is polynomial then under what conditions can the problem be solved in polynomial time using Kannan's and Barnivok's algorithm (other than total unimodularity)? 

Let $H$ be $\{-1,+1\}$ Hadamard matrix of size $2$ and $J$ be the same size all $1$ matrix. Let $W$ be $\frac{H+J}{2}$. Is the discrepancy of $W^{\otimes k}$ atmost $\sqrt{k^{-1}}$? 

Consider $(\alpha,t)$-String distance where Alice has $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and Bob has $y\in\{0,1\}^n$ and they have to decide if $(1-\alpha)t\leq|x\oplus y|\leq (1+\alpha)t$ or not when $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $0\leq t\leq n$ holds. The problem interpolates somewhere between an equality function and set disjointness problem. 

It is shown in An average-case depth hierarchy theorem for Boolean circuits a random oracle makes $PH$ infinite. 

Given optimization problems $P1$ and $P2$. The slides below say that, $P1 \leq_L P2$ does not imply $P2 ∈ APX$, then $P1 ∈ APX$. Why is this so? $URL$ $MAX INDEP SET$ is not in APX while $MAX CUT$ is. Is an L reduction, $MAX INDEP SET$ $\leq_L$ $MAX CUT$ possible? The above implication does not say this is impossible. Is there an inspiration to understand this from why $MAX INDEP SET$ is not in APX while $MAX CUT$ is? 

Is it known that $\mathsf{IP}\notin\mathsf{NP}^{cc}\cup\mathsf{coNP}^{cc}$ where $\mathsf{IP}$ is inner product communication complexity problem? Where is the classification of $\mathsf{IP}$ currently in? 

Showing $NEXP^{NP}\not\subseteq P/poly$ needs Karp-Lipton. What is the best $i.o.P/poly$ lower bound result we know? As of this writing this is $EXP^{\Sigma_2P}\not\subseteq i.o.P/poly$. 

Given matrix $M\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$, let the minimum number of monochromatic rectangles it can be partitioned be $p$. Let the positive rank of $M$ be $\sigma$ and the rank be $r$. Is it known either $$p<r^{\log^dr}\mbox{ or }p<\sigma^{\log^c\sigma}\mbox{ or }p<(\sigma^{\log^c\sigma}r^{\log^dr})$$ hold true for some $c,d>0$? Can $p<\sigma^{c}$ be true?
