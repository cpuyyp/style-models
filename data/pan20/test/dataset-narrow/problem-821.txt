You should really consider pfsense which is a embedded distribution that does FW/Router and captive portal. It is extremely simple to use and works great. 

The company at which I am working is looking to upgrade their reverse proxies from an old FreeBSD install. We just installed Cisco IronPort appliances for standard web filtering and we really like the way these things work. We are looking for something similar to do reverse proxying. Requirements are : 

You can use Xen and Remus. Remus keeps a live copy of your VM which takes over if the original copy dies on you. From $URL$ : 

You should consider desktop virtualization with specific applications such as Citrix XenDesktop. They deliver the applications to the user's desktop while being executed on the servers. 

I pretty much agree with womble. I would add that option 1 doesn't necessarily bring downtime. If you have some sort of redundancy, this option will be the best. Not having such redundancy means any software problem will take down the service and will mean bad uptime. I think you should consider option 1 with a little redundancy =) 

You would be better off stress testing services instead of the machine itself. For Apache testing ab is an incredible tool. 

It depends what you mean by trunk. In Cisco language, a trunk is a 802.1Q port that will tag VLANs. You can do this by activating 802.1Q. In rest-of-the-world language, a trunk is an agregate of two ports. You take two physical ports and bond them together to have one logical port with twice the bandwidth. This goes along with protocols such as LACP. 

Gmail has nothing to do with your VPS. All you have to do is modify the DNS entries for your domain name. You necessarily have a control panel to do such thing. 

Also, I will be trying the reports:prune task without the "orphaned" option as mentionned as well as the other alternatives and will keep this question updated. Edit 2 I ran the reports:prune rake task and, despite deleting 230000 reports, it kept on eating more space... I will therefore move on to the other options. 

You can use WinSCP or FileZilla to access the file via SCP (and also maybe SFTP). You download the file on your machine then you can edit it with any editor your heart desires. Once you're done, all you have to do is upload it back onto the server. On a side note, you should consider learning how to use VIM which is the standard for Unix text editing. 

Proxies on the LAN are only useful if you're going to be doing some kind of filtering or accounting. I don't see them being useful in your case as long the app usage stays on the LAN. 

You can also create your bridge by hand which works perfectly fine also and tends to be more upgrade-proof. 

Pfsense can do most of this if you add extra packages which are easily installable inside the distribution. It is also very stable and intuitive to use. 

I have the exact the same problem as you but for a slighty bigger network. I would suggest you to use Pfsense which is based on BSD and is configured via an extremely powerful yet simple and clear web interface. It is firewalling a zones of 70 servers on a Celeron 3Ghz processor with 2GB of RAM (largely unused). Configuring it as a transparent bridge was the most efficient setup as it allowed to modify practically nothing on the actual architecture. I therefore suggest you either get one nice Dell server (low end will be far enough) for reliability of the hardware components and install pfsense on it. Or you can reuse two older servers on PFsense with redundancy (CARP) which is really simple to configure. 

There exists VGA splitters that take a single VGA output and emulate a huge resolution which is split on two or three other screens. Matrox makes these I believe. Another way is to go SLI, that will allow you to go up to 4 VGA outputs. 

With most Cisco switches, you can apply ACLs on switch ports without going any routing trouble. This works with L2 switchs such as the Catalyst 2960G. 

I should also mention that XenServer includes everything that you need to install on top of bare metal. With Xen.org you need to install it yourself which can be very challenging/fun/interesting (pick whichever one fits the context). 

In theory, this will work. You will have to setup a port forwarding from the extra public IP to the original IP. In your case, extraIP:80 to originalIP:81. I have such a setup with iptables. It was designed to ease migration between to IP different public IP ranges. Basically, the "old" public IP would be NATed to the "new" public IP. The NAT went through the Internet without a problem. I doubt it will work with you modem/router. It is most likely only able to do port forwarding to IP on it's LAN. The only way to find out is to try to NAT any random public IP and you will see if it works. I have tried with pfense to do this and have failed. Only IPTables has worked correctly. 

Not sure I really understand what your problem is. Here is an example configuration which is currently functionnal for a Xen 3.2.1 on Debian Lenny but also works for Xen 4.0. 

I have something very similar to what you have. We have one application located in one directory. This application is set up for mutliple different clients. The only difference between each client is the database that they use. When we set it up, I decided that having a different port for each client was not very pretty therefore we took a different approach. I know Apache is not very popular in the Rails scene but it is still a great piece of software. We used Apache's name-based virtualhost to tackle this problem along with Passenger3. In the new version, you can define a RailsEnv per virtualhost using the same application directory. The directive is called "PassengerAppGroupName". You get a virtualhost looking something like this : 

I think that what you need here is a link between your two datacentres. I'm thinking dark fiber would be your best option as you can do pretty anything you want with it but any other L2 link will do the trick. Considering such a link, you will be able to have all your edge routers in the same VRRP/HSRP/CARP group. You will need to configure them in the same way. I think you should do this for every network equipement that has a reason to be in each datacenter. Using such redundancy, the primary router will announce your routes to the world and the secondary router will just wait for it to fail. If your datacenter fails, the secondary will take over. If your primary router fails, it will also take over which could be a problem. This is why you want to have bidirectionnal communication between your datacenters. This link will also be extremely helpful for other tasks such as SAN replication which you will most likely want. 

400MB of space for a video that sounds very uncompressed... That is way too big for 3-4 minutes. For the bandwidth per month, simple math 5000 * 1 * 400 = 2TB per day. That's way too much bandwith for a normal hosting plan package. You should consider getting a dedicated server. You should also consider instantaneous bandwidth. This means you have to ask yourself : "How many users will watch the video at once at peak time ?". You're not going to need as much bandwidth if they all watch it at the same time or if they all watch it one at a time. You have to check the bit rate of your video in order to know a little more about this. 

You do not need to define a broadcast address for secondary IP addresses. Configuration for "failover" IP adresses is just the following : 

Two firewalls filtering the same LAN would sound wrong if they were back to back with no other network. You need to check these firewalls and make a map of the network in order to be able to decide. Only this will give you the information you're looking for. 

Use the open_basedir directive to confine your PHP scripts to their home directory and eventual extra application directories. This is very efficient by itself. Use hardened php because that costs nothing and it can help. Use suPHP to have PHP scripts execute as the owner of the file (one user per website) and avoid using files with bad permissions such as 777... suPHP can also allow you to have on php.ini per website so that one site's stupid requirement don't destroy everything. Mod_security is a big plus but needs to be well used and configured. 

The user has not already been created on the host as it is Puppet's job to do so. The examples I have found all over seem to be the same as this but since this isn't working, I am definitely missing something. 

Cisco's implementation of IPSec is not compatible with anything else then Cisco. I know IPSec is a standard but Cisco has a specific implementation that will keep you from connecting anything else then their equipements. Is it possible to configure this tunnel on my Windows Server 2008? Can it be done using only Windows tools, or do I need an additional free / commercial VPN software? Yes you need the Cisco VPN Client. It is free for IPSec and works just fine. Just be careful as it is made for desktop clients. It may have some annoying functionnalities such as short timeouts. If it cannot be done on a virtual linux box, will I have to buy and setup a Cisco router to handle the IPSec + GRE tasks? You can always buy a Cisco box that does IPSec. Be careful you may need specific licensing to do IPSec. This will be the most reliable and simple option by far. On the other hand, it's not a free solution. A small Cisco ASA 5505 will do the trick. Also, you don't need to have an extra public IP address. Using the same IP you use for everything else will be fine. 

I would recommend the Cisco ASA 5510. It has a maximum throughput of 300Mbps which is enough for you. It can also Active/Passive clustering in case you want to go down the high availability road. In case you need to evolve, it can do content filtering (CSC-SSM), Intrusion Prevention (SSM-AIP) and IPsec/SSL VPN. 

I'm going to have to disagree here... The fact that the ARM has no virtualization technology is not an argument at all. Xen and OpenVZ do not need processor virtualization extensions. If it makes sense is not so much a question of hardware but of software. In your setup, I would recommend OpenVZ which will create specific environments for each of your services. I'm 99.9% sure Xen will run on it as well but it will be much slower. So, I think it can make sense if you use efficient virtualization software (of which VMWare and Hyper-V are obviously excluded). Will it be blazing fast ? No definently not but it will work. In a more-or-less similar context, I once setup a Sempron LE 1.8Ghz system with 2GB of RAM. With Xen, we had 7 Debian Lenny VM running and it ran fine. Obviously, you can't do that with VMWare but that doesn't mean you can't do it at all. EDIT : Puppet is just automation software. OpenVZ/Xen provide isolation of your services and ressource allocation algorithms to make sure each "box" has a fair share of ressources. With puppet, ressource allocation would be taken care of by regular kernel. OpenVZ/Xen would keep any software conflict from happening (because of the isolation) but with Puppet you're on your own. So we are looking at two very different things. 

I am trying to configure Apache Virtual Hosts with Puppet and have been trying different things with little success. I have defined a node as the following : 

I am currently planning to implement 802.1X authentication for all the wired computers at the office where I work at currently. We have successfully implemented 802.1X authentication with login/password credentials. It authenticates against a RADIUS server. The RADIUS server is a Microsoft IAS. Alongside the wired network, we have an ARUBA wifi controller which does 802.1X authentication with certificates. We are wishing to use the same certificates to authenticate wired computers. This just does not seem to work. The problem seems to be at the Cisco switch level. The computer sends the credentials to the switch but the switch just ends the EAP session with an error. The RADIUS server is never contacted. There my question is the following : do Cisco switches support 802.1X EAP authentication with certificates ? If yes, what are the specifics to this type of setup ? Thank you in advance for your help, Antoine
