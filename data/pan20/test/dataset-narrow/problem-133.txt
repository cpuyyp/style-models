You can't determine configured hostname by using IP or MAC. You can do it with CDP or LLDP, if protocol is enabled on interface of the switch. 

This is autoconfigured link local address. First 64 bits are always fe80:: according to RFC 4291. Last 64 bits are interface ID. Interface ID is modified MAC address. You can disable autoconfiguration: 

Both IPv4 and IPv4 vrf TEST22 address families have Lo0 as the source. As long as IPv4 adjacency is I assume Lo0 is not in VRF. That makes your BGP source inaccessible. 

Traffic steering is actually the task that is beyond MPLS TE itself. TE tunnel just provides the path, and it's up to other protocols and techniques to steer actual traffic. The same is true for bandwidth reservation. TE just says "there are 300 mbps reserved", but nothing stops your client from sending more than that. So, your options are policies, static routes and IGPs. If you want granular control you go with static routes and policies. If you just want to get fast restoration you go with announcing tunnels into IGP. Steering technique depends on your task. 

I've done some tests with different MTU values. All tests were performed for mobile data, no voice affected or tested. Results are as follows: 

The definition is correct. On layer 3, IP addresses are used to identify machines throughout different networks. Basically you can think of it like this: 

Link-state and distance vector aren't actual routing protocols, but types of routing protocol. Since different environments have different requirements, there are different routing protocols. The protocol internet routing works on (BGP) is a distance vector protocol, because it is extremely scalable. Also, you don't want to be dependant on the link state information from other companies to route your traffic. You basically only want to know if they can get the traffic towards the destination and if they are closer to the destination than yourself and the other systems you are connected to. 

A 'normal' GRE tunnel is a used as a point-to-point connection. A /30 (or even /31) would be a better use of your subnet space. There also exist multipoint GRE tunnels, such as DMVPN. Here you can have multiple tunnel endpoints connected to one tunnel interface. In that case, you will want a bigger subnet. 

These addresses are nowhere in the internet routing tables, so if you would send a packet with a destination in these ranges on the backbone of the internet, they will simply get dropped. This is because millions of people use the same addresses. These addresses need to be translated to something useful for the internet. This is where Network Address Translation comes in: We have two computers: 

PPPoE stands for Point-to-point protocol over Ethernet. It is protocol designed to transmit PPP frames over Ethernet network with additional Ethernet header. This protocol is used for obtaining PPP software properties (e. g. call to some station and thereby establish stateful connection) over Ethernet infrastructure. 

VPWS and Xconnect is about the same technology. VPWS is the name of technology, xconnect - keyword for configuring pseudowire. You can find different naming like VLL, L2VC, PWE3, etc. Essentially they are referring to the same technology of p2p l2 connections. You can find more info in RFC 4664 For instance section 1.3 says: 

Flow is a chain of packets combined by some attribute. For different protocols attributes are different (ports, seq numbers, etc). Load balancing in LAG may differ, but usually per-flow load balancing is being used. When per-flow balancing is used, flow is guaranteed to be transmitted via the same link. On the other hand it is possible to balance based on packet (per-packet balancing). It's not usually the case because of issues, such as out-of-order packets. You should consider using different hash methods based on your traffic profile. If you have big diversity of MAC addresses (e. g. L2 switched domain), use MAC for hash. If you have big diversity of IP addresses (e. g. small L2 domain + routing), use IP for hash. 

In this picture, when PC0 sends a packer to PC1, it will send a packet with source IP address 192.168.1.10 (it's own) and destination address 192.168.2.20 (PC2's address). PC1 knows that PC2 is not on the local network, so it will hand this packet off to his default gateway, Router2. It does this by sending this IP packet with source MAC address his own MAC address and destination MAC address the address of Router2. Router2 will look up where to reach 192.168.2.20, which is through Router0. Router will replace the MAC addresses (source MAC: Router2, destination MAC Router0), but not change the IP addresses. Router0 will forward the packet the packet to Router1 in the same way as Router2 did. Finally, Router1 knows that the packet is local for him. So he forwards on the packet, which will end up having: 

In short: the destination IP is used to get the packet to the correct machine, the destination port is used to get the packet on that machine to the correct program/session The source IP is used to know where to send any replies. Same goes for source port. When a reply is sent, the source and destination are simply swapped. Let's start with two computers without any NAT: 

ARP requests are normally limited to one broadcast domain (one subnet if you like). So when host A knows (based on subnet mask) that host B is located in the same broadcast domain, it sends ARP directly to host B. With ARP host A determines B's mac and sends frame with MAC B and IP B. Otherwise it looks into IP routing table in order to determine nexthop for B's network if any. You probably have only one IPv4 route on your host - default one. So now host A should send IP packet with IP B and MAC of default gateway - that is how frame reaches IP nexthop. That is why ARP is being sent to DGW. P. S. I believe your question is off topic here. 

Generally all the devices at the AP communicate through AP. There are technologies as Wi-Di and Wi-Fi Direct, but those are beyond the scope of this question. So devices can't communicate directly in common Wi-Fi network. Regarding traffic interception, you should take into consideration ciphering here. Though there are ways to intercept traffic and read it contents, with WPA2 those attacks are very complicated. 

End to end VLAN or bridged connection through router L2TPv3 VXLAN OTV Older technologies such as Frame Relay more and more. 

MAC addresses aren't stored in RAM, but in TCAM. You can adjust the Resource Allocation of your TCAM by using a different SDM profile. The default is 6K unicast MAC addresses. The only profile that offers more space for is the VLAN profile, which offers 12K address, but reduces the number of routes you can use to 0. Having 6K MAC addresses is indicative of a different problem though. When you see that many MAC addresses on a switch, you might be looking at Layer 2 segments that are too large. When you have too many hosts in the same Layer two segment, you have a lot of overhead of all those chatty hosts. Also, if anything bad happens on the network, and there is no segmentation, everything will be affected. Also, seeing so many MAC addresses on the 3750X probably means that your network is very oversubscribed, making the 3750X a huge bottleneck. So, the better question to ask yourself first is: Why are there so many unicast MAC addresses on this switch, and how can this be reduced? 

R1 knows routes from R2 (Direct) and R5 (Direct) R2 knows routes of R1 (Direct), R3 (Direct), R4 (Reflected by R3) and R5 (Reflected by R1 and R3) R3 knows routes of R2 (Direct) and R4 (Direct) R4 knows routes of R3 (Direct) and R5 (Direct) R5 knows routes of R1 (Direct), R2 (Reflected by R1) and R4 (Direct) 

VPNv4 is the "transport". Your VRF route-targets match on both devices. Long story short, RT is extcommunity that is sent over VPNv4 session in BGP update. If one of local import RTs matches received extcommunity, routes are being imported in VRF with this RT configured. Actually VPNv4 is quite complex and complete explanation is beyond the scope of this site. VPNv4 is not required in order to run routing protocol inside VRF. Cisco calls it VRF-lite. Your problem with state here is related to routing. 

Tier X is formal reference. Traffic flows according to IP routing table. Basically you can access some resources without even leaving your provider's network. And some others require traffic to flow through several ISPs with different "tier". 

It may have different purposes. One of the most popular is to announce default route to customers with . Dropping all unknown destinations (e. g. RFC1918 subnets) in order to prevent traffic loops till TTL exceeds may also be a reason. 

There's bug with some line cards on this platform which leads to card crash when reboot occurs after long uptime. If this happens, the card is subject to RMA. Cisco can determine potentially risky cards by serial number. Best solution for you is to contact technical support and ask them. You should use specific version of software based on features you're using. Again, best advisor for you is Cisco. They can verify all potential bugs and recommend good variant for your needs.
