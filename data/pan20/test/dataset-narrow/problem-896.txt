I don't know whose instructions you were following, but either the instructions were wrong, or they were the wrong instructions. On a clean CentOS 7 system you can install Varnish 4 simply by: 

The nova help is a bit confusing, as it frequently uses the word "server" where "instance" is actually meant, and "host" where "compute node" is meant. OpenStack's terminology has changed over its history, and some of the terms used here are the historical old terms. So I experimented a bit to find out what these commands actually do. What I came up with is: Commands which operate on failed compute nodes: 

You have to use EAP/TLS. LEAP support was apparently removed from OS X with Lion. Follow the directions given by your network administrator. 

Well, they do sort of look like junk at first glance. Likely Gmail and Hotmail have seen so many of that sort of message that they automatically consider any similar messages junk. The first thing I would do is fix the mailing list software so that it's sending both HTML and plain text in the message. 

Those are just the obvious problems I see which will prevent the config from working at all. There are still plenty of other bad practices in here (such as improper use of ) which you should also clean up later. 

You can't "get rid of" these so easily. You're seeing this because other customers of your VPS provider are running Dropbox LAN sync. Personally I just drop traffic from other nodes in the same subnet without bothering to log it. For example, if your VPS's IP address is 203.0.113.148 and prefix 24: 

The reason this is happening is that the other domain name has the same IP address as yours. Since the last update to their DNS was in July of 2015, it appears that they simply have a defunct domain, and were the previous user of that IP address. This is easy to resolve: It appears that you've placed the configuration for your web site in the nginx default virtual host. This is not a recommended configuration. Your web site should have its own block, and the default block shipped with nginx should be left unchanged. To resolve the problem, restore the default block to what was shipped with nginx, and place the configuration for your web site in a separate block. In this way, accesses to any other domain directed at your IP address will be served the default nginx error page. 

It's dead, Jim. Replace the offending hardware. Of course, since you're using a low-end desktop motherboard (DEAR GOD WHY?) you might spend a moment testing whether the drive controller or cable has failed. 

The incompatibility that you ran into is this: The version of OpenSSL on RHEL5 (and its derivatives) doesn't advertise support for TLS at all. It only does SSLv3 and SSLv2. The version of OpenSSL on RHEL6 (and its derivatives) supports TLS all the way up to TLSv1.2. It also does SSLv3, but it wants to negotiate TLS. They should still be able to negotiate a session, as there is a (small) list of common ciphers to both of them, but depending on what you have selected for cipher settings on the server (e.g. to mitigate BEAST, eliminate low-security ciphers, etc.) there may not be any common ciphers that the client and server can use to communicate. The cipher suites for the server would be set in in your Tomcat or in Apache's if you have it sitting behind Apache. The client would use whatever it was configured to use, or otherwise. The resolution is to check the cipher suites on the server, e.g. with where STRING is whatever you configured on the server, and repeating the same on the client, and then adjusting one or both until a cipher suite is available that both will negotiate. 

Most likely you're missing the package. But why not save yourself all the trouble and just use a PPA for nginx? 

You're pretty close. But you need to match the trailing characters for and its corresponding . You also need to add a in that block to refer to the correct , which is probably . 

If you're running into a full connection tracking table, then simply enlarge it. Set the following in or a file which it includes: 

408 is Request Timeout. This means that the client connected but didn't actually send any data for a while, and the server gave up and dropped the connection with this error. This is also why nothing else was logged; no data was actually sent from the client. Apache's default timeout in this case is 300 seconds (5 minutes); it is configurable, but this generally shouldn't need to be changed. 

You can use the remi repository, which provides PHP 5.4 as well as MySQL 5.5 and some other LAMP related stuff not available with CentOS base or EPEL. If you use this repository, I strongly recommend the yum-versionlock plugin to ensure that your version of PHP remains on the 5.4 branch. 

Outgoing SMTP on port 25 is blocked by default for all Digital Ocean users. You'll need to contact them if you want it unblocked. 

You get an SSL protocol error because nginx is only serving HTTP on port 80, not HTTPS. But you mistyped https at the beginning of your URL. 

Second, look in the correct file. Your service is logging to but you have been looking at . Either look at the other file, or change the destination. 

This is a vulnerability where a malicious ssh server can attack the client if the client has connected with ssh-agent forwarding, and has somehow gotten a malicious file installed on the client's filesystem. I also think TrustWave has vastly overestimated the importance of this issue. That said, the obvious workaround is to disable agent forwarding in . 

The solution is to update the system. Red Hat did not ship virtio guest drivers until 5.3. At this point you're nine service packs behind. Simply having kept the system up to date would have resolved the problem before it ever happened.
