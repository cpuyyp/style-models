Did you set up Firefox to actually use Fiddler's proxy? In Advanced » Network » Connection » Settings, Firefox has several options for proxy settings: 

Not being able to select that "edit" link is caused by the layout in the web site, in combination with it being a clickable link, and in combination with the browser you're using. In Firefox and IE8, you can toggle "Caret Browsing" by hitting F7. This places a moveable cursor in web pages, allowing you to select text with the keyboard. But this is just a specific example. Other programs might have their own "smart" selection mechanism implemented. Like some word processors might always select whole words or never include spaces when selecting using a mouse. I am not aware of some operating system-specific behaviour. 

Assuming the SQL file was not created on that Mac, and depending on what you want to do with its data: just install the database software on that Mac, and import it into that new database? 

In the updated Resources tab, you will now see that your browser actually requests files like media.restorationhardware.com/is/image/rhis/prod1618051?$ev$ However, these are still not the full-size images as used in the Flash component. Using Wireshark, one can see that tiles are requested while scrolling or zooming. Like for $URL$ you will see tiles such as $URL$ being requested, and also meta data such as $URL$ You can also use , and change the values for and . The latter is two values for the top-left coordinate, and another two for the width and height (maximum sizes are returned when using ). Like gets you a tile for the upper-left corner. For the smaller the value, the higher the resolution. It seems that is not required. Still then, this is a lot of trial and error: 

Not an answer to your question, but especially when moving things from one server to another (like you kind of did when you installed Snow Leopard), or when taking things from a test machine to a production machine, I think you'll eventually love the configuration files. In the IIS management console there's all kind of settings on many different screens, or hidden behind some "Advanced" button. One cannot get an overview of all current settings. And even worse, with each new version of IIS (even with a Service Pack) a few defaults might change, which one will not notice unless going through all the screens and buttons. For Apache you can see and edit all settings in a few files. So, and I am not trying to be funny: a good text editor might be the best GUI you'll find! (I have written IIS configuration manuals that got outdated faster than I could create new screen captures; for Apache I'd just copy the relevant parts of some configuration files and that would be it.) 

Without knowing what kind of card you're using: often resetting is not possible. Once blocked, all access to the smart card is blocked, including any access that might be used to change the PIN. So I guess you need to find a way to register/associate another card with the same computer. (Providing more details on your system may help though.) 

(I assume the "Do you wish to debug" dialog is due to having some development tools installed. A regular Windows user is not prompted for that option.) 

Though you asked to find the BOM, using might even give you results when such BOM is not present. From : 

As for the IP address: things like whatismyip.com might help. You're using the ISP's DHCP, so you're getting multiple addresses from the ISP, which I doubt will be fixed then. Hence, what if your computer or AP is actually dropping the connection, or trying to use it after the "lease" has expired? Then "your" IP address can indeed be handed to someone else, and if the number of available addresses is limited then there's nothing new to connect to. So, do you still get a new IP address when this happens? Are you sure you did not manually set IP addresses somewhere? And what if you plugin one device into the LAN socket -- does the connection still drop if you wait a long time? You're saying: 

GoDaddy being the ISP, I assume you're using the GoDaddy SMTP server? If so, then to see if GoDaddy blocks it, or the hospital: send a message to yourself (to some GoDaddy hosted email address) using that connection. Any SMTP server must accept messages for its own subscribers, without any authentication. However, for non-GoDaddy recipients SMTP may be blocked with a reason of "Relaying denied" or something like that. If that message comes through, then you need to set up authentication for your SMTP server, to ensure GoDaddy knows it's one of their subscribers trying to use it. Without authentication, GoDaddy should not accept messages for non-GoDaddy recipients. If the message is not sent, then port 25 (or 465 for secure SMTP) is probably blocked by the hospital's firewall. Maybe GoDaddy supports alternative ports as a workaround for that. Often such alternative port is 587 ("message submission port"). Unlike ports 25 and 465, port 587 has been defined to always require some sort of authentication. As such, it is less prone to abuse for spam, and thus less likely to be filtered. Apple Mail automatically tries ports 25, 465 and 587, but for other email clients one might need to choose 587 manually. Of course, not all SMTP servers actually support port 587. Remember: when using port 587 then also set up authentication details as well! Of course, after fixing any port-issues, you may need to set up authentication after all (if that's not in place yet), to allow the SMTP server to relay messages to subscribers of other providers. 

(I like the Unicode BMP Fallback font, like used in Firefox, much better as it shows the exact 4-character Unicode code.) So, your Mac does not know what to display, and uses the Last Resort font to provide some information. My first guess was: Microsoft Office uses some proprietary symbol font, in which it uses character codes from the private use area (PUA) to define what the bullets look like. (Or maybe the author has some odd font installed from which some funny bullet has been used.) Your Mac neither knows that font, nor has any other font in which the same Unicode character code happens to be defined. And even if another font did define some character for that code, it would not help either, as characters from the private use areas may by definition have a totally different meaning in different fonts. Installing Office on the Mac might also include the font, probably making the bullets show fine in OpenOffice.org as well. (In fact, installing a trial of Office might already install the missing proprietary font.) Well, no. While the above would be true for any sane usage of Unicode, some further investigation learns that in old applications Microsoft uses the range U+F020..U+F0FF to display symbols using another font. When displaying characters from that range, it then automatically switches to another font for those characters. Some organisation named SIL International figured out: 

Above, a virtual folder maps all from to on the other IP address. To still keep using as the host, I added ProxyPreserveHost. All this will need the trailing slash; some standard rewriting could add that when needed: 

And likewise for the NTFS version? And are you sure there's no paths (references to directories) within that file? (And, sorry to ask: are you sure you actually copied the file, this being a hidden file on Unix? From Terminal, use something like , using to preserve the file dates and permissions, and without any to copy hidden files as well.) What if you ensure there's an error (just some typo suffices) in the file on your Mac? Do you get a 500 Internal Server error when going to some page then? (Just to determine if Apache is ignoring the altogether when the Virtual Host is configured to look at your Mac's partition, or is only ignoring parts of its contents then...) And are both sites in the same relative location of Apache's root? (Like versus for both, and not on your Mac, which could then have other files at some lower level)?
