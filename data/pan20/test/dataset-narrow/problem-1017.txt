I think I have found the problem. I changed the controller ID to 7 (from 6) and the HD only shows once now. However, it gets an ID of 6 for some reason (I was under the impression the default was 0, again it is unjumpered). I wouldn't mind it, but the windows 7 setup wouldn't load (hangs on the "Starting Windows" screen) and I suspect it has something to do with the ID not being 0 (it is purely a guess though) EDIT - OK, it seems the factory default for the Maxtor Atlas is indeed ID 6 so my problems with the win7 setup must reside elsewhere, possibly with the card itself (setup doesn't hange with the AHA-2940U2B) 

I would like to know whether after installed the Java Runtimes (JRE) on Windows, it is necessary for the webbrowser to keep the "lib" folder stored at: , or I can safely remove it after installation?...since this folders it seems to contain just source-code files if I'm not wrong. 

On the other hand, the trick works ok for the original items that are stored in the registry keys mentioned above, but this trick doesn't works for this "ghost" or "dummy" item which is the one that I want to hide from contextmenu. 

Scenario I'm using Windows 10, but I have the same problem In other Windows versions. I've added a custom item in my Windows contextmenu, it is intended to be accesible by right-clicking from a directory folder, or from a directory background. This registry script reproduces my custom contextmenu item (except the subcommands): 

TimeSnapper and Irfanview are nice, but they are missing a key feature: stop capturing when the computer is locked. It's pretty annoying to have thousands of screenshots of "Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to login". Using the free nircmd tool from Task Scheduler can resolve that. You need to create two tasks: Screen Capture Task 

A certain internet service I require demands that I connect from a university IP. Said service indeed works well when connected from several universities. Now, I would like to access that service at home and to that end, I have registered for a VPN account at my university. Connecting through the VPN account, I indeed get access to university resources such as libraries and university servers (which are not accessible otherwise). However, when accessing the service I need (which is not affiliated with my university specifically), my access is denied, since the IP appearing to that service is my regular ISP IP. Connecting to $URL$ confirms that (my regular IP/host is showing). Is there any way to use the VPN IP for all communication ? I'm using CheckPoint's SSL Network Extender for the VPN connection (not my choice, that's how their VPN site works). I'm also using my university's proxy, to no avail (same external IP). 

I am having troubles after installing VirtualBox with a BSOD on startup and was wondering how to view the minidump file that is created. 

Since I have upgraded to Windows 10 none of my chrome extensions are displaying popups when their icons are clicked and sometimes a small corner of the popup will display. I have discovered that when the window is on my main screen that the popups work fine (I have a 3 monitor setup). I have tried many versions of Chrome and Chrome canary, 32 and 64 bit and all have this problem. I have also tried changing various GPU related flags but have had no luck with this either. My video card is a GTX590 and as this is a dual GPU card it may explain why the popups are only seen on the monitor connected to GPU A and not the others. 

Perform a restoration point, otherwise open the command prompt (CMD.exe) and run these orders to make a backup of the service key tree: 

Question How I could disable my contextmenu item from still appearing on the contextmenu of the desktop background?. Please note that its a simple contextmenu item manually added via registry, I don't pretend to rework the implementation via shell extension. 

Research I tested a lot of 3rd party applications but any of them has convinced me, because all has very bad inconvenients. I know ShellFolderFix, which can be downloaded here: $URL$ ... But ShellFolderFix its more a troublemaker than a fix, because it has a annonying bug that causes the current Explorer window to "randomly" move over the screen. I describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it here: $URL$ Then, ShellFolderFix or other window managers are not an option for me, I'm asking for a proper solution that does not involves the usage in background of those kind of applications. Update I heard that the build 10525 of Windows 10, which seems it was released on 12/October/2015, it fixes the cascade view. However, it is an Insider Preview and I cannot find the ISO in my native language, in Spanish. 

The 12noon tool looks nice, but barring an official MS tool, I'll take NirSoft over any other tool any day. Shameless plug: You may be interested in the TvGameLauncher tool I wrote for exactly this purpose (switching primary displays for playing games). It can also switch to HDMI audio and prevent the screensaver from popping up while you're playing (without disabling it). It even supports the Steam protocol () so you don't have to use the trick. It doesn't support disabling your other monitors though, but I'll add that to my todo list (I have some other cool features coming up like automatic TV shortcut generation). Edit - all features added. Check it out! 

It is a shareware app, but sincerelly is the most complete choice and is not a high-price product, anyways If I remember good the trial mode has no expiration, only feature limitations. 

That GUID or CLSID does not exists on the registry of my host OS (Windows 8), seems that is only for Windows 8.1, and I did not find any info about that GUID 'cause Google just finds two matches from Technet in an unknown language for me: $URL$ These are the unique keys that exists on my registry referencing that CLSID: ( Maybe you could notice and advise me of important differences from an original Windows 8.1 fresh installation) 

SocketSniff allows you to watch the Windows Sockets (WinSock) activity of the selected process. On x64 version of Windows, SocketSniff can only work with 32-bit programs. Is there any SocketSniff equivalent that works for 64-bit processes ? I prefer it to WireShark because it filters per process, and it intercepts the messages before they even get to the socket (or at least, as they are getting to it) 

It's not perfect because if you have running in the background for other reasons, the "Stop on Unlock" task might kill it instead, but I reckon this won't be the case for the vast majority of users. 

There is a way via a CLI or GUI application to grant Admin rights to ALL the keys/Values of an entire registry Hive (like System, SAM, ntuser.dat, etc)? The problem is that I'm using the tool provided by Microsoft to service and deploy Windows, I'm trying to perform some operations that removes pre-installed packages from a WIM image that I've previouslly mounted, I'm able to remove few packages but for most of them reports me that I have access denied to touch the Hives, so I suppose that to properlly remove some packages Dism needs to update or delete keys from the WIM Hives, then I need to grant Admin rights to those keys! I normally use application to grant Admin rights on a single or multiple keys/values of the local Registry, but for a Hive I don't have idea how to. PS: I've wasted days trying to investigate and search for information but by the moment I didn't find ANY existing information related to how to perform this operation, why?, why there is no (or at least not easy to found) information about this kind of operation over all the World Wide Web?, I'm miss understanding the real problem or doing something wrong?. This is the command that I'm using: 

I have recently installed VirtualBox, then after restarting my PC on startup it blue screens. I started it in safe mode with the intention of uninstalling VirtualBox but am met with the error when uninstalling "the mobile installer service is unavailable in safe mode." When starting in safe mode with networking i get a blue screen so I am assuming it is to do with network drivers. 

I am developing a site using Node.js and MongoDB, both of which are run from the Windows Command Prompt. Occasionally one or both of the programs freezes (no output to console, not accepting incoming connections etc.) often within a few seconds of starting up. Typing any key into the console will unfreeze it and it seems to resume where it left off (connections will complete and any output will be printed). Note: This is not a problem with my program, in no place do I wait for any keyboard input and it seems to occur fairly randomly, not in a fixed place. 

This is a brief introduction for those who don't know the next information: The new Windows 10's flat window style uses a different window-border mechanism than previous Windows versions, which affects in a horrible way the window aspect, and its usage, in the meanning of window-resizing and window-positioning. Windows 10 by default has a 1 px. visible border, notice the word "visible", because the reality is that the border width is greater, simply is just an invisible border, that is, the border image resource that Windows 10 uses it only fills 1 px. of the real width of the window border bounds, no matter how big is the border width, you always will only see 1 px. border, and here you can imagine by yourself the problem that can cause. In Windows 10, as in previous Windows versions, you can perform some registry changes to increase the window borders width, this is an example of what I mean, for Windows 8:
