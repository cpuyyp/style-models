It is important for these sources to reference specific versions of linux distributions. An example is trusty which is the codename for Ubuntu 14.04. You can query your OS (debian based) for complete details with or which means short and codename. In your question, the part is interpreted and the result from your operating system is printed into the custom source file ros-latest.list which the command will create upon execution. 

Command language interpreter The command is the bourne shell. This is one, among several shells but is considered the old standard and generally one you can be certain exist. It's also common to see in many shell scripts. That declaration is specifying the shell to use as different shells use different syntax. As regards the flag, quoting : 

You could probably use .netrc file (note: I havent't done this myself). You could either generate dynamically at runtime or have it sit there. EDIT: As long as your script has access to .netrc, so does the user that runs the script. So if you give the script to someone else and that someone else has access to the private key, it doesn't matter that you don't have the password hard-coded in the script. 

Let me add one more possibility here for future reference. If you are using the microSD card with full-size SD adapter, the adapter may be bad. This is especially common with cheaper cards, and these adapters may go bad pretty quickly too. (In my experience as little as 10 uses in the worst case.) The most reliable way to tell if the card is still good is to use a dedicated microSD reader, possibly a higher-quality one. A mobile phone that takes microSD card can also be used. I generally recommend using microSD readers for microSD cards. 

My employer in the US has asked me to obtain a static IP address to enable him lock down his servers to the general public, allowing just our IP addresses. The cost of obtaining an IP address here is alarming (over $600 USD). He's suggested that I setup a VPN or some other system to mask my public IP with a static one. I own quite a few devices that I connect to the internet. Can I setup a VPN at home or on a rented server and connect to the internet using the VPN network? Will doing this give me a permanent IP address? What options do I have? 

This did not produce the result I expected. Is what I'm trying generally a good approach? How do I make this work? EDIT: Added diagram kindly provided by Cont7e 

With the above two lines in sudoers (you can edit the suoders with command), user account named will be able to run without password: 

The identifies the value set by JavaScript on the page you are on. If you believe does something relevant, you can try removing it by running the following: 

Apart from dig, no other tool (ping, curl, etc) will actually use the address, but instead they all complain that the hostname could not be resolved. What am I doing wrong and is this approach good? 

Everything within the is read as a string, you wouldn't need to figure out how to escape various quotation marks or worry about the shell interpreting something the wrong way. 

I have the Huawei B5142 device from my carrier. This device is the source of internet connection to my home's router. My PS4 is wirelessly connected directly to the Huawei device, bypassing my router. The Huawei device has a public IP address such as 196.210.3.4, and an internal address such as 10.15.3.11, my PS4 has a traditional 192.168.1.50 address which is static. I should note that my ISP currently uses NAT444 / LSN (Large Scale NAT), however the public and router internal addresses (196.210.3.4 and 10.15.3.11) are static allocations from my ISP's network. I have de-activated the router's built-in firewall and DMZ'd my PS4's internal address (192.168.1.50), yet I still get a moderate (Type 2) NAT result. Is there something else I can try or is an open NAT type even possible behind CGN? 

If your drive is failing as per Omar's suggestion, you should get another drive that is larger than the failing one (larger than 320GB + the size of the data you currently have on it) and burn a copy of SystemRescueCD or similar rescue system, and use a tool like ddrescue to copy the failing drive to the other one. It will generate an image file that you can later mount and copy files to the remaining space on the new larger drive. 

will not be available to the user for anything else, though, with or without password, unless there are other entries in sudoers list that permit it. 

Package Management and Software Repositories Debian based Linux distributions rely on repositories (databases of application installation packages and upgrade packages) to keep the operating systems updated and also to easily fetch and install new software packages. The location of these repositories are stored in , however additional sources, usually unique to specific applications can be stored in the directory. When the package index update command is executed, your operating system checks with these package repositories for available packages and registers the available softwares as available to your operating system which you can go on to install using the traditional command. An example of one of these software sources is: 

If you fancy using Linux, most distributions can be installed and booted off removable storage including external drives and SD cards. You could set aside a small partition on the external drive that is used for the Liunux OS, and then keep the rest as a FAT/NTFS filesystem. You will also need a tool on the Windows 7 machine that would synchronize the contents of the FAT/NTFS filesystem with a local directory. A tool like rsync is ideal, but not sure if one can be found for Windows. If you can't find it, another option is to run rsync from within the Linux OS on the external drive: boot it, sync the folders, and then boot Windows. Unless the files you are working on are large, I would suggest using an SD card instead of an external hard drive. It may not boot on some PCs, however, so you should first check. SD cards are far more robust than hard drives and there are large SD cards on market now that aren't too expensive (32GB should suffice for most purposes unless you are doing video or photo work). Booting from SD cards is also somewhat faster. 

I have scoured the web and tried numerous solutions. Nothing has worked for me so far, hence this question. I have a rails application that I run with . That command has to be run from the directory of the application, in this case "/var/myapp". This is the setup: /etc/mongrel.sh 

I added this () before in /etc/rc.local The above does NOT work, but it does work when run manually . I have also tried running this in a screen session using: . Any suggestions to get this working as desired? I need this application running after boot.
