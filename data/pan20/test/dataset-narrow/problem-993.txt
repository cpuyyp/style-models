Try nano and pico. IIRC, they don't mess with the contents of your session. They are also way simpler. If you don't need to edit and only want to output the files, then you just need 'cat filename' and it won't even leave your shell to create any fullscreen viewer environment such as your experience with vi 

This is always a hard one. Try using your MacOS X CD to run Disk Utility and check / repair the disk. This and other steps are described here at the official Apple faq. The problem is they don't guarantee much. If holding the Option Key only lists the Windows partition, then there's no other choice but to fix the problem so that the macbook can again "see" the Mac partition (and if so, you'd be unlikely to continue having the problem.) On second thought, if following the above steps from Apple yields no solution, your last resort is to try Disk Utility anyway, to wipe the whole disk and start freshly. BUT...that will kill your Windows install too. However, it should be straight forward. 

Save the file. Applying the change everywhere and immediately is simplest if you just log out and then log back in. 

Routing through Tor using a local DNS proxy such as TorDNS and Privoxy works on all major OS's. However, even without sending all web traffic through Tor, there are problems such as difficulty using Google, for example. Besides, there is a chance that popular Tor exit nodes might be subject to DNS hijacking, invalidating all our efforts. What popular nodes should be avoided? 

Good call on burning your CD. If your machine even HAS USB ports, you can't really use USB sticks because seamless support was added after Windows 98. At a minimumm, tools aware of legacy needs demand at least Windows 98. It doesn't matter what your version of Windows is: serious antivirus freeware will not even need you to run windows and install it. Instead, many boot CD's you boot from the CD and run it independently of any Windows version. As a nice perk, the tools aren't blinded by any intentional potential rootkits inside your infected system. In spite of this, my experience with a Windows 98 install years ago was that antispyware tools couldn't fully clean it, probably because of fewer testers. Good luck 

Now that the configuration is in place, from the other two comments, Pacerier just needs to open the files from the windows side. That can be easier than needing to know the IP addresses. You can open My Computer and on the left-hand pane click on Network or Network Places (quick guide here)". If you only see a "Windows Network" item on XP, then just open it and dig around. Ignore Microsoft's simplification of realities for Windows XP, since we know it's really a Mac that you'll find there. Beware that there's no hint on Windows XP that it will present a password prompt at the moment you do try to access shared files from another windows or Mac computer. If you're more familiar with macs than windows, don't be surprised that Windows-to-Windows setup dialogs for Shares say little on what your share's password will be. However, your mac will clearly demand a share password during the SMB share procedure in System Preferences. That password is independent of your login passwords on the mac. 

Programs have different ways of handling arguments, so a few will have some equivalent of -folder=name option. Beyond that exception, the standard, even on MS DOS, is simply $ program subdir Sometimes you need $ program subdir/ The program will open the folder, work with it the same way you work with a file, and once finished, return control to your shell, which is pointed at your original standard directory. Programs handled this way DO have the issue that error outputs (like core dumps) go to a file in your shell's current directory (rather than subdir.) There is no workaround unless the program has command switches available to specify a different place. Some programmers take artistic license between "directory program was called from" and "directory program was told to work in ." 

This is not something I've tried yet, so I can't help specifically. You're running uphill by choosing formats that rarely appear out there; USB is what unetbootin thrives in. Anyway, I found a wiki for Thinkpad / Windows CF booting. You might learn a thing or two about 10k and 100k-write durability designs, general tuning tips and even the fixed disk / removable disk issues that can translate to your purposes. The hardest part is probably going to be ensuring that current USB tools like unetbooting read your CF card. Next hardest will probably be even finding motherboards trying to even offer booting for CF. When manufacturers fail to provide a standard and users fail to demand one (I think that's how el-torito bootable CD's and even bootable USB support came about). Your request sounds like a roll-your-own solution kind-of thing, which is hard to do unless you're a hardware hacker with means to solder things together and program new logic into chips. Good luck! 

The Windows command line uses start programname and start filename.ext to process the file as if the user had double-clicked it in the GUI shells we all know and love. MacOS's command line does the same with open. That is useful for those of us who don't know the exact program and location for opening unusual file types. On Linux, ./filename.ext is to run scripts, and start filename.ext responds with an error because it's expecting a "job". So... What is the standard CLI command to open a non-script file under whatever the registered type-handler under Linux? If it's not standard, what does Red Hat use? 

You hit the nail on the head via the thumbnail creation symptom of this illness. You're probably not going to fix the problem unless you remove the one OS enhancement filter that K-Lite uses to create previews (or watever your codec-pack of choice is.) That some movies use different compression schemes can mean the erratic differences in slowdowns, and you've already noticed that different systems are now really nosy and can't just copy files and move files without slowing down to take a peek at them "usefully", to our general detriment. I think there's also an Ff-mpeg or similar-sounding tool that automatically comes up on your system tray when you're decoding the movies, which includes doing some reading for explorer previews / thumbnails and metadata so that Windows can "helpfully" tell you about movie duration without double-clicking on it. Again, Mkv files under windows are installed in your codec pack, so look in your start menu, run its config or setup.exe tool again and try to look for the option on filters (or even Add-Remove Programs and features control panel). You'll probably have no granular option to "remove" only MKV's filters, so perhaps you'll need to disable movie thumbnails for mp4 and other nifty filetypes. I was lite on the details, so here's a google search, and one place where there's one thumbnail config tool, though it could conflict with your MKV pack already installed. Use at your own rick. Good luck 

Nothing I can think of, even beyond ebooks on the world of fullscreen PC's. Your fallback is to use the readers' find command with whatever unique sentence you were last reading, making sure you typed it verbatim before pressing < ENTER > 

A mute button can be tampered with easily. The best software solution to your problem is to manually disable your sound device in the Device manager. The downside is that you'll not remember how to undo this when someone wants to figure out how to make your speakers work a few months later so they can show you a funny video. 

Good. I did that too. Click on Start, then "Run". Type services.msc. Enter password if necessary on Vista or later. On the Name column, find "Google Updater Service" or similar. Right click it and open Properties. For Startup Type, change it to Disabled. You may click on the Stop button as well. OK and exit all the windws and you're done. If you want to ever update some day, follow the steps, set the startup back to Automatic, reboot AND Google Chrome will update the next time it is run. 

Do you smell anything burning behind your power supply? I had to replace mine to fix unexplained reboots that hit me about 2 minutes into a cold bootup for my old Dell dimension. And speaking of burning, check that your capacitors aren't leaking or bulging. A few years ago this used to be very common. Computers that randomly power off usually have an un-fixable motherboard issue, or a newly manifested heating problem. You aren't going into detail about your headline of "runs only on its side." It could be that you are taking the "lid" off and only see it run stably the moment that air circulates freely and keeps the PC much colder than when you stand it up and set the airflow back to normal conditions. You might need to get a whole new PC, though. The final test of truth is to see if active use of a different operating system still suffers from the same powerdowns (downloaded Ubuntu LiveCD or LiveUSB). If it doesn't, it could be some updated driver that will require you reinstall your whole Windows rig. 

My main PC, an 8-year old Dimension 2350, started powering down randomly today (as in monitor says "no signal" and all power is cut, and NOT the progressive Windows shutdown that happens you mistakenly push the power button.) I'll be looking for obvious issues like loose connections and capacitor bulges/leaks. I think there was a very slight burn smell from the power supply a few days ago, though there's none today and the PC has zero issues turning back on. It will run for 1 to 3 minutes before shutting off and it's supposedly slow, but I couldn't immediatly check what threw it to 100% usage without elevating the Taskmgr. I replaced the previous power supply 3 years ago due to a less hidden smell AND reboots. I recently noticed prominent lint covering some vents and hadn't bothered fix them then --that DOES increase the CPU temperatures and cause shutdowns AFAIK (Pentium 4 @1.7Ghz by the way). I should run Prime95 stability tests as well. It doesn't have more than the stock heatsink/fan combo for normal cooling and there are no CPU temperature sensors to confirm whether overheating is a problem, but it's been OK at that spot of the house for 3 years. I haven't checked the PCI nVidia card's sensor today but know that particular part is about 50 Celsius on idle and 70 under heavy loads. The card is an 8400GS and the PSU is 350 Watts. The former PSU was rated ~100 Watts back when I had an older nVidia card, so the card should not be choking the power distribution --nothing is even running in 3D when it dies, and heavy 3D games/screensavers haven't been a problem before. The PC also powered down while I was spying BIOS settings and another time while booting Linux, so I know it's not XP's fault for once and unplugged it till I start checking. I see no "thermal events" nor anything else in the BIOS. What else might I check? can I finally justify building a custom PC? Thanks 

My laptop with Ubuntu 9.04 and 10 did the same thing in one upgrade. They just screwed up and mislabeled Vista as "Recovery environment." Give it a try and it will boot fine! If you wanna rename it, you'll have to look around in your /boot subfolder for menu.lst from Ubuntu. Then, use a more precise name and be careful not to change anything other than the title. 

My application development team wants to test program builds on older MacOS X versions (10.4 and 10.5). Is there an emulator or virtual system capable of allowing this from inside our MacOS 10.6? I've found that VMWare, VirtualPC and SheepShaver are Windows only solutions, and probably don't even emulate MacOS 10.0. What about vMac, PearPC and MacOnMac? Do we need all the older MacOS X install CD's or does the emu software take care of faking out a base OS? 

Gives one account name for every user removed from the system, in this format. It doesn't matter how long ago it was removed as long as the com.apple.preferences.accounts.plist file itself is not tampered with: 

What bash version number came with that original release? 10.4.11 shows me more or less I tested it on my MacOS 10.4.11 and since I saw the 2.05b vrsion, I kinda freaked out since it's very old even for 10.4.11... 10.4.0 is likely sub 2.0. Is my script backward compatible with 10.4.0? Someone here will probably throw it into a ppc virtual machine or something. It doesn't have to be exactly 10.4.0, but closer is better. I can't tell if Apple's documentation is correct but it has the exact version number in the online manpages :) 

In my case the modem's lights are hiding or set off to one side. Even when they're in front of me, it is harder to know that PPP is temporarily down because the modem just turns off one green indicator in a row of 4 or 5 other equal green indicators.
