The SMBv2 flaw is discussed in this security bulletin from Microsoft. The flaw was thought to allow an attacker to crash any Windows Vista computer(and pre-release versions of Windows 7) over a network. It has since been proven to allow the attacker to take over and install malware onto your PC. SMBv2 is used to share printers and files between computers. Microsoft has not yet released a patch to fix this vulnerability, they currently recommend disabling this service. You can safely disable this service and use SMBv1 and maintain network sharing, although it may be somewhat slower. Microsoft has released an easy “Fix It” to disable the service for you. You are vulnerable if you are running these operating systems: 

It should be noted that due to licensing issues, the Linux ZFS implementation is somewhat crippled. It runs as a Userspace program, and has dramatically reduced performance, and iirc, a reduced feature set. Solaris and FreeBSD are the recommended OS choices, although Mac OSX has limited support. Followup - The OSX port of ZFS has since become somewhat deprecated, I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than testing 

You are not vulnerable if you are running these operating systems: Any of the above systems with SMBv2 turned off. 

The majority of the team has left since the oft-cited ZFS project at macosxforge.org shut down. Check here for the "refugees" and latest code, although it's clearly not well supported. 

In Firefox Firebug, under the tab, there is an option called "Disable Cache". I flip this on when doing redirect testing, and I have it flipped off otherwise. 

When I unplug a device, or plug a new one in, windows plays a specific alert sound. Is there a way to make windows display a popup notification showing the name of the device, in addition to the alert sound? Using Windows 7, would prefer a built-in method but a 3rd party utility is totally fine if it can accomplish it. 

So it appears to run the command, but I am still in my home directory! I must be missing something really simple here. How can I get this tiny script to actually cd the directory in powershell? 

As far as I know I have the latest version of flash (I updated a couple days ago). For at least the last month I have noticed flash using far too much ram (between 200 and 500 MB). I notice it because my computer will stutter, and then it will resume fine after killing Flash's process. Its typically caused by a popunder ad with a lot of flash on it. Right now, it has spiked out of control. It is using 2 gigs of RAM. I have 7 tabs open and no popunders. It used to be that upgrading flash would fix this type of error, but it hasn't. I have to kill flash it seems like almost every half hour during a normal browsing session. Has anyone else seen a spike in Flash's usage? I have a decent machine (8 gb of ram, Samsung 840 SSD, and Intel 3840QM@2.7Ghz) and this makes firefox unusable and also slows down other programs. Is there a permanent solution to prevent flash from monopolizing my system during an average, modest browsing session? 

A big obvious solution to many of the problems, is going with 802.11n, of course. By using the 5ghz mode, you increase bandwidth, and reduce interference with a sizeable number of other devices, such as cordless phones or other (apartment) access points. Simply by switching my airport from 2.4ghz to 5ghz mode, I notice a huge difference. So in summary, going with a less populated frequency and/or channel is often a huge boost to throughput in a noisy area. 

If you are interested in a little bit of self-exploration, consult with your teacher about using XCode or gcc tools. With a few exceptions and side-cases, C++ is C++ whether on windows, mac, unix, linux, etc. Visual Studio is one environment to code in, but far from the only one. The source code you create should be fully compatible with Visual Studio. Note: This doesn't necessarily apply if you are doing GUI development or Graphics programming. Both of those require access to OS system libraries. In any of these cases, a wine-type virtualization won't work either, you'll need an actual Windows install. 

I have read about a new security flaw in Windows Vista and SMBv2. What is it and how does it affect me? What is SMBv2? 

Try ffmpeg. It's a ridiculously powerful commandline tool that'd be great for this. Split the mp3 using the short guide here and add the switch to adjust volume. For more info on ffmpeg switches, go to this guide and check out the FFmpeg homepage. A massive chunk of the commercial, freeware, and opensource audio/visual tools use ffmpeg under the hood for all of their transcoding and av work, give it a shot! 

I have a 5TB external NTFS drive thats nearly full. It was exhibiting an odd behavior: I would copy a file to it, the total space free would adjust accordingly, but the file was nowhere to be found. So I ran check disk on it (from the Windows 7 UI, not the command line) on it and the check disk seemed to get stuck (The file number that it was working on did not change for over 36 hours), so I cancelled the check. Now, the drive is unreadable. It is recognized in device manager, and in it is shown as an unallocated drive, and it prompts to me allow disk management to initialize it with MBR or GPT. So, at least the drive isn't broken. How can I recover the data? 

When I type in into the address bar It used to autocomplete/autofill to but now it autocompletes to the slack page. This is actually very frustrating since I hit that domain a zillion times a day and very rarely intend to hit the slack domain. Is there anyway to have FF default autocomplete to the plain domain without having to purge the slack domain from my history? 

Why? I have an old flip phone and that is the only audio format it understands for non-midi ringtones. I realize that dedicated software exists to do this but it would be great if I could do it with ffmpeg since I use that for many other conversions as well. 

UPDATE: I ordered an HDMI to DisplayPort converter, and it worked OK but had quite a few problems: slow refresh rate, laggy cursor, didn't work well with my KVM switch when rebooting, etc. So I bought a new DisplayPort video card for $70 and all problems went away: KVM shows video at reboot, cursor looks normal, I'm getting 60Hz refresh rate @ 4K, and to top it off the new card uses 5 less watts ($1 per month less electricity!). So if I had to do it over again I wouldn't have bothered with converters-- instead I'd have just bought a new low-end video card. 

I want to end up with a "clustered column" chart which shows, for each product family, the percentage of products in that family which are "Safe for Kids", "Under $10", or have "Free Shipping". Each product family should have three bars each, one for each percentage. It's easy to do this for absolute values by using a in my PivotChart for each column. But I can't figure out how to turn those sums into percentages of the total number of rows in each category. Any ideas? 

After learning more than I ever wanted to about video cables and standards, here's what's going on. First off, video adapters and cables are not always bidirectional. An inexpensive "HDMI-to-Mini-DisplayPort" cable is designed to convert from a Mini-DP output to an HDMI input. But if you want to go the other way, from an HDMI output (like an older video card) to a DisplayPort input (like a monitor or KVM switch) then you need a much-more-expensive "converter" like one of these. The same goes for other kinds of conversions. Some conversions can be accomplished with simple "passive" (no computer chips) cables or adapters while other conversions require "active" converters that run the signals through electronics. And apparently those active conversion electronics are more complicated and therefore expensive in both money and electrical power. Here's my understanding of the rules: 

When I have my Samsung Galaxy 8 plugged into my computer, and I drag an .m4a file to it, it prompts if I want to just copy the file, or "convert and copy" the file since it thinks my MTP device may not be capable of playing an m4a. So I say yes, expecting an mp3, but I get an even less useful .wma file instead. How can I change the convert and copy to covert to mp3 instead of wma? See this related question which seeks to disable the dialog entirely. Disable prompt to convert videos copied to media device 

Since yesterday I am getting constant notifications of threats Symantec is finding, except they are all in the quarantine folder. They are then "moved" to the quarantine folder, and then again I get notifications about the same threats. Is it safe to delete my quarantine folder? Moreover, is something seriously wrong with my machine? Using Windows 7 SP1, Symantec Endpoint Protection 12.1.2015.2015.105 

I have no idea what this means. For all customer's who want to install the latest operating system. I already installed Windows, I don't plan on installing a newer version on top of it...? Can you explain what this update actually does? Using Windows 7 SP1 

So, this may seem like a stupid question, but are all of the components on the exposed circuit board on a hard drive necessary? I ask this because of a weird situation I had with a hard drive. I got a used 360GB sata1 3.5inch Seagate drive from a friend. He was scrapping an old tower for parts, and he sold me the hard drive. One day, I had the drive hooked up to a Sata to USB adapter so I could format it. While it was connected, smoke started emanating from the board. Since I didn't have a technician on call, and I was not particularly invested in the well being of the hard drive, I did what seemed like a sensible thing at the time: I took a Flathead screwdriver, and pried off the part that was smoking. It was a little black square. After doing that, the hard drive stopped smoking, and actually continued to work. 4 years later, the drive is still going strong in an HTPC I made for my parents. I was under the impression that a circuit board was like a closed system, and frying/destroying any part of the board would destroy the whole thing. But that is clearly not the case here. How is that possible? Are not all of the components neccesary for the drive to function? Is my drive now operating in some diminished capacity, or is the loss of the smoking part completely inconsequential?
