Try /opt or /usr or /usr/local All of those are good choices. As mentioned below in a comment by @Journeyman Geek using the /usr/local location is a generally accepted practice. 

I installed Ubuntu, Windows 7x32, Windows 7x64, and OS X 10.4 on a previous machine, and on my current one I am dual booting OS X 10.9 and Windows 8.1. I installed them using rEFIt (I never upgraded to rEFInd but it did work flawlessly-- and I cannot imagine rEFInd would work worse than its predecessor... If I reboot with extra drives attached -- USB ports, it finds those as well on boot.) I always tend to partition in advance with with either the Mac Disk Utility or gparted. You will have the best luck installing windows first-- less hassles. 

Modern versions of Ubuntu claim to have multiple monitor support. Doing a quick search on the net I do see many different sites devoted to how to set them up for different graphics display or hardware settings. Ubuntu does in fact have a lot of support and updates often. 

Function keys are not part of standard typing (but a later add-on for computer users), nor are they really standard and only used for special rare circumstances that do not occur in regular typing. So you are correct, it is personal preference. 

I have been using converters and combined cables (all of the above) back and forth (for computer monitors and for televisions) -- they work very effectively. The real difference is that the HDMI cables can include audio, but DVI cannot so connecting the two will filter out audio to the DVI end. One piece of advice however, don't get extremely long HDMI cables as the signal only goes so far and you will need to also purchase a signal booster if you do. 

Yep, its just like chrisF said, Here is a KB article from microsoft explaining it as well and Here is a KB article explaining what a DLL is. Think of them as library files for programs on your computer. They hold instructions on how to do different things for different programs. When you register it you are telling your computer that you have these instructions, where there at and programs that say they need them can use them now. 

Your easiest option to display messages to users connecting to your Wireless network will be through setting up a captive portal. You will redirect the users HTTP request, whatever it is and force them to go to a page of your choosing instead. Usually, they will have to stay on this page until they authenticate (login, click accept, etc). This will force every user to see your message. The easiest way to setup a basic, Welcome to my Wifi, type message would be to purchase an Access Point or Router that has this ability built in. You can set this up manually, but that will be more involved. If you would like to go that route let us know and I can post some information to get you started. 

First thing that I would do is to go to the computer that it does not work on, run each command from cmd.exe one after another and see which step does not complete its task like it should. Once we can narrow it down to which step is having problems it might be easier to find out what is going wrong on that machine. If everything works fine when you manually run each command then I would guess that one of the variables is not setting itself correctly on the other machine. 

In the Control Panel, double-click Network and Internet, then Network and Sharing Center.. In the Network and Sharing Center (under Tasks on the left), select Set up a connection or network. Choose the connection option Set up a wireless ad hoc (computer-to-computer) network, then click Next. Read the description and warnings about ad hoc networks, then click Next>. Enter details, including Network name (the SSID for your ad hoc connection), Security type, and SecurityPassphrase. If you are going to save this network connection, check Save this network. Make a note of the SSID and the Security key/ Passphrase for future reference. Click Next Continue to follow the prompts to complete setup of the ad hoc network connection.

NOTE: the answers proposed are for Windows Server 2003. Even the one claiming Windows 7 posted in 2012 appears to fail in 2014. I have tried them and they do not work for Windows 7. This question has not been answered yet. If you have not tested in Windows 7, please do not post an answer. The answers given are not for this version of windows and are not compatible. That said I do appreciate the suggestions... I have a Windows 7 machine that needs to have a fresh boot weekly. This part works fine. The issue is that Google Drive needs to be accessible even if I have not logged into the box. It is attached to a user account so the act of logging in enables it. Is there a way to have the system log into Google Drive on its own at boot time? I attempted to have Windows 7 boot into a specified account on its own, but it did not activate the drive. The option to start with the computer was chosen, it did not start with the computer but with the account, meaning a username and password is still required to be manually entered. [I am using 32-bit Windows 7 Professional, Service Pack 1] UPDATE: I am going to attempt a different method of syncing files instead of google drive, it may be possible that the 'server' solutions do not equate to Windows 7 deployment. (EG: this question may not have a working answer, or one has not been found yet.) 

Well if you are just looking for a cheap way to add an extra monitor and you can not or do not want to purchase a new video card you can always look at some of these USB video cards. The drivers for most that I have seen are only for windows systems and the cards will not be as powerful, but if you are looking for a cheap easy way to add an extra monitor, it is another option besides adding another internal video card. 

Is the problem that you are not getting an IP over wireless? If you set a static IP on your device within that network you can still contact the router? Also do you mean all interfaces besides the WAN port are bridged together? It sounds like DHCPD is not broadcasting over the bridge you setup (probably br0). From the webpage you could go to setup, networking, multiple dhcpd servers, click add and create one and choose its interface to be br0. Also you might want to go to setup, vlans and scroll to the bottom of that page and make sure the wireless box is set to LAN. I think from the web-gui this puts the radio on the LAN bridge. 

As far as I am aware you will not accomplish this without a little bit of programming or finding a custom app that someone else has created to do this. $URL$ contains information on a command line utility that will allow you to create a shortcut to do what you are looking for In particular look on the blog where they go into detail regarding the following options: They give you examples on how to make a shortcut to call the program using the above parameters to do exactly what you are after. As I've not tried this before I'm not sure how well it works, but if you are having some trouble with the scripting program I am sure myself or others would be able to help. Incase something happens to the above blog, the location of the actual utility is here $URL$ 

Most of the time people use wordpad or notepad (which can be executed from the prompt) but you could use third party tools. 

This is possible directly... it is called an ad-hoc network (networking a device directly without a router) 

Delete the lines in your passwd and shadow files in your /etc directory manually first. You can then rm -fR the home directory for that user account. (m in your example) Additional files will still have to be removed. For example: /var/spool/mail/m This is a very surgical approach to use when userdel refuses to work. 

You would have to remote into a separate proxy machine, and then from there remote into the one you intend to target, effectively spoofing the original ip by hiding behind the proxy. 

You can't. The web page is not the only part of this application. There is a back-end program creating the images that it generates that is not available to download. A server program that creates images like this on the back end is ImageMagick. You would have to have the front page form (which you have via downloading) - a back end form processing program (written in PHP or other server language) that uses ImageMagick to create the image and post it on the web for download. 

Adobe Acrobat does that. Give it a URL, tell it to stay on the same server. There is a free trial if you don't want to spend the money, or if you just need to do it once. You can see a tutorial on how to do that here: $URL$ 

You can most probably use panorama stitching software. I have used Hugin many times with absolutely fabulous results (to the point that I nowadays always take suitable panorama pictures when I'm at somewhat of a lookout :-) ) using a lot more complex images than what your are describing. It also gives you fine-tuned control over "horizon lines" and such (and compensates for skewed perspective, which should not be needed in your case). There are probably many more alternatives as well. Compared to Adobe Photoshop, one obvious (and for some, giant) advantage is that you don't have to shell out $700 for a copy, since Hugin is free, cross platform and open source. 

in descending order. Not all steps are applicable in every case. In these times the web is often a preferred shortcut if one has the possibility, though. gives me that turns out to be related to . More documentation could then be hunted with that new information. The Debian manual indicates that is the best way. It also mentions which works similarly, but only on installed packages (which is OK in this case, but has a large general use, and I'd recommend to have it in handy anyway). 

Don't "blindly" run commands if you do not understand each part of them. Check the pages if anything is unclear (it should be quite straightforward). 

Try netstat maybe: netstat -abf 5 > activity.txt let it capture a couple of minutes then read the text file for packet sniffers otherwise, maybe fiddler (free packet sniffer but handy) might help you - you could of course install wireshark as well. 

I did that before with windows 7 and tried this - reinstalling windows 7 and when given the choice to 'upgrade' or 'install fresh' i told it to do it as an upgrade. It found the right partition and solved the problem. 

Windows 7 detects both monitors, and gives you the option in the display settings to mirror or to extend. It is built into the OS. From what I have seen, I do not believe you can do both at once however. Just one or the other. 

Not familiar with 'humble bundle' but regardless-- if you are looking for torrent files, any file you could search for on say, google.com, search a filename (or topic) you are looking for and add the word 'torrent' in the search. Google tracks pretty much everything... Example Search: freeware torrent (would find any torrents of freeware that are listed as freeware...) There really is not another way unless you know of other specific search sites to go to. Be careful though, you may find legality is not where you think it is on this one. Update: In the op's posting it is indicated in a comment that Humble Bundle may provide torrent links as their method of software distribution to their customers. If that is the case, this is perfectly okay, and it may be required to contact any tech support at Humble Bundle to try to recover any that are lost. 

Google's study on disk failures is to my knowledge the largest available research from real-life data concerning disk failures. They found a surprisingly small correlation between utilization/temperature/power cycle counts and disk failure. That is, there are other variables that have a larger influence. Google found that when some specific SMART values started to increase, the drive had a 40 times greater risk of failing within two months as compared to a "healthy" drive, but when working on such a minimal set as one does in a home environment, this is not really anything one can draw any real conclusions from. The sample size is simply too small to draw raw conclusions on almost all parameters for home PC:s concerning disk failure (well, don't let them endure physical stress (drop them, etc.)). "Is it based on", you say. Well, perhaps to some extent, but probably so small that it is not noticeable in such a small sample. 

Apparently it was not GNU find that was used, but BusyBox. You should then be able to create a temporary file with and a date in the future and then use the switch for such as: 

2. To count alpha ("alphanumeric" is probably what you really want) characters in a file name you could do 

It seems like you are happy just to kill a named screen session belonging to your user, and not really interested in the pid. In that case, with a screen named "", you can run 

I have had a few weird problems with desktop HP printers that are similar. The only way I have gotten windows to detect the printers again in my situations was to uninstall the printer driver, reboot and install the driver from scratch and then the printer works. One in particular is more flaky than its counterparts, it is an older model and I am just assuming there is some sort of damage with the unit itself since it supposedly worked better years before, but has stayed on the same XP system. 

Your OS can be set to allocate and handle resources differently for running programs vs background tasks. To see a simple example of this on Windows 7, right click on my computer -> properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Performance -> Advanced Right at the top you will notice a section called processor scheduling and you can see where they give you a choice as to which you prefer to have better access to resources. If you are talking about something other than resource allocation you will need to provide more information about what you observe is different between the two methods and we can go from there. 

I've had to deal with some issues like this on a clients workstation before. We needed a utility called CleanWipe which is only legitimately obtained from their support after opening a ticket (It might have changed). I found the following link which explains a little more about the CleanWipe tool and obtaining it $URL$ 

Debian (and thus Ubuntu) does not seem to have a package called "" as you have noticed (at least not in every available version). Looking at $URL$ it seems that the upstream source package named is used to build the Debian packages: 

There are many ways to mirror directories where newer date stamps get precedence. I use 's command in a similar context, which is scriptable. You will still have problems if you mirror before starting to work on a file, edits it, and then finds that someone has uploaded a new version during this time. What you most probably need in circumstances like these is version control, specifically distributed version control, such as Mercurial or Git. 

The concept of "drivers" is not the same is in Windows either; it is often a question of modules contained in the kernel or loaded separately. The later behave much more like regular programs. 

does not necessarily work alphabetically, but it works in the order you supply its arguments (with it becomes more complicated, but that doesn't matter here). If you wrote exactly as you said, the will expand to all file names in an alphabetical manner. So yes, you have removed files alphabetically. Try executing 

As I said in a comment, the timestamp format makes my approach seem convoluted, but it is mostly mechanic repetition. 

in a terminal (run first if it complains about already being started, but since you say it doesn't work, it most probably is not running. Prefix if it complains about permissions) should get you more detailed output on why PulseAudio won't start, which will enable you to find more specific info in your case. If the error message is not clear enough, just keep adding :s, e.g.
