You can use with a combination of and . Let's say that the function you're using currently has the format: 

Usually, you would use a , but the index and the values to be pulled are in the wrong order, in that case, use and : 

entered as array formula (with Ctrl+Shift+Enter) as from cell . Cell C2 will have the formula and dragged up to until at most C7. 

Your formula seems to be working for me. If you aren't using it properly (i.e. by not using Ctrl+Shift+Enter), you should be getting blanks. One thing you can do is to make the formula a bit shorter by using like this: 

Note: Since the above is an array formula, instead of evaluating it with Enter, press and hold Ctrl+Shift and then Enter retrieves the highest freq with the desired DB value. 

It basically checks for the sign of each cell's and multiplies them by a specific number. If all are negative, returns 8 so that is picked. If A and B are positive, we get a sum of 5, hence . If A and C are positive, we get a sum of 3, hence . 

This formula will be working correctly only when you use Ctrl+Shift+Enter because it's an array formula. 

It's in the , so that if is not equal to , it will multiply the rounded value of C6 by . is used as: 

After that, you can hit Ctrl+I (Invert selection or do "Select" > "Invert Selection" from the menubar to select everything outside the ellipse, then press Delete to remove the unneeded part: 

If however you have a cell containing and want the result to be , that's yet another matter, because 's job is completed once it found what it was looking for in a cell and will return . In that case, I would suggest counting each cell to be checked (because the above function can be used to look into whole columns): 

Drag/fill to the bottom. If there is any one value in column A that has a in C, it will return . You might want to copy/paste as values and removing column C after that to lighten your worksheet. 

You can then put a filter by selecting column E and inserting a filter, then filter on numbers above 4 (or equal to or greater than 5) If you click in the pivot table and go to the pane 'Design' > 'Subtotals' > 'Do not show subtotals', you will not see the or in the pivotable below, thus making the filtering easier. You can also collapse by clicking on the little - button right next to it if you want (but the subtotal will reappear). 

If you absolutely don't want to use another column, you could try using conditional formatting to help the filtering. Select cell A1 then the whole column, then use the conditional formatting with 'New Rule' and formula (last option): 

If you want to add another column, you will use the formula. Add the other column with And use as follows: 

Assuming that the data values fun in the range of C3:H7, you can use and , along with to round your input to match the required values: 

You can use an array formula and to get the last freq since this column is in ascending order, the last freq will be the highest freq: 

Assuming that you have the month in column A, the type of programme in column B and the minutes in column C, you can use : 

Since you mentioned phone numbers, I believe that you should use a lookup function in the conditional formatting: 

Text operations (like , , , etc) return text values and not numeric ones. A more 'formal' way would be to use : 

You can use a or a function on the email since this is a unique field, but I would prefer using here since you don't actually need the values in the second table. Let's say that the second table is in and first table (in ) has headers in cells A1 through C1 and the information starts in row 2. Put this formula in cell D2: 

Both and aren't available on some earlier versions of Notepad++. I don't remember exactly when they were introduced, but they work on v6.5.2. 

In cell A2, just put ; it's the first value and counting itself will give a circular reference warning. As from cell A3, put the formula: 

To do it in one "swoop", you can select the column where you need to add the numbers (for this example, select A2 to A8). Then hit Ctrl+G and select Special... > "Blanks" > OK. Press (without touching anything else) and paste this: 

Copy the three (or more) columns and paste them in a new Notepad++ file. Hit Ctrl+H to get the Find/Replace popup and put in find, put in replace and check the "Extended" option. Replace all. You will find that everything got in one column, which you can copy and paste directly in excel. 

If the dates are guaranteed to be sorted, you can use this formula for the start date instead (which should be a little faster): 

EDIT: Misunderstood your question. Here's a formula to always calculate the difference between the first value in a column and the last value in that column: 

This takes (91.23-91), which gives 0.23 and times 10 to give 2.3 and turns it into an integer: 2, or 

In the cell you want to place the second dropdown, use a data validation and pick "List" and in the 'Source', use the formula: 

After that, copy everything and paste as values to remove formulas. Select columns G to I and replace all , and by nothing through Ctrl+H. The french functions in order mentioned above: 

These are space characters. Just find 'space' and replace by nothing. The cell by definition is not 'blank' but contains characters that are not visible in normal conditions. Filtering however will show them as being blank. 

Entered as an array formula (i.e. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter instead of Enter after inputting the formula). will get the number of cells with values. in the denominator is the number of months (Jan - Jul) plus 1. is the array formula here, which will find the first position of the non-blank cell. 8 minus this position will give you the number of cells from the first non-blank cell to the last cell, including blanks. 

You could perhaps convert the time into text using the function and formatting the result back to time: 

Adjust the range as necessary. This will blanket a whole range, remove the last character of each, then add them together. If you really have only or but can have bare numbers like , then you could use this instead: 

The above will give you the corresponding B value for the matching A number, and give you blank if there are no matches. 

In a new column, let's say 'Z', concatenate all the cells with a unique delimiter. I think that is a possible delimiter for this function. It will work if there are no anywhere in your data. In row 2 for instance, you can have: 

This one treats the number as a string and takes the 4th character (position 4, taking 1 character) and the is to convert the string back to number. You also can have: 

this gives the short month ( gives today's date, converts it). Then turns the short month concatenated to the range to a range for the to evaluate. 

Click on cell A1 and select the whole sheet (Ctrl+A) or click on cell A then click on the intersection of columns and row labels to select everything. Select Conditional Formatting, then New Rule. Select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format" and in the input box "Format values where this formula is true", insert: 

As long as they are numbers, Excel can provide special formatting. Otherwise, I'm afraid there's no way around but formulas or VBA. As for your formula, it can be shortened a bit: 

Are you sure? Try selecting everything in the text and check then do the 'Replace All'. I suspect that your cursor was at the end of the file when you clicked 'Replace All' and the option was "Direction: Down". I do that myself sometimes without realising it only later! 

This will pick the appropriate named range and get only the Products that corresponds to the relevant category, of course, if the naming of ranges was properly done. 

And drag the formula down to the bottom. So basically, if the cells B2 and B1 are the same, add one to the previous numbering, otherwise, start anew to 1. 

Copy the first cell containing . Select the cells of the 15 products to be changed. Hit Ctrl+K (Or F5) then click Special... Select "Visible cells only". Paste with Ctrl+V 

Drag and drop each field into the boxes; Age into the Row Labels box and Height into the Values box: 

Extracts the month with its preceding space. Then multiply the whole thing by 1 to get the datevalue. You can format as via custom formatting and the dates will be ready to be imported to SQL. As with @CLockeWork's formula, since no year is mentioned in the formula, the sheet will take the current year. If you need to specify it, you'll have to do it manually, for example, like this: 

If you want to get a table with a summary of all the and the sum of each group of areas, then a PivotTable will be easiest/fastest. 

And you put and instead in cells A17 and B17. However, this flexibility comes at a price, called volatility; meaning that these functions will recalculate at even the smallest change in the workbook and if you have a lot of them, or have a bulky workbook, the difference is hard to ignore. You might opt, in such cases, for a bit less flexibility, if you have specific formulae, for example, if you can have only a limited number of evaluations, you can use with a certain key number: 

Since you already know the word, just put it there. The above will return the same result as the first formula. It looks for in the three cells and if not found, you get an error which is handled by and get a blank. 

The means that exact match, you'll most of the time prefer this over the other options. Put that in the formula box and pick your formatting. Make sure you have selected the whole column A before applying the conditional formatting. 

Select cell A1, then select column A (this is to ensure that A1 is the active cell within the selected range). Open the conditional formatting dialog (the one from the New Rule option) and pick the last option; using a formula to determine the formatting. In the entry box there, insert: 

If you can't find the tab 'Developer', go to 'Excel Options' by clicking on the round excel button at the top left of the window, 'Popular' and check 'Show Developer tab in the Ribbon', then 'OK'. Finally, to use it, simply do the usual Ctrl + Shift + ; and it should be working. Try it out and let me know how it goes! 

Where, if you put in A17 of the 6th sheet, and in B17 of the same sheet, your formula will compare the sheetA A1 value with the sheetB A1 value. If you change A17 to B and B17 to A, it will swap the values around. You can of course put C, D or E in those two cells. If you want to put the whole sheet name, the formula becomes: 

Select the column (or whatever range your data covers) then hit Ctrl+G and select Special... > "Blanks" > OK. Press (without touching anything else) and push the up button. Now, do NOT press Enter but press Ctrl+Enter. After this, you should see that all the cells should be nicely filled up. Select the whole of column C, copy, and paste as values to remove the formulae so that there's no problem when you filter or do other operations. 

This will count the number of cells in N:N that are less than or equal to C2, and that are more than or equal to L2 

Notice that there is a number for each of the cells within the range (C4:R4 has 16 cells, therefore there are 8 1's and 8 0's) 

I know that Excel's Find doesn't support Regex, otherwise I'd suggest that you use find on (there's a space after the T which gets ignored on posting...). However, I think that you can achieve something similar to this by using Conditional formatting: 

Copy the three (or more) columns and paste them in a new Word Document. Click on the little paste button that appears and select "Keep text only". Hit Ctrl+H to get the Find/Replace popup and put in find, put in replace. Click the "More" button and check "Use Wildcards", then click "Replace All". This step is to remove extra tab characters. Now do a Find on and replace all by . You will find that everything got in one column, which you can copy and paste directly in excel. 

And when you pick 'Fill without Formatting', your formulas will be copied without the background being copied over. [Note for formulas, you won't get "Fill Series", I just got the picture from google =P] I still prefer using the paste formulas only, since I can easily put it in the quick access toolbar and use Alt + [Some number] as shortcut. 

Click on the Format button and format it as you would format EUR amounts. Repeat steps 1-4 for GBP and USD, changing the formula in step 3 to and respectively. 

Press OK and repeat for the negative values, except using for the formula and the font as red for the formatting. 

You should be able to specify which folders you want to sync in your dropbox preferences. I don't know how to do it on your phone, but on windows, I usually right click, click the little gear, then pick Preferences, go to tab Advanced and click the button Selective Sync... From there, I pick the folders I want to sync. These will apply only to this machine. You can then change the settings on your phone, and other OS. 

This counts those 2008 which are Mazda and adds them to those 2008 which are Toyota. Or maybe would be simpler? 

Entered as an array formula with Ctrl+Shift+Enter. returns an array of and . If the range is equal to C, then we get the array , and returns , which becomes when 1 is taken off it. Then index returns the cell B6, which is picked up by to make the range . If is changed to , we get: , which returns and the becomes . 

Most formulas in excel do not update their formulas if they refer to closed workbooks. Now, if you open a workbook the formulas refer to, excel will try to update it immediately. Your problem I believe is that changes have been made to B.xls and the formulas in A.xls are trying to refresh its formulas when you opened B.xls. Because there has been changes in B.xls from since the formulas in A.xls were last calculated (such as sheets were renamed or plainly deleted), the formulas in A.xls cannot find the previous reference, and so return . I think you can have two options to avoid this: 

You can change the results in the quotes as you wish. If the two tables are in the same sheet, you can drop and altogether from the formula. 

clicking the first sheet, going to the last sheet by clicking the arrow: , Hold Shift and click the last sheet (you should see the colour of the sheets turning a bit lighter; they are all selected), Do the necessary edits on that last sheet. 

That should remove all the small differences out. Apply that to the columns where you're having the lookup and the match values. 

Do you really want to get the formatting? If you want to use formulae, you can use an associated with : 

Drag those two formulas to the end of the list and wait until the calculations are done. After that, copy the data and paste as values (Paste Special > Paste Values. This will speed things up onwards) and apply a filter so you can remove all the , if any, from the table. Sort your table to remove spaces in between rows.
