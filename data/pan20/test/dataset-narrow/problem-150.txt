If I give a client a static IP on any of the new VLANs it can ping it's default gateway regardless of which switch it's physically plugged into. It can't go any further than that. Here is a 'show ip route' from the routing switch: 

VLAN1 is the existing flat network. I am trying not to disrupt network outages while I get things working so I've left it in place on the new ProCurves. VLAN1 is currently working just fine but I suspect that is because DHCP is still handing out the firewalls IP as the default gateway and not the new .254 address I've created. Our firewall is a Cisco RV016 and is currently in gateway mode with RIP disabled. Once I get inter-VLAN routing working I suspect I either need to create a static route that points to the Cisco for 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 or enable RIP routing on the firewall. For now I want to get inter-VLAN routing work and I'll tackle the firewall after. I've done the following on all three switches: 

and from the firewall: $URL$ and a sample static routes I've configured on the firewall to access the new VLANs: $URL$ So close! Update - 2015-06-18 @ 16:49 Progress. I found the error I made configuring the routes on the RV016. I should have set the gateway to 192.168.11.254 (the IP for VLAN 1 that resides on my RS). That looks like it fixed everything. 

Each interface on your NIC should be assigned a different IP address or there will be an addressing conflict. You can either receive an IP address via DHCP or set one manually as you see through your GUI. Each interface also has its own MAC address for layer 2 communication. 

I have an interface that is Gigabit connecting to an interface on a carrier ATT router. The bandwidth of the ethernet circuit connecting to this interface is 10mbs. Is there a way to set the speed of the interface to match the bandwidth of the circuit? If QoS is then applied to my gigabit interface, will it be applied and aware of the 10mb rate limit? 

Default BGP keepalives are sent every 60 seconds. If a participating device does not receive a return response within 180 seconds, the default Hold Time, a reconvergence will occur. So by default, it will take 3 minutes for your devices to determine a neighbor is down before reconvergence. 

sho ip int brief will give you a list of all the interfaces and their status as well as protocol. It will not show you if a cable is "unplugged" but will tell you if something is plugged into the interface and sending frames. sho int Will allow you to see if an interface is UP and whether or not protocol is also UP. If you are just looking to monitor status changes on the terminal, term monitor 

The routes aren't being picked up by the client access switches is my guess but I thought the whole point of RIP was that it took care of that for me. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Update 1 - 2015-06-18 @ 15:24 I've disabled routing on the two user access switches and disabled RIP on my RS. It looks like I can put myself on any of those VLANs and ping any of the other new VLANs gateways but not other hosts that are currently on the new VLANs. I still cannot get out to the internet (even with a default route on the RS to my firewall) AND I cannot access my 192.168.11.0 legacy network with or with out a static route to it assigned to my RS. Here is the new config for the RS: 

I've been bashing my head against this for far to long. I'm hoping someone can help me out. I'm rebuilding a clients network and this is my first kick at routing. I decided to keep things simple. We are using 3x HP ProCurve 2920's. Two of them service user connections and the third one will act as our router and be where our server and other network uplink to. Here is my VLAN layout: 

(sorry I did not found the original reference, but a look a google leads to several references). As commented by @Zac67, it depends on the context. Your assumption is right if you consider only sending data "blindly". I mean if you keep sending frames at the same rate without looking at loss/congestions (eg. with UDP). The following is only the results of some thoughts. This is not intended to be the absolute truth. However when dealing with congestion, some mechanisms make use of congestion notification. The basis are: when you send a packet from A to B, B send a message to A (ie. the notification). The source do whatever he wants (adapt throughput, other parameters, ...). This was the case for TCP, when the destination acknowledges a packet at a time. In that case, and in order to follow the packet conservation principle, the source send a new packet when he receives the notification, that is after the sum of the propagation delays of A->B and B->A. Considering that both A->B and B->A delays are equals, a new packet enter the pipe after . In that case, no to waste bandwidth, the frame size can be doubled. 

1.) Yes, the gateways should reside on the L3 switch. If you were running Routing on a Stick, you would instead house their gateways on the Router. Your current configuration is inline with what is called a "collapsed core" design. Where the L3 core performs both switching and VLAN routing and acts as a distribution layer. 2.) No, your L3 routing should be occuring on your 3750. 3.)If the cable modem is in bridge mode, there should be no double NAT. Bridge mode should disable all the routing features and leave the cable modem as just a cable modem. 4.) I would, just so you can hit devices on the seperate VLANs. 5.) The address of the inside interface of the Cable modem may be .1. Leave it as it is. Like Ron said, it doesn't need to be changed. Can we see the NAT configuration of your router? It will be helpful in identifying your NAT issue. ****EDIT**** This link may be helpful: Configuring NAT I failed to take note of the NAT statement you had originally. This brings into question the claims made by your ISP. You're both able to hit the internet and your being PAT'd with the correct commands. Are you experiencing any problems? 

Current flow probes (using eg. IPFIX, netFlow v5/9, sFlow) are able to monitor flows defined at least by the tuple < source IP, source Port, IP protocol, destination IP, destination Port, source interface, destination interface >. But it seems to me that this flow definition might consume probe CPU (even if we use traffic sampling) and probe<->collector bandwidth So questions are : 

If your tunnels follow the same path, but are defined in order to provide several QoS, you should look at Differentiated Service standards and how it integrates with MPLS and Traffic Engineering. Eg. E-LSP where the class of traffic is inferred from the MPLS EXP field, which can be itself inferred from the IP DSCP field at the MPLS network ingress. However in the example, you will have only one tunnel, where traffic classification and priorization is achieved. If your tunnels follow different path, By default Cisco MPLS routers achieves a weighted load-balancing of the traffic across available path (considering that LSP Tunnels have the same ingress and egress). Weights can be inferred from bandwidth (eg. allocated with RSVP-TE), or administratively configured weights. As you proposed, you can also use route-maps and ACLs to enforce given flows to be switched through a specific LSP tunnel. However I assume that to stay efficient, packet inspection won't be beyond layer 3 (IP source/destination, IP DSCP/TOS). Considering your comments, if you need to implement it using BGP, you shoold look at Flowspec. This standards allows distributing filtering rules via BGP. You can configure the action to achieve to the filtered traffic, eg.: 

Trunk ports pass all vlan data unless otherwise specified within the Switchport Mode Trunk command. So at this point, the switchport access command does nothing. If the user who configured this switch had the intention of limiting the data that passed through this trunk to only 1 vlan, he or she should have used Switchport Trunk Allowed Vlan 100 

I'm having trouble finding the actual temperature point where a C2821 router will send out the trap for temperature. So far, I know the operating temperatures are from 0C to 40C. But at which point does it send the trap? 

I have 4 VWIC2-2MFT-T1/E1 installed on a C2921 router running Version 15.3(3)M2, everytime I enter the framing esf and linecode b8zs, the router accepts the commands but the controller remains with the following configs: 

I have a layer 3 3750 advertising its vlan interfaces via EIGRP to two routers. R1 and R2 connect to MPLS via 2 different carriers using BGP. R1 is the preferred path. My question is, how do I configure a default route for Core1 using EIGRP that will be aware of failures on either of these carriers. 

Considering that we do not deal with VLAN that adds a layer in the graph, but with a basic configuration (no sub interface, ...) the red area is related to a single subnetwork/network. In fact the right term is broadcast domain (and not sub/network). That is the switch (I mean L2 only switch) is not aware of IP addresses and the switch is achieved by only looking at the ethernet header (ie. a map between the destination MAC addresse and the outgoing interface). Therefore, considering the figure you provided and the captions (core, distribution, access) that seems to define a network hierarchy, the left interface of the "core" router may has a configured IP address (eg. 192.168.1.1/24) and all computers/servers directly connected to the switches in the red area (connected to the left interface of router) will belong to the same subnet (192.168.1.0/24). 

If by 'active TAP' you mean an active way to "trap"/capture traffic and forward it (or not) modified to the real destination, this can be achieved in several ways: 

It seems to me that you mis-understand the TAP concept. It only means that you duplicate a link. Then you are able for example :
