This will access all 5x disks at the same time, with 512 byte blocks, reading the first 4GiB. How about writing to the individual disks? 

Resizing a filesystem is typically very quick - you just need to extend everything, writing new metadata into the empty space, etc... What is slow, however, is moving a filesystem. As far as I'm aware, there is no way to extend a filesystem from the front (which is what you're ideally after). This is because you'd have to rewrite all of the file addressing information. Consider the following diagram. By pulling the start of the partition forward, we've changed the address of the red/green/blue files, and even the end of the partition. You'd also need to be careful with alignment of the data, and other more technical aspects - the whole thing is a very complex operation. 

A ground loop - where the PC and KVM are on different ground points. This is less likely, in a residential situation. 

So this is a bit odd, unless you're quoting a random negative number, or set Quake 3 to listen on non standard ports. would be if displayed as a signed value. 

I'm comfortable with DNS and how it works, but this question lead me down a path I've not considered before. Suppose I host a DNS server for my own domain () at , and this DNS server advertises the following (simplified) zone: 

I've identified a method to extract the port number above, but if you can't / don't want to use , then would work nicely, but unfortunately your input appears to be not-quite-JSON, so we need to work a bit harder: Note: we need to pass the JSON in as the first argument, as the script is going in via stdin, so the approach above won't work nicely. 

It's also worth mentioning that UARTs can typically operate in 7-bit (text-only) and 8-bit (binary) modes. The typical that you see referrs to: 

NOTE: writing to or will probably be as deadly as trying to read from in these cases... SIGPIPE ahoy. 

Yes... it sounds quite likely that one of the regulators has been damaged, and your laptop may succumb to high battery drain or even overheating / staying warm. Such regulators aren't often monitored... so I would turn it off, let it cool down, and then check for warm areas of the case (or possibly even take it apart) To be honest I'm also surprised your Arduino is still working after a 9v injection - the ATMega2560 datasheet gives a "Maximum Operating Voltage" of 6v... 

You have to remember that "low" data rate things like watching a film will leave the drive in the idle state a significant majority of the time. For example 20-30Mb/s video will use approx 5MB/s of the drive's 550MB/s+ capability... or to put it another way less than 1%. So you are not really interested in the "in use" figures for this "watching a film on the train" use-case... you are much more interested in the idle power figures. In addition to this, do not forget the power consumption of the USB controller. 

You should look into using and the package - this will let you use NATing, rather than just 'forwarding' the connections by creating a new socket. Your configuration would look something like this: 

An SFP - Small Form-factor Pluggable Transceiver - is just a little device that converts a standard set of signals to another standard set of signals. They often convert to fibre Ethernet connections, but can equally provide copper Ethernet or even direct SFP-SFP connections. The SFP spec outlines the signals as well as the termination - in this case directly between the module and the host device. 

In response to your question... a 10 Gb/s link doesn't work "like 10x 1 Gb/s links"... it works "like 1x 10 Gb/s link". That said, 10x 1 Gb/s hosts should all be able to communicate at near line-speed with the one 10 Gb/s host. The maximum throughput / data rate on the wire should be close to 10 gigabits per second (~1.25 gigabytes per second). You can use copper, fiber or direct attach SFP (i.e: fiber isn't your only option). You'll also need to check the switch's "fabric" capacity will be sufficient for your needs. 

This automatically handles the rollover from to (interpreted as the first month of the following year). 

The reason that this signal behaviour is different is due to the running with PID = 1. Typically (e.g: running with PID != 1), any signal that the process doesn't explicitly deal with leads to the process being terminated - try sending a a . However, when running with PID = 1, unhandled signals are ignored, otherwise you'd end up with a kernel panic: 

You seem pretty set on using and a RaspberryPi, so here's another answer with a bit of a brain dump that will hopefully help you come to a solution. 

To address your comment, is "fine" - it works, and you'll probably have internet access... try this for eaxmple: 

To address your concern regarding the discrepancy between AnandTech's measured and Intel's reported power usage, I would question the method that AnandTech are using to get their figures - they didn't mention it in the report as far as I could see. 

edit: Thanks for the pictures. This is indeed a PCIe NVMe drive: Toshiba XG5 series (KXG5AZNV256G). Interestingly, this drive is capable of exceeding the PCIe 3.0 2x lane interface that it's connected via. Also note that this is a "Self Encrypting Device" (SED) - I can't comment on your ability to read this from a motherboard other than the original, see here for more info. 

Additionally, within the virtual machine (container), you will be unable to access any S.M.A.R.T. data due to Proxmox's use of loop devices. Proxmox does however apparently include the utility, so you might be able to monitor the health of your non-RAID volumes. To do this, you'll have to log in to the host itself rather than a virtual machine. 

This is question does not have a simple answer as there are many variables at play here. "RAID5" might sound like a standard thing... but it isn't. RAID5 isn't a standard between different manufacturer implementations, and potentially even between different products of a given manufacturer. The fact that this term is becoming more and more popular for simply referring to "storage with one parity device" muddies the waters further. Due to this alone, it's not easy to give you an "it'll do this" answer. With a "hardware RAID" setup you'll often find that undetected read errors are passed up through the system as successful without even verifying the data against the parity device - i.e: if a sector is not detected as bad by the storage device, then parity doesn't help. With more modern and advanced filesystems such as ZFS and Btrfs the data is checksummed and verified much more carefully (data hasn't been checksummed or verified at all previously). Here, a silent read error will be detected and corrected, even though the storage device was unable to detect it. Additionally, it's possible to determine if the parity device is at fault, or if the other device is at fault. When a storage device knows that a read was bad, then there are also a drastically different possibilities. Within the magnetic storage (Hard Disk Drive) arena you will find that:
