As far as I know, you can only tell Brocade to intercept (i.e. be able to understand) CDP or not (i.e. forward them along). If you have CDP off, then they will be forwarded on and won't show up in a show fdp neighbor output. If you are mixing vendors, I would recommend that you look at having them all run LLDP if possible. 

I see no problem with the basic premise, as long as you meant 192.168.1.0/24 and not 192.168.1.0/16 for the "middle" network (unless you are planning to utilize proxy ARP - bad idea). Also assuming you are planning on performing NAT on the Cisco/EdgeRouter (or else you will need either dynamic routing such as OSPF or static routes on the CPE device). A few suggestions, with the setup you describe you could configure a second EdgeRouter to provide redundancy (not sure if the Cisco platform is capable of this). With both devices connected to the CPE device, you would simply need to run VRRP on the internal LAN interfaces. This is more complex, but you can take a failure of one device without any of the offices being adversely affected. If you don't go with a redundant setup (or if you have multiple WAN IP addresses from your provider) and if the CPE device can be configured to do so, then you could operate it in a bridge/bypass mode so the Cisco/EdgeRouer handles all the outside traffic directly. Eliminates a L3 network that isn't needed, avoids a double NAT situation on your side and gives you more control overall on your gateway device. Finally, if you have the interface available, set up a fourth LAN network that you can plug into directly if needed, especially if you are not one of the three office tenants. That way you won't have to connect to one of the office networks (which they may object to) anytime you need to do maintenance. 

In addition, you need to keep in mind the capabilities of the tools you have on hand. There are field testers that may not support cables under a minimum length, but this is a limitation of the tester and not based on the standard. Obviously if you are testing with a unit that has a minimum length of 1 meter, you would want to avoid cables less than 1 meter as you would not be able to get accurate results. 

This only deals with how the DHCP server responds to a client DHCP REQUEST for a certain IP address that is not provided by the DHCP server configuration. If it isn't part of the DHCP scope on the Mikrotik and the setting is yes, then it responds with a DHCP NACK message, which should prompt the client to do a DHCP DISCOVER. If set to no, then it will just ignore those packets (assuming that there may be another DHCP server to handle the request). This should have no effect on a statically assigned IP address since they do not make a DHCP REQUEST. However, I always prefer to still do my static IP addresses through static reservations on the DHCP server when possible. 

My general rule of thumb: if you don't need or aren't currently using a feature, don't enable it. Enabling features you don't need/use only exposes yourself to more problems. At the very least, this adds unnecessary lines to the configuration, making it longer and/or more complex. The longer and more complex a configuration, the more prone it is to human errors and it can slow down troubleshooting processes. It can also expose you to bugs/problems in the code that you would not otherwise be subject to without the unnecessary service. If this is something you plan to implement in the short term, then you may consider it. However keep in mind that when you are adding your additional links, you can add the link aggregation at that time with a minimum of downtime (if done correctly). 

The Cisco WS-C2960S-48-FPS-L has 4 SFP ports which operate at 1Gbps. From the documentation I can find on the Broadcom 57840S, it has four SFP+ ports that operate at 10Gbps. I find no mention that it can support lower data rates. As for your Cisco Twinax cables, the only ones I am aware of are 10G. These will not work in your 2960S. A couple of posts that may be somewhat relevant to this from the Cisco forums would be here and here 

VLANs are logical networks created within the physical network. Their primary use is to provide isolation, often as a means to decrease the size of the broadcast domain within a network, but they can be used for a number of other purposes. They are a tool that any network engineer should be familiar with and like any tool, they can be used incorrectly and/or at the wrong times. No single tool is the correct one in all networks and all situations, so the more tools you can use, the better you are able to work in more environments. Knowing more about VLANs allows you to use them when you need them and to use them correctly when you do. One example of how they can be used, I currently work in an environments where SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) devices are used widely. SCADA devices typically are fairly simple and have a long history of less than stellar software development, often providing major security vulnerabilities. We have set the SCADA devices in their in a separate VLAN with no L3 gateway. The only access into their logical network is through the server they communicate with (which has two interfaces, one in the SCADA VLAN) which can be secured with it's own host based security, something not possible on the SCADA devices. The SCADA devices are isolated from the rest of the network, even while connected to the same physical devices, so any vulnerability is mitigated. 

Some 3600's do require 802.3at power and it looks like this one does, and for some reason it is only drawing 802.3af power levels. Not sure if there is a bug in either the switch or AP code that could cause this, but here are a couple things to try. In some cases (usually with non-Cisco devices) I have had to add on the following on the interface (shut the interface before adding/removing): 

Because you are referencing two different examples that are slightly different. The first example which is above uses Rs as the bottleneck (link with lowest available bandwidth). In the second example, Rc is the bottleneck. This results in a slightly different way to calculate the time needed to transfer the data. Edit: Also re-reading the posted question with more care, the first example appears to be talking about calculating the average throughput where the second example appears to be calculating the average time it takes to transfer a file. Not having the full context of the book in front of me, it is likely that wording on the two questions is slightly different. 

They are somewhat a hold out from when bits were precious and processing data in certain ways (binary AND or binary OR) was less taxing. Today, they are still useful in other cases, as Aaron has already mentioned. 

You aren't providing a lot of information to go on, but I will assume this is a relatively simple flat network. 

As Ricky has pointed out, no this will not work. For people new to fiber, I always thought HP provided a nice visual layout in some of their documentation of the different transceiver types, the fiber they work on, and their distance limitations. You can find this chart on page four of this document for one. Other documents have the same information, but in a more tabular format (rather than the graphic/chart). For example, you can start on page nine of this document (other vendors provide this as well, but I stuck with HP for this answer). 

Take note, that while one server may contain the information for both the "my-example.com" zone and the "3.2.1.IN-ADDR-ARPA" zones, they could also be two different servers. Further, it is often the case that the servers are run by two different companies. For instance, if you pay CompanyX to host your website on their server, you may control the DNS zone for your domain pointing to the IP address of CompanyX's serve (which may be hosting many different domains from different clients) but CompanyX controls the zone for the reverse lookup of the IP address. Their reverse lookup for that IP address would likely reflect a server/domain of CompanyX's. Even when an entity is entitled to control both the forward and reverse zones, they are not required to provide DNS services for either. You are perfectly within your rights to register a domain name and not provide any DNS service for it. The end result is that this means that even if you do get a response to a reverse lookup, it may have no relation to the domain name of the service you are accessing. You may be accessing "www.my-example.com" but the reverse lookup of that IP address may give you "server37.companyx.com" or something else entirely. 

Short Answer: The answer is that it depends. Longer Explanation: Naturally, when a device is sending out unicast IP traffic, it needs to add the layer 2 headers (including destination MAC address) to the frame before sending it on the wire. This IP-to-MAC mapping is exactly what the ARP process is there to provide to the host. Based on this statement, one might think that this naturally means that ARP traffic will automatically be sent before any ICMP traffic. However, once a host learns this IP-to-MAC mapping, it inserts it into an ARP table for some period of time. So a host will check this ARP table for such a mapping first and only send out ARP if there is no entry. So in your example, let's say that Host A has no entry for Host B's IP address in the ARP table. When Host A pings Host B the traffic exchange is like this: 

In general, if you learned IOS 11, you can jump into an IOS 15 device and still feel somewhat at home. That said, absolutely there are changes between different versions of IOS and even the same version of IOS on different platforms. There would be no progress if there were no changes and I personally wouldn't want to be running IOS 11 today. 

It really doesn't matter in this situation. Since SwB is only on VLAN 2 and SwC is only on VLAN 3, you can provide access with either a trunk/tagged port or an access port. However, if you want the management SVI on SwB and SwC to be in VLAN 1 like SwA, they will need to be trunk/tagged ports. 

The correct answer is you don't "fix" it at the patch panel. If you follow the code and it doesn't work, you need to fix the other side. One of the reasons people use T568A/B and not any straight through wiring pattern they want is that it makes troubleshooting and repairs much simpler, as you are finding out now. If you don't fix the other end now, you will be in the same situation (or someone else will) 5 years from now while trying to fix the camera side of the cable. I also firmly believe that infrastructure cabling should be infrastructure cabling, not a "long patch cord" running through a building. So I would terminate the camera end of the cables to a jack and use a patch cable to connect the cameras. If you really must take the shortcut (for instance, it is more important to get the camera up ASAP), then you can do so, but put this on your priority list of things to fix ASAP. Just "reverse" where you punch down, since brown is where white/orange should be on the far end, punch it down where white/orange should be. White/brown to orange, green to white/green, and white/blue to blue. I also recommend that you develop a cable standards document detailing how you expect cabling to be run for your organization and provide it to any contractor working at your site. Then enforce the document before you allow them to get paid. 

So, if an interface is not the TPA, it should hit a negative condition in response to and end the processing. If it is a match to the TPA, then again we swap the TPA and SPA. So again they should be the same. Additionally, if the TPA in the request where to reply with a different SPA, note that the original requester upon receipt of the reply would put the reply SPA into its ARP table. It would still not have an entry for the original request's TPA and as such would start the ARP process again. 

Not necessarily. The network can be separated into multiple VLANs or the links between MDF and IDFs can be L3 links. Either way, you may not be on the same LAN by connecting at one point. You would need more information about the network to know this answer. 

Since an AP has one or more radio interfaces, it is also a WLAN/wireless device. However, it's function is typically to provide a place for other WLAN devices to connect to get access to the network. 

No. IP addresses are used to identify devices or hosts, not networks. Therefore they do not identify networks. However, IP address ranges can be used to identify networks. 

If the bits actually had significance beyond being just bits, then you would end up with the following in hex: 

You clarified in your comments that you don't actually mean "broadcasts" but rather that you are asking if clients transmit omnidirectionally. The short answer is that most 802.11 client devices transmit in a pattern that covers a complete 360 degrees horizontally around the device because most are mobile and won't have a fixed facing towards the access point. They do this by using dipole antennas. The characteristics of how any RF device transmits is not determined by the client, but by the antenna used to transmit. Changing the antenna can have a significant impact on how the device transmits a signal. Generally speaking, most antennas will transmit some signal in most directions, but depending on the actual characteristics of the antenna in question, that signal transmitted in a certain direction can be very low to the point of being entirely useless. The majority of antennas will have a main "lobe" along which the signal will be strongest, a number of side or back lobes with weaker signal, and a number of areas where very little to no signal is generated. Additionally, with beamforming in use, a transmitter can also influence the nature of the propagated signal by transmitting specially formulated and timed transmissions from multiple antennas to strengthen the signal in certain directions and/or weaken it in others. Once a RF signal is transmitted, it is then subject to the physics of RF signals, which can bend and/or be reflected so signal will often cover areas where the antenna didn't transmit initially. 

Packet Tracer does not provide access to IOS. It provides access to an IOS-like environment that has a limited subset of IOS features/commands, mainly tailored to learn CCNA level concepts. As such, it doesn't surprise me that you do not have this option on the command line. 

From the Cisco documentation: "The ASA 5585-X IPS SSP must be at the same level as the ASA 5585-X SSP model; for example, if you have the ASA 5585-X with SSP-10, you can only install the IPS SSP-10." So, generally to answer your questions: 1) No, it should not be possible, and somewhere in the logging or debugging it will probably tell you that it is disabling the IPS-SSP because it isn't compatible; or it will show that the SSP is trying to transfer an incompatible image to the IPS-SSP. 2) If the module is disabled (or booting), the interfaces generally won't be shown. 3) This is really a moot point since you probably won't be able to do anything at all with the IPS-SSP if it is disabled or not booted entirely. 

This may be a bit "heavy handed" but sometimes the simplest solutions are best. Simply test to see if it works like a router. (Obviously, Jens Link's solution would be best for IPv6 but for IPv4 this wouldn't be as reliable.) Change the default gateway on your computer to each discovered IP address and do a traceroute to www.google.com. Even if it routes to another IP on the same network, it is still processing traffic as a router. Non-router devices should just drop/reject/error the traffic. I would recommend scripting this though, as it would be quite tedious to do manually. 

Please Note: These are not a complete working access lists; they are meant only as examples. While they may work in certain environments, it may create problems if you try to use it. For instance, it will not allow traffic such as DHCP if the DHCP server is on a different VLAN. 

You don't mention brand of the switch, any management software, or any configuration (in particular how that interface was previously configured), so I can only answer generically. Most default switch MAC address tables have a relatively low timeout to age out entries. Just because you are only seeing 19 devices from the same VLAN on a port currently doesn't mean that there aren't other devices that will need to utilize a different VLAN on the trunk. You say you "guessed that there was a switch connected to that interface." Guessing is a bad way to decide on making changes in a network. This indicates you do not understand the network in enough detail to be making the change and you should spend more time investigating before doing so.
