Some background story: this is related to a ridiculous software patent by Eolas that actually has recently been revoked (after some 15 years of trolling) due to prior art being established. Eolas patented plugins that automatically gained focus, which is why one has to click on e.g. Youtube controls before using them. The videos can autoplay by a technical loophole in the patent that doesn't cover a specific javascript implementation. This is also related to why plugins can't return focus to the browser by a simple in-plugin button combination. 

At least where I am this would cost less than half of what a dedicated tuner with HDMI output costs, once again: assuming you can get the VCR cheap. I have an old VCR for a similar purpose rigged up, but the specific monitor in this case takes component input directly so I don't need an extra converter. 

Phones with modems respond to AT commands over a serial port (at least I haven't seen a model that doesn't). When connected to the computer via USB, it opens a serial port to which you can connect e.g. with a Perl script using the module to listen for new messages (I'm sure similar modules exist for Python/etc). When a new message signal is given, read the latest message and then act on its contents. This should not be many lines of code to do by yourself (could likely be done in the order of 10-20 lines). The investigation will probably mostly be to find out the correct AT commands, but if you are in luck, you can find them on Google. The large generic programs that communicate with phones almost exclusively use AT commands and translation tables for different phones. If you like this path and want to find out more, start by using minicom or some other serial console program to probe your phone and what commands are available for it. 

Edit: as noted in the comment below (or in the original post if one notices the path ) the file was on a read-only media. Either the complete structure could be copied to a writable medium and the permissions changed, or one could run them directly from the disc with an explicit interpreter such as 

Assuming Linux since is mentioned: If by "login" you mean "graphical login" (which os reasonable since zenity is Gtk+ based), then one could put the test in (or equivalent depending on window/login manager) without sending it to the background before the window manager is started. This would halt the process until the test has returned. 

that is mentioned is in the package (named so in Debian based installations at least). Another alternative is that is in the package. 

As noted in a comment: if you perhaps want to run multiple Screen sessions in the future, use the session naming ability. Start a named session with 

The format of these files is aptly documented at the project's homepage and wiki. Fluxbox is more or less fully stylable through themes. By default it has a task bar, but that is removable in the theme file. 

I bought a Zalman fan with silicone pins with the following instructions (though my fan had no LEDs, thank Linus): 

Have you set it up correctly? What have you done to configure it? It will not "work" out of the box (if by "work" you mean spit out ready graphs of network usage). It is quite convoluted to do this the first time and might take some time. Try enabling some of the simplest available data series with as few dependencies as possible (usually the ones containing logged in users, memory status, etc.) to see if you can get any output at all. There is a graph preview mode in the admin interface — if you don't manage to get visible graphs there, then you should concentrate on that. Read up on general how-tos on the subject. If it is just the network graphs that are troublesome, the first step is to add an "Associated data query" in Console → Devices corresponding to your machine. Try to go from there and figure out the system. If graphs show up in this preview mode but are not generated to files, check permissions on the target directory. Though Cacti should log any errors, so maybe you are just not generating them at all. This is handled via Configuration → Settings → Graph export. 

You can most probably just use instead of in this context to do what you want, but as always when playing with fire: make very sure that it works before going in hard. 

If your computer looks this up to a different IP, you should try to find out why (try the command from one of your devices that work). You say that you tried different DNS servers. Try it again, and make sure the change actually initiates, i.e. save settings, reboot router and so on. Try DNS 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS), which demonstrably resolves to the correct IP: 

will start an independent session with session directory . Opera, as do Chrome, also supports incognito mode by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N, but this will come with the drawback that one cannot reopen closed tabs. 

A quick test case showed that it worked on this exact case, at least. If there are subdirs named e.g. or such, I believe you might exclude them as well. It's easy to get it to work in general cases, but to define a find command in all generality takes some testing. Test without the "-delete" statement to see which files it matches. PRESSTOP: changes its behaviour when is specified ( warns about this and won't go on when is specified). You could always pipe output to and , or write instead of , though. Examples: 

It would not make sense to increase output resolution more than the screen is capable of displaying. In best case it would have to rescale the output back to its native resolution (it must show is using a fixed number of pixels), which would require processing power and give you a worse result than just using the native resolution (most likely 1366x768, not 1399) due to interpolation errors. In worst case it would just fail and not give you an image at all. Sometimes it makes sense to send a resolution lower than the native resolution, e.g. for games where the graphics adapter doesn't have the power to render it smoothly at the native resolution, and use interpolation to show it on the full screen, but this should be avoided. 

Try starting with a different user profile via e.g. the switch on *nix, or on Windows. This should start a separate process. 

The display number is connected to the port number of the display if one hasn't set that manually (and differently), where 

This is only available for GNU find, but the GNU tools are the standard on Linux which you asked for. It is also installable on more or less every relevant platform. 

I had more or less the exact same problem on an older AMD MB, I believe from MSI (which led me on a frustrating error searching process with several graphic cards before I noticed that they had nothing to do with it). A friend with a POST card (which he had bought for $4) checked it, and it turned out that the BIOS simply hanged at a certain stage every second boot (he claimed it was exactly every second boot when he tested it with his reader. My notes from the error searching process indicated that it was more irregular, but then I switched graphic cards lots of times as well, and other factors might have influenced it). This was also something that suddenly started to happen to the machine after several years of running (and some crashes, due to a failing hard drive. Can't know if it was related). My "solution" for my specific case was that the hardware was obsolete anyway and needed to be replaced. I don't know if it is fixable directly in hardware. The only thing I'd test is to update/reflash the BIOS drivers and hope for the best. Otherwise, my bet is on a new MB. 

BusyBox does not support that date format, but the principle is the same and its supports . Creating the reference file with a correct date is left as an exercise for the reader (always convenient to write). 

You probably have Perl and therefore in most distributions also the command installed (often linked to simply , in e.g. Debian and Ubuntu). If that is the case, then you can do it with a one-liner: 

Each new user connecting spawns a new session with a specific PID. You could use to print which commands are inherited from which session, and then cross check this PID in . Example (anonymized): I logged in to a remote server with 3 simultaneous sessions, with the same remote user. I now want to find out from which IP the client came that ran the command . 

(see ) but in practice will only reformat lines longer than anyway, so it might not matter much in neither speed nor result. (I am using for "virtual column" instead of for "column", since the latter really calculates a certain number of bytes into the line. This can lead to unexpected results when using multibyte encodings, which is often a reason to be wary. In practice it is not a real issue for the same reason as above, regarding that will not reformat lines shorter than anyway.) 

will start a VNC server on another display (e.g. on port 5901 as compared to the default on , port 5900) in the background that you can connect to remotely. More random tips: if you resize the applications to the VNC viewer's window size manually, it will emulate native resolution quite well, I find. 

, which is implied to be something that should be avoided. 2. See earlier discussion. 3. Very un-Linux-y in my eyes, but of course it works. 4. "Any path you like" In practice "yes", but why would one not like to have them mounted in an organized manner? 

The in its form only makes sense if there is just a single match, but the inode number should be unique on that partition unless there exists hard links to the same file. You can test this by running find without arguments first to see if you get multiple matches. If that is the case, you can e.g. refine the pattern to only match the file you want. Since the renaming does not depend on the exact characters of the filename, there should be no problem with entering strange code points. 

Or, simpler, replace the last two lines with (will also handle multiple matches) (though it is untested): 

The PS/2 and USB connectors are not equivalent. Many devices can be used in both using a passive adapter (but then almost always USB->PS/2, not the other way around), but not all [1]. There are "active adapters" available that connect to USB and simply gives you two PS/2 connectors. If this is what you have, then something is weird, but you probably have a pure rewiring adapter. 

, this command will pick out files ending in in directories in the current working directory that contain the word , but does not end in (if I interpreted your question correctly): 

Regarding mount names, I would also suggest to at least avoid naming them e.g. and so on, since this is not really a partition specific parameter (as UUID already addresses). Personally, I use a combination of a personally assigned ID number and the partition size, such as . The partition specific unique ID enables me to tab complete by a single number after . But this is all discussion on very individual preferences, so I'll stop here. 

is good and competent and will probably work fine in this case as mentioned by Iserni's answer, if you dig into the manual for available options. I'll just state some alternatives. I use LFTP for transfers and syncing over both FTP and SFTP. It has an internal queuing system that works well for my use case, supports mirroring, reverse mirroring, FXP, all regular FTP functions and more (even Bittorrent nowadays). In this case it seems simple enough to just use a script and , but I wanted to mention a program that simplified FTP transfers for me greatly. I've also used NcFTP that has a very nice batch system, but the deal breaker in LFTP's favor for me was that it supported both FTP and SFTP. Another alternative is which also supports FTP, and perhaps you are already used to this. It also has quite advanced options ready as per filtering and resuming broken downloads. An advantage with a "real" FTP client as compared to batch use is that a single connection to the server can be reused, which might boost performance. I'm not sure there is such an alternative for , but maybe there is. If this is a true one-off operation, you could probably use more or less anything.
