If you want to restrict management access to the switch, you need to apply the ACL to the VTY interfaces: 

The answer to all these questions will show you where it makes most sense to add redundancy. You may find that it is not cost-effective to add a second WAN circuit, even if it were a different provider. Or, it may be important to have redundant servers than redundant routers. So, the short answer to your question is, “best practice” says you should carefully analyze where redundancy makes most sense. 

I'm afraid that's not how S/RTBH works. The router doesn't know who initiated a connection; routers generally do not maintain connection state (firewalls do that). Routers treat each packet individually, so the routing decision for an individual packet is made without regard to what happened before. S/RTBH works because you are, in effect, spoofing the route: you tell your border router that the attacker's IP is inside your network, not on the Internet. When the router receives the bad packet from the outside interface, the RPF check fails and the packet is dropped because the router thinks the IP is on the inside. S/RTBH can't protect against spoofed packets. It can only protect from known bad source IPs. In that sense, it works like an access list, but more efficiently. 

Yes. And they probably are. No. Can't tell without seeing the L3 configuration, but unlikely. If you only access the managemnt interface from devices on VLAN 10, then no. If you want to access them from other VLANs, or from the Internet (via a VPN or something similar), then yes. Routers don't have egos, so they don't have to be number one ;) 

You're assuming the Ethernet header stays with the data from source to destination. The Ethernet header only exists on Ethernet links, and each different Ethernet link will have a different header. At every router hop, the layer 2 header (Ethernet) is removed, then the IP header is examined, the routing decision is made, and a new layer 2 header is added. If the layer 2 connection is Ethernet, then an Ethernet header is added. If it's Wi-fi, then an 802.11 header. Sonet, HDLC, etc. all have their own layer 2 headers. The Ethernet header you receive was added to the packet by the router closest to you. 

There are exceptions, but generally speaking, there is a one-to-one match between VLANs and subnets. In other words, for every VLAN, you have a subnet, and vice versa. So you would have two subnets (and two vlans) on each floor -- one for students and one for teachers. 

The "enable" command is a level 1 command. If you don't want your users to execute it, the simplest way is not to give them the password. Alternatively, you can configure command authorization, but that is significantly more complicated, especially with RADIUS. The if-authenticated command is used with authorization. It bypasses the authorization check. It's often used as a backup if the AAA server is unavailable. 

The simplest way would be to allow one PC to go directly to the Internet, bypassing the proxy, and then compare that to using the proxy. Make several connections to account for momentary congestion somewhere. Another idea: check the interface counters on your switches and look for output drops. Sometimes, perceived "slowness" while browsing the Internet is actually a DNS issue, where names are slow to resolve. You can try using an external nameserver (Google, for example) and see if that makes a difference. You say you don't have access to the proxy server. Ultimately, you will need to somehow get that administrator's cooperation if you are going to fully resolve this. 

I highlighted the important part. The receiver can be "smart" about sending acknowledgements and send them when it also has data to send, instead of sending the acknowledgement by itself. In other words, instead of the receiver saying "I received your last packet," it says "Here is my data to you, and I also received your last packet" The receiver sends one message instead of two. If the receiver has no data to send, then it sends the acknowledgement anyway when the timer expires. 

doesn't follow. The advantages of multicast are not for the switch. They are for the end hosts. End hosts can process multicast more efficiently than broadcast packets. The network interface card (NIC) on most hosts can be set to accept specific multicast addresses and reject all others, just as they do with unicast packets. So unwanted multicast traffic is ignored by the NIC as well as unwanted unicast traffic. But when the host receives a broadcast packet, it must accept it and send it to the CPU to process, even if it is not important to this host. In a network with lots of broadcast traffic, hosts are continually interrupted to process the broadcasts, even though they care about very few of them. Multicast solves this problem by "delegating" the task of selecting important packets to the NIC hardware. Only packets directly addressed to the host are sent to the CPU for processing. 

The default-class uses (by default) 50 percent of the available bandwidth. You can reduce that value as part of your policy-map. For example: 

Ethernet is a layer 2 protocol. It was originally designed for use in local area networks, but as the technology matured, other uses were found for it. Now it is used for some long-haul links. The protocol does not define whether a network is "local" or not. Internet providers do not exclusively use Ethernet, especially on long distance links. Finally, the definition of "local" is...well, there isn't a clear definition. Most would agree that your home network is a local network. Whether two connected nodes are "local" is dependent on the context. 

The idea is to have the cells overlap by 10-20% so that clients can roam smoothly. There are commercial products that help you do this and plot coverage maps onto floor plans. Some people like them, some don't. Here is a more detailed explanation. 

When you say error control, I think you are referring to error detection and correction. There are theoretical protocols and real-world protocols. In the real world (in the vast majority of networks you will encounter in 2018), the dominant data-link protocols are Ethernet (802.3) and Wi-Fi (802.11). There are still other WAN protocols used by large carriers, such as PoS, but their use is waning. Neither Ethernet nor WiFi have any error control, other than discarding corrupted frames (as @ronmaupin points out). If a frame is corrupted, it is simply dropped with no notification to the sender or receiver. It is up to higher level protocols to perform any error recovery. There are (or should I say were) some DL protocols that did do error detection, such as X.25, but these are essentially obsolete. As the reliability of networks has improved, they are no longer needed. I haven't seen them in over 20 years. But for all protocols, the layers are independent. DL protocols don't know what upper level protocols they are carrying, and upper level (like TCP) have no info on how the segments are transported. 

ARQ and CSMA/CA serve different purposes. ARQ (and similar mechanisms) ensure reliable communications, giving confirmation that data has been received correctly. Received packets are acknowledged by the receiver so that the sender knows they have in fact been received. CSMA/CA is a method of sharing a common media (radio channel) among multiple senders. It allows multiple, independent senders to use a media where only one sender can transmit at a time. Each sender waits until the media is idle before transmitting. And to answer your second question: Yes, that's the whole point. 

One option is to connect both switches together and create two vlans that span across both switches. Connect the routers and the WAN side of the FW to VLAN 1. Connect the LAN side and the servers to VLAN 2. If you run HSRP on the routers, that is your default gatewway for the firewall. Here is a logical diagram. Let me know if you need help configuring trunking on the switches. 

I would be tempted to make an RJ-11 pig tail, and then solder or twist the wires to the EPO cable. Heat shrink tubing over the whole thing to make it look "professional." 

To answer your question more directly, it is up to you, the sender, to decide what to call this condition. You can call it a 'timeout,' 'polling failure,' 'Device down' or something else. If you're looking for a diagnosis, you can't tell from just a lack of one ping response where the problem lies. You will need more information. 

Your VPN will still work, but there may possibly be some problems when passing large packets. The first 4 commands affect the maximum packet size and fragmentation. Depending on the MTU of your Internet connection, this may or may not be an issue. The SLA commands do not affect the VPN per se. However, they may be used to affect routing or some other operation. I can't tell with just the snippet you've provided. 

Cisco routers have a feature called Performance-based routing (PfR) that does exactly what you're looking for. 

The switch determines this during the listening phase. If no BPDUs are received during the listening phase, the switch knows it's an edge port. 

OSPF routers join specific multicast groups: 224.0.0.5 for all routers and 224.0.0.6 for DR/BDR routers. OSPF routers do not forward these multicasts -- they stay on the local link. I'm not quite sure I understand your second question. Multicasts have a specific range of Ethernet L2 addresses. Switches either 

EDIT: High speed adapters (1 Gb and above) do have special hardware to process TCP on the NIC itself, thereby saving CPU cycles. This is usually found on servers since they process more traffic than user workstations. "TCP offload" can be disabled through the adapter settings if it is causing application problems. 

You didn't read the full sentence. Here it is from Data Communications and Networking 5th edition by Behrouz A. Forouzan Page 526: 

When you say "unmanaged," I think you mean "default configuration." Yes, it works, but almost certainly not the way you would like it to. By default, all the ports are up and in a single VLAN (vlan 1). There is no routing enabled. You can type "show interfaces brief" to see the status of all the ports. You obviously have something more complex on your Dell switch. If you can let us know how the Dell switch is configured, we can come up with an equivalent for the HP. 

I don't know the exact model you are using, but the specs I read say 48V @.5A. That's 24 watts (and is more inline with similar APs) 23 ports @ 24W = 552 Watts. So, no, you can't power all the devices. Also don't forget to account for 50-75 watts for the switch itself. 

The best suggestion anyone can offer you is to hire a professional wireless installer that will perform a survey of your office space, determining the optimal location of access points. You can do it on the cheap with consumer grade products, but you won't be happy with the results. 

Where p is the probability of packet loss. For example, with a RTT of 50mS and a probability of 1E-4, you couldn't go faster than 230Mb (assuming an MSS of 1450). Here's a short explanation. 

Your teacher, unfortunately, has made an error. You can't "nest" or overlap subnets. In fact, many routers will not let you configure addresses this way -- they will give you an error because they don't know which interface to use for a given "nested" address. All your questions are good ones -- they point out the problems with trying to overlap subnets and why that won't work. I can say that the answer to 5 is No. 

The answer depends on what you're trying to do. If you don't create static routes, the link will not be used. By using static routes as you have, you have no redundancy in your network even though you have multiple paths to each network. This would be a good application for a routing protocol. 

The answer is incorrect (hey, it happens). You are right that 172 is 0x10101100. That was a mistake on their part. The 20 bits of host address, when added to the netid, give you all the addresses from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255. Honestly, IMO, they're making it more complicated than it needs to be. I've been doing this a long time and the only time I see things like "netid" is in textbooks. One more point: Address classes (A,B, C) were replaced by CIDR (The C stands for Classless), so it makes no sense to say it's a class B address. Furthermore all that happened in 1993 (I'm guessing before you were born), so address classes are very much obsolete. Yet, for some reason, they keep teaching it. 

This makes sense. The firewall is a better place to do the NAT functions, as it has more features and is is more flexible than a consumer grade router. I assume he intends to turn off NAT on the router (if he can). If not, double NAT is an unnecessary complication, but it will work anyway. Note that just because the "bridging LAN" has a private address, that does not mean the router has to do NAT.
