Up to Keynote' 06 the file was actually a folder 1 like you mentioned. However, later the format is used and this is a zip file. 2 ZIP files are not a good format to be diffed, but you can add unzip as a diff handler in git. You can also save the presentation in the old format. If svn still thinks the file is binary, you can use or . Files with no mime-type are treated as text files by subversion. 3 

Since you don't have control over you have to create a port forwarding on for every port you want access at PC B. On debian you should forward ports using . I have a similar setup with a opensuse machine that forwards RDP on over the VPN. This would be on . 

Problem The problem I have is that Windows seems to treat the desktop background in the same way as a directory background, so my custom contextmenu item is visible when I do right-click on the desktop background: I don't like this behavior, because this contextmenu item isn't useful when accesible from the desktop background, it only increases the size of the desktop contextmenu in general. 

The point is that the installer does not let you to decide which hidden components to install, and this way you can decide. For example I use this unattend.xml example, designed for Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate (for other version and/or edition is not compatible) which installs Visual Studio only with the required components to develop under VB.Net and C# with no unnecessary extra addons: 

Of course, since the internal subnet addresses of and are not given by the question, I can't give the exact routing information either. 

The first symbol is for normal key press, the second with shift. You can use xmodmap in your startup scripts. The symbol for is . Keycode for is on my (german) layout 94. You can find out what the keycode for your keys is with . It will open a small box and you see the keypress (and mouse) events in the terminal. 

Using systemctl rather than just should "more future proof", though. The order is important. _setup depends on _init. 

This script accepts , and and can be used in rc.d as a run-level script on is the VPN interface. This will disallow any traffic between the subnet and the VPN except for the ports explicitely opened (3389 in this example). You don't have to disallow all other forwarding, but I would recommend it. This will also forward access to to . 

Another way to restore the default , for both current user and machine user, is to use an useful application that I developed in .Net platform, with name PATHS. Usage would be: 

However, I'm not sure how to do it neither if that is really what I need. I tried to add a "ghost" item on the DesktopBackground registry key trying to override the original item that I have on Directory\Background key, but the item still shown when I do right-click on the desktop background: 

The problem I discovered is that due to the modifications I did, when I do right-click on a taskbar icon, this menu doesn't appears: 

When I access to my mail on the Outlook page, automatically it starts my session in Skype so in the Outlook page I can receive all the messages that the people send me via Skype, the problem is that I don't want that people can talk me from Skype if I'm just looking my new mails in the Outlook page... I have som clients in the Skype and when I have the Outlook page opened I can't notice most of the messages that they send me from Skype 'cause I'm not inside skype I just have the Outlook page opened to read or write mails... I don't want that Outlook starts session in Skype and receive private messages from they in silly notify popups in the Outlook page... 

(same as ) How to setup routing depends on the OS on the default gateway and your macbook. In general it works like this: On macbook (route to ): 

In general, maximizing the RAM is a good option for old PCs. Less general: having 512 MB of RAM is the absolute minimum these days. Using Windows XP, firefox and OpenOffice is most of the time enough to use all available RAM. How to find out if you need more RAM Open up the Task Manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL), and check the RAM usage. If there is not much free RAM left already, you really need to upgrade RAM. If this is not the case, start a couple of programs you might want to use (at the same time). If you still have a lot of free RAM left, then you don't need more RAM. If you say your machine starts lagging, then you quite probably need more RAM. Rationale RAM only makes your computer faster if it is used. If your system uses 2 GB of RAM at maximum, 4 GB will not make it any faster. However, if you have 512 MB of RAM and your programs would need 1 GB, then you start swapping/paging. That is: part of the Memory is written and read from hard disk. As the hard disk is a lot slower excessive swapping/paging can bring the whole machine to a crawl. So if you are out of RAM often, then more RAM is the first thing you should upgrade on your machine (or try using programs that use less RAM). 

Put the script file in the same folder as the source video, then run FFMPEG with the corresponding parameters. 

But if your purpose is to deploy a Windows ISO with a custom wallpaper set, then the prefered solution is to use WSIM (Windows System Image Manager) , which is included in the WAIK (Windows Automated Installation Kit) or also known as WADK (Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit), this way you can generate an AutoUnattend.xml file that should ship inside the ISO together the setup.exe file, this way you can modify a variety of default values when installing Windows, such as the default wallpaper for all users. 

In other words, I would like to use the same behavior as earlier versions of Windows, I won't use this cascade view. 

Hopefully server admins provide both types of fingerprints in the near future. EDIT: As given in the Arch Linux forums, there is also a third option: 

EDIT: You can generate the hash of an arbitrary key as given on the OpenSSH Cookbook: Retrieve the key: 

Previously the fingerprint was given as a hexed md5 hash. Starting with OpenSSH 6.8 the fingerprint is now displayed as base64 SHA256 (by default). You can't compare these directly. They also added a new configuration option . You can put 

This only works if there is no 192.168.. local subnet already present for the macbook! On the default gateway of (route to VPN over ): 

If you don't want to use port forwarding, you have to change the routing on somehow. If you don't have access to , then you need to route the traffic from the default gateway of to the VPN. One possibility is to route traffic for the VPN from the default gateway to . This only works if you use a different subnet at the location of the macbook than the one used between and If you use some type of router with your macbook you probably also have a 192.168.. subnet there. For this setup you don't use the previous script. You still need 

This batch file could help you. It finds all the "Drawings" subfolders, it tokenizes the parts of the directory paths to construct the new directory struct, then copies each found directory with subdirectories using RoboCopy tool. VERY IMPORTANT: 

Research I tested a lot of 3rd party applications but any of them has convinced me, because all has very bad inconvenients. I know ShellFolderFix, which can be downloaded here: $URL$ ... But ShellFolderFix its more a troublemaker than a fix, because it has a annonying bug that causes the current Explorer window to "randomly" move over the screen. I describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it here: $URL$ Then, ShellFolderFix or other window managers are not an option for me, I'm asking for a proper solution that does not involves the usage in background of those kind of applications. Update I heard that the build 10525 of Windows 10, which seems it was released on 12/October/2015, it fixes the cascade view. However, it is an Insider Preview and I cannot find the ISO in my native language, in Spanish.
