Take note that I'm using Box2D for the Java programming version thanks to LibGDX via Box2D engine and I edited the physics body using Physics Body Editor before I implement it to code. I tried to check every available methods for body, fixture definition, or body definition to code for the SFX when hit but it seems only for the gravity and weight. Is there possibly available on the document for SFX played when collision happens if possible? 

I have a question about using Box2D (engine for LibGDX used to make realistic physics). I observed on the code that I've made for the physics here below: 

I was planning to name each weapon at the weapon shop and I was wondering if it is safe to use the real name of each weapon and model as well before publishing it via Google Play Store for my created game app? I'm using a freemodel method with ad banner on menu on it, user friendly. I'm making a concept third-person shooter zombie survival game. I'm checking some other sample of the games, (other than from mobile app) one from the gamer console's classic in PlayStation 1 game Syphon Filter; and the other one from the PC, a popular online FPS game created by Korea called CrossFire. Let's take a comparison's similar of the gun (both gun model name and the model itself) used between these two: 

First class is the first screen. Fade animation works on the company's logo. Second class is the second screen. Fade animation for the loading screen works. Third class is the third screen. After the second screen, now calls for the third screen. Animation stopped or won't run since I want the black screen to fade out at the start when the menu is here. 

Is it possible that if I'm making a a simple drag-n-drop game, does making a new sprite via constructor with texture as a parameter makes the game slower and depletes more memory until it crashes or does making a new texture via constructor cause the memory to go slow? I'm on a revision for the new drag-n-drop puzzle game where the only goal is to stack the most no. of objects as you can before it falls off the platform. Is it a good idea to create another sprite with texture as a parameter every time a player drag-n-drop another object? Here's the start of the dry run looked like and I set it to debug mode so that the platform is completely block the pit to test the replication test. 

I was thinking about how does the Angry Bird game for the iOS successfully converted into an Android compatible version. Does it involve using Phonegap or something? When making games for iOS, the programmer preferred XCode. For Android game app, the programmer preferred Eclipse IDE and a LibGDX engine library. Because of this, like Angry Birds for example, this game became compatible for the iOS, Android, and even on the desktop computer. The question is...how does it work? 

Now, when I tried the suggested code for aspect ratio, the perfect circle retained but another problem is occured. The problem is that I expecting for a view on center but instead it's been moved to the right offset leaving with a half black screen. This would be look like this: 

My boss invited me and assigned me now as publisher for the app in Google Play. I have a 7-inch Google Nexus 7 tablet to take screenshot of any one of my sample projects I've made and post and upload it into the 7-inch screenshot section. Now, I want to take some screenshots and post it this time into the 4-inch screenshot section. However, I got a 4.5-inch smartphone that runs on Android ICS. I was wondering. Is it valid if I posted on the 4-inch screenshot section using all my snapshots taken from the 4.5-inch screenshot image or there is a specific requirement for that like the width and height in pixels? 

So tell me, did I made something wrong in this touchDown() code or not? I have observed something here after I run in debug mode. 

I want to know more further if it is safe to use the model name only but not mentioning the corporation name who created the AK-47. Naming a gun could be striking, same thing naming the actor of the game. If not, probably if it is also okay to name close to the original but at least it's not against the copyright standards. 

Is there a way on how to stay the texts in center without manually coding it or something, especially when making an update? I'm making a display for the highest score. Let's say that the score is 9. However, if the score is 9,999,999, the text displays still only at the fixed X and Y coordinate. Is there really a way to stay the text in center especially when there is changes when a player beats the new world record? Here's my code inside Sprite Batch: 

I have a shared Google Play Developer account so that he allowed me to publish a game app. Next, I want to know if in order to test the online highscore is to upload the APK and publish it first before adding a new game at the Game Services section. One thing, according to this link and this link on setting up Google Play Services, these tutorials on implementing code for the leaderboard is possibly applied on the Manifest. Is it still the same in Unity if I added the lib folder onto the plugins folder of the Unity project and how? 

Normally, a physics frame in pink (see image below) gives the body for detecting hit signal. It usually either falls down or lifts up depending on the gravity orientation. The question is: Is it possible to move or manipulate sprite through X and Y coordinate without needing to use the gravity code from a physics engine like bodyeditor-loader-sources.jar (e.g. ) so that I can move simply either by dragging, change the value initially, or moving it by D-pad? 

I'm planning to make a video-based splash screen for the simple game app for Android under client's cigarette brand project. I was thinking if can this video file type, AVI, run on Android or not? Please suggest me. 

I am making a program that pick, drag, and drop the ball. In real life, once you pick the ball and drop it, whenever the available object is (what you see is what you get) will only be picked and dropped again and again. However, in the game program, there is something that at first you did pick and drop the ball. When you did the second time, something hit like some sort of an "invisible object" and the physics frame (in pink) is replicating while the frame in green is the wall and the floor. Take a look at these pictures. Before picking up and drop a ball for the first time... 

Was this code useful for screen aspect ratio-proportion fixing or it is statically dependent on actual device's width and height? **see $URL$ 

Do you have any reasons why my tween code didn't run or work? I already add the tween engine onto the library folder under LibGDX project folder and "Order and Export" it under Java Build Path at the Properties menu. My first two classes ran correctly and workly but my third class didn't work. Here's the sequence: 

Before making game apps, I want to have any certain smartphone device brands that runs on OpenGL. I have to make a code for images that doesn't need to required power of 2 images so that I can resize the images independently from the start. However, some images appeared in white instead of the appearance that I expected like the old model phone T-Mobile on Android 1.6 for example after I disabled the power of 2 code. The only device I've known that worked and displayed image sprites properly is the Google Nexus 7. Can you tell me either other phone models that can display images without the need of power of 2 and will not display white images instead? Please give me an example at least. Thank you.
