Gap Theorem - Any set that is NP-complete under $AC^0$ reductions is NP-complete under $NC^0$ reductions. Stop Gap Theorem - There is a set that is NP-complete under $AC^0[\!\!\mod 2]$ reductions, but not under $AC^0$ reductions. 

If your FSM is a DFA, then this is the Minimum Consistent DFA Problem, which is well known in the machine learning community. This problem is NP complete Gold1978 - Complexity of Automaton Identification from Given Data. The problem is also known to be hard to approximate within any polynomial factor. Indeed it is even hard to find an NFA whose number of states is an approximation of the number of states of a minimum consistent DFA. Pitt-Warmuth-1993 - The minimum consistent DFA problem cannot be approximated within any polynomial. There are many known heuristics and algorithms for tackling this problems. A well studied algorithm is due to Angluin. Angluin-1987 - Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples 

An identical homomorphism characterization of DCFL does not seem to be possible. The following is extracted from Greibach's original paper. 

If I understand correctly your questions are answered in Agrawal-Allender-Impagliazzo-Pitassi-Rudich-2001: Reducing the Complexity of Reductions 

Indeed, using the resultss in Elberfeld-Jakoby-Tantau-2010 one can show that SAT can be decided in logspace on formulas whose incidence graph has bounded treewidth. Here is a sketch of how the main steps of the proof of this claim go. 

Below, MSO denotes the monadic second order logic of graphs with vertex-set and edge-set quantifications. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a minor closed family of graphs. It follows from Robertson and Seymour's graph minor theory that $\mathcal{F}$ is characterized by a finite list $H_1,H_2,...,H_k$ of forbidden minors. In other words, for each graph $G$, we have that $G$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if $G$ excludes all graphs $H_i$ as minors. As a consequence of this fact, we have an MSO formula $\varphi_{\mathcal{F}}$ which is true on a graph $G$ if and only if $G\in \mathcal{F}$. For instance, planar graphs are characterized by the absence of the graphs $K_{3,3}$ and $K_5$ as minors, and therefore it is easy to write explicitly an MSO formula characterizing planar graphs. The problem is that for many nice minor closed graph properties, the list of forbidden minors is unknown. So, while we know that an MSO formula characterizing that family of graphs exist, we may not know what this formula is. On the other hand, it may be the case that one is able to come up with an explicit formula for a given property without using the graph minor theorem. My question is related to this possibility. Question 1: Is there a minor closed family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, such that the set of forbidden minors is not known, but some MSO formula $\varphi$ characterizing that set of graphs is known? Question 2: Is some explicit MSO formula $\varphi$ known to characterize some of the following properties? 

There are several interesting classes of graphs with bounded treewidth. For instance, trees (treewidth 1), series parallel graphs (treewidth 2), outerplanar graphs (treewidth 2), $k$-outerplanar graphs (treewidth O(k)), graphs of branchwidth $k$ (treewidth O(k)),... Question: Are there examples of interesting classes of graphs whose treewidth is not bounded by a constant, but by a low-growing function? 

The paper 7 is the conference version of the paper. In the conference version, Theorem 4.2 states that "The family of deterministic context-free languages is not a principal AFDL". However some analogue characterization may still be possible. Okhotin provided homomorphic characterizations of conjunctive and Boolean grammars. For DCFL's the problem seems to be open. The following is the conclusion of Okhotin's paper (from 2013). 

Answering half of Samir's question. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a DAG and $V_1,V_2\subseteq V$ be two subsets of vertices of $G$. We denote by $E(V_1,V_2)$ the set of all edges in $G$ with one endpoint in $V_1$ and other endpoint in $V_2$. If $\omega = (v_1,...,v_n)$ is a total ordering of the vertices of $G$ then we let $$\mathbf{ow}(G,\omega) = \max_{i}\; |E(\{v_1,...,v_i\},\{v_{i+1},...,v_n\}|$$ denote the width of $\omega$. The online width of $G$ is defined as $$\mathbf{ow}(G) = \min_{\omega}\; \mathbf{ow}(G,\omega),$$ where the minimum is taken over all topological orderings of the vertices of $G$. Note that the traditional notion of cutwidth of $G$, $\mathbf{cw}(G)$ is defined analogously, except that the minimum is taken over all possible orderings of $G$, irrespectively of whether the ordering is topological or not. We have the following sequence of inequalities: $$\mathbf{tw}(G) \leq \mathbf{pw}(G) \leq \mathbf{cw}(G)\leq \mathbf{ow}(G),$$ where $\mathbf{pw}(G)$ and $\mathbf{tw}(G)$ are respectively the pathwidth and the treewidth of $G$. We claim that MAJORITY of $n$ bits can be computed in online-width $O(\log n)$, and therefore in treewidth $O(\log n)$. The circuit simulates an online algorithm that reads one input bit $b$ at a time and adds $b$ to a counter with $O(\log n)$ bits if and only if $b=1$. At the beggining, the counter is initialized to $0$. At the end the circuit accepts if and only if the value of the counter is greater than n/2. It is easy to see that the gates of a circuit ADD that adds one to the counter register can be topologically-ordered in such a way that it has constant online width, since this circuits just need to implement an carry on operation. The total circuit is a sequence of circuits $C=(ADD_1,ADD_2,...,ADD_n,COMP)$ where the output of $ADD_i$ is plugged to the input of $ADD_{i+1}$, and the output of $ADD_n$ is plugged to the input of COMP. Now if we topologically-order the total circuit $C$ in such a way that all gates of $ADD_i$ appear before the gates of $ADD_{i+1}$ and all gates of $ADD_n$ appear before the gates of COMP, then this topological order has online width $O(\log n)$. This construction is illustrated in Figure 1 of a paper of mine to show that probability amplification can be done in logarithmic online width. Obs: The depth of the circuit C is $O(n)$. 

If I'm not mistaken your question was answered by Chen-Thurley-Weyer-2008 modulo parameterized complexity assumptions. I didn't read the paper carefully yet, but as far as I understood, there is a dichotomy in the sense that if $C$ is finite then the problem is in $P$, but if $C$ has an infinite number of graphs then the induced subgraph isomorphism is $W[1]$ complete (Corollary 4, page 6). Thus it seems that unless the first level $W[1]$ of the $W$ hierarchy collapses to $FPT$, there is no such an infinite class of graphs whose induced subgraph isomorphism is in $P$. There is another interesting result stating that if $P\neq NP$ then there are classes for which the induced isomorphism is neither in $P$ nor $NP$ complete. 

I'm looking for the correct name of geometric structures obtained as follows. 2-structures: A collection $X$ of triangles is a $2$-structure. If $X$ is a $2$-structure and $Y$ is obtained from $X$ by gluing two free edges belonging to triangles in $X$, then $Y$ is a $2$-structure. 3-structures: A collection $X$ of tetrahedra is a $3$-structure. If $X$ is a $3$-structure and $Y$ is obtained from $X$ by gluing two free triangles belonging to tetrahedra in $X$, then $Y$ is a $3$-structure. k-structures: A collection $X$ of $k$-simplices is a $k$-structure. If $X$ is a $k$-structure and $Y$ is obtained from $X$ by gluing two free (k-1)-simplices belonging to $k$-simplices in $X$, then $Y$ is a $(k-1)$-structure. Alternatively, a $k$-structure can be non-inductively defined as a homogeneous simplicial k-complex $X$, satisfying the following conditions. 

Wormald has shown that if $G$ is a connected $3$-regular graph with 2n vertices then the number of automorphisms of $G$ divides $3n\cdot 2^n$. In particular this gives a non-trivial exponential upper-bound for the $3$-regular case. Maybe there are results in this line for general $k$-regular graphs. For a lower bound, consider formula $F$ with $n$ inputs whose gates are addition $\mod k$ gates of fan-in 2. Then using a resut of Toran one can construct a $k$-regular graph $G(F)$ with $O(k^2\cdot n)$ vertices whose automorphism group encodes all possible evaluations of $F$. This implies that the number of automorphisms of $G(F)$ is at least $k^n$. This shows that the there is an exponential lower bound for the number of automorphisms of $k$-regular graphs in function of its number of vertices. 

Is there an algorithm for this problem that is polynomial in $|P|$ and $n$? Here $n$ is given in unary. An algorithm running in time $n^{f(k)}|P|^{g(k)}$ would be fine. Or is this problem NP-complete?
