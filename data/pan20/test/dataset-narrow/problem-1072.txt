Following these recommendations is a good start, though it really depends on your setup and what you want to do with the system every day. Disabling things like network discovery and any sort of software your printer might've come with is a good start as well, though if those are applications you use frequently, YMMV. 

See the question - if I want to build the latest version of an app from the source, am I doomed to checking for updates manually? Is there a better way to do this? 

Like Stefan mentioned, this is most likely a problem with each individual messaging application. Try installing a multi-protocol client like Pidgin and see if you have success with that - otherwise, take a look at the password storing options on each other app. 

Yes - you can use Partition Magic or the like to do this. Defragmenting your drive first should give you a bit more space at the end of the drive to work with. 

Usually, the derived work is just the piece (image) itself. If you're using other content from the page as well, then it would apply to the entire page. If your site is based around the image, you might have more trouble than if the image is just there to complement your existing content. Of course, it would be best to consult a lawyer. 

If you can copy all of the data into one sheet, you can use the 'remove duplicates' (under Data) to find unique addresses. If you colour-code the entries from each file first, you'll be able to tell which came from where, and which ones are left over. Edit: If you used background colours to code the entries, you can use this function to count the entries. If you coloured the font, you can use this function, taking care to replace 'Interior' with 'Font' as noted in the explanation at the top. 

Let's say I have a Mac with 128GB of RAM and no SSD. Could I somehow configure OSX to use the RAM as an SSD, i.e. as part of a Fusion Drive? Note: manually making a Fusion Drive is described here: $URL$ 

Is there a package for getting an accurate reading on the current total battery power usage in Watts on any system? 

In Dropbox on OSX, I have a local folder that I have shared with another Dropbox user, Bob. Previously, I put some files in this folder, and Bob got them synced on his PC. Just now, I ACCIDENTALLY put some other files in that folder, which I under no circumstances want Bob to see. Realizing my mistake, I immediately removed them from this local folder; some of them had already uploaded, but not all. I then promptly logged onto dropbox.com and removed Bob from this shared folder, just to be sure. Question 1: If Bob's PC was turned off when I did this, is there any chance he will see the files? Question 2: If Bob's PC was turned on when I did this, is there any chance he will see the files? 

I was sent here from Photography Stack Exchange. I'm looking for a portable hard drive enclosure (2.5" notebook) that plugs into an SD card slot and LOOKS like an SD card to the camera. The obvious advantage being unlimited space for video recording. But where it really comes in handy (and crucial) is when you factor in how long it takes to transfer a giant multi-GB video file from the camera's SD card to a hard drive. As far as I can tell, the fastest possible setup maxes at about 20MB/s. (Similar to how Eye-Fi works) 

In general, my back button works fine, as does everything else in Safari. But there is one webpage (an online quiz for a class) which opened in a popup window, I filled in my responses, hit the submit button, and then it told me my session is expired. In this window, the keyboard shortcut for Back doesn't do anything and right-clicking on the page gives a context menu with Forward but not Back. Is there any way for me to go Back to see my long hard work of entering responses in the form on the previous page? 

What you're looking for is the Avant Window Navigator (awn) - the link has instructions for gutsy, but they should apply equally to new distributions as well! 

Probably the easiest option would be to have it publish a snapshot every x minutes or hours to a website, which you could then control with some sort of password-based authentication. Accessing the camera directly will be much more difficult and probably not worth the hassle if all you need to do is check your mail. 

I just keep a headphone jack adapter plugged in when I'm in public places, so the volume is effectively muted and there's no disturbance. 

Try the steps in this link, but choose Thunderbird as the program instead of GMail. If that doesn't work, can you click on regular mailto: links? I believe the issue is with the handling of mailto: - Windows doesn't know that there's a program able to handle it. 

There's an extension called Leak Monitor that monitors add-ons for a certain type of memory leak...not exactly what you're looking for, but it's a start! 

If you're worried about RSI, a trackball is definitely the way to go. They're a little difficult to get used to, but you'll notice a difference really quickly. 

I've used SUPER and had good results, but some people are leery that it might be a bit suspicious (so, be careful and make you're you're only downloading from the developer's site). It's basically a front-end to the ffmpeg library, which can do anything and everything video-related. 

PDF Split and Merge is a tool I've had great success with, and it comes in GUI and command-line flavours. If the command-line version is anything like the GUI, you should have no problem scripting a solution. 

It sounds like this is probably an accessibility 'feature', but I can't find anything specific about what you're experiencing on the page (here). I think you'll want to look along those lines, though. 

I'm looking for a "one-click" way of taking ANY PDF and converting it to plain text. Ideally on OSX or Linux. Ideally, the solution would include OCR functionality, but it need not necessarily. The top priority is having something that can take ANY file WITHOUT configuration. 

OSX 10.6 includes the ability to show a "preview" of PPT files by selecting a file in Finder and hitting Cmd-Y. But in this preview, I cannot select text to copy and paste, and I cannot print or save in a different format. Is there an app for OSX that simply converts PPTs to PDFs? 

Question: How can I add power to a USB cable without using a USB hub? ... Background: I have a USB device that runs on bus power. I don't know how much bus power it requires (I googled). When I plug it into my Macbook Pro, it works. When I plug it into my iPad Camera Connection Kit, it doesn't work. Googling confirms that this device needs more bus power than provided is by iPad, but people say they have made the device work with iPad by using a powered USB hub. So I bought a USB cable that has two male A connectors and one male B connector; the cable is marketed for connecting USB hard drives that require extra power: one male A has power and data lines, the other male A has only power lines. I tried that cable with my iPad and USB device and it doesn't work; the device doesn't light up any of its LEDs. 

Secondly, what if I'm printing nothing but full-page photos? Obviously, the "coverage" required by a photo will VARY WIDELY; one might be almost entirely white. But is there an INDUSTRY STANDARD AVERAGE for what percent coverage is required to print a full-page photo?
