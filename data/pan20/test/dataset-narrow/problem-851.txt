In the first case: Your user has a local profile only, when he logs on computer A for the first time, the profile is created, and when this user logs on computer B for the first time, another profile is created (in C:\users) The profile is not stored anywhere else because nothing instructs Windows to do so. In the second case: The roaming profile is downloaded (or created if it's the first logon) on the computer (in c:\users) from the fileshare, when the user logs off, the downloaded profile is merged with the profile on the fileshare. In the third case: In this case, you chose to map a network drive for the user, when the session is opened, Windows does nothing more than mapping the wanted drive letter to the folder on the fileshare. So, your question is, why the profile is not directly mapped on the fileshare/drive letter but remains in c:\users ? Because there would be a lot of performance issues, there is a lot of activity in the user's profile: the current user's registry is stored on that folder, imagine if this was on the network share, there would be a huge latency when enumerating the current user's registry (for example). And what happens if the network connection is lost ? No more Desktop ? A lot of applications will wait on countless timeouts because the user's profile is unavailable (AppData is in the user's profile too, a lot of applications use this location to store user-specific settings) Howver, don't forget that you can use Folder Redirections, for example to redirect the user's Documents folder on the network share that you want. 

If the value of this registry key is 0, can you try to set "Allow New Connections" to True, then to False again and check this registry key value again ? It should be 1 (but don't change it manually in the registry !) There is a bug in the management interfaces (either Server Manager or PowerShell cmdlet), if you set this value to False before adding your RDSH to a collection, then this value is not honored. 

You can use the same port number, but you must enable the option called "Requier Server Name Indication" in the Binding of your website and enter the hostname : 

In the "General" tab, can you check "Run only when user is logged on" please ? This is an issue, and the GUI shouldn't let you check "Run whether user is logged on or not" when you select the System account but there is a bug in this GPP UI. However, since the System account is selected, your task will run even if nobody is logged on. 

Don't forget to remove "Autenticated Users" from the security filtering, because all your users AND computers are in "Autenticated Users". If you don't remove "Authenticated Users", even if you add your groups in the security filtering, they will not filter anything at all... 

If you changed the group membership for this user, you have to logoff/logon again and then group membership will be updated. However, the "MemberOf" tab doesn't display nested groups. If your user is member of Group1, and Group1 is member of Group2, you will not see Group2 in the MemberOf tab, but Group2 will be listed in GPResult. 

This setting is not available in the Power Plan GPP. However, you can change this value (videoconlock) by using the following command: for AC power: 

You can change the local security policy settings (run secpol.msc, or create a GPO) Go to Security Setting -> System Services and open the properties of the service. Then, you can change permission as desired. service.msc uses elevated privileges, but the prompt is not shown since UAC is set on "level 3" and not 4 on your computer: 

When you change the PATH variable by using the control panel, when you click "OK", the control panel sends a WM_SETTINGCHANGE message to all the opened windows, so they know that the environments variables has been changed. So, if you don't want to logoff, you must send WM_SETTINGCHANGE yourself by creating/finding a little program that sends this message according to the documentation: $URL$ 

An Active Directory user account, but without configuring a roaming profile An Active Directory user account, with a roaming profile An AD user account with a home folder mapped (by GPO or via the user's properties) 

The attributes can't contain any logic, they have to be populated by "something else". In fact, you can see Active Directory (or at least, the part we are talking about here) as a database, with fields and records, and when you extend the schema, you add more "fields" to this database. In order for you to populate your newly created attribute, you can create a little program, or a PowerShell script that will gather the required information (the event ID that you mentioned for example), process this information, and then write the attribute in your AD. 

This message says that you must assign a static IP address on your DHCP Server. You can use the following procedure: $URL$ 

Yes, you can install and configure the Active Directory Domain Services without installing the DNS role. However, if you want to use your own DNS infrastructure, you will have to manually configure it according to the documentation: $URL$ DHCP is a completely separated role and has noting to do with AD so you can use another DHCP server if you want. 

Don't try to run Configuration Manager Client if you are not using SCCM. You will not be able to do anything with it because CCM Client needs a SCCM server. 

You should use Process Monitor and perform a boot trace (Options -> Enable Boot Logging) or start process monitor from another account in the computer and while the capture is running, log on with the user's account and then stop the capture. You will be able to see the process tree (Tools -> Process Tree) so you will be able to see "who" launched Word. 

AppLocker is available only for the "Enterprise" editions of Windows. You need Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10 Enterprise to use AppLocker. $URL$ Adding to that, you shouldn't edit the Default Domain Policy to enforce AppLocker, you should create a separate GPO. 

It will also disable Win+L and the computer won't be locked after the monitor times out for example. 

and this string is processed by the broker, so the client will be redirected accordingly (MS Terminal Services Plugin.1.... is a value used and processed internally) The "problem" here, is that the RDP setting is not really documented by Microsoft, it can change at anytime... You should be ready to change the whole value very quickly if you rely on your own RDP file for use in production. You noticed that there is the collection name in the , be careful, this is not necessarily the name of the collection as displayed in the management console! You can try if you want: from a certain length, this value is truncated. My advice is to use only official RDP files, generated by the Remote Desktop Web Portal (RDWeb) or be ready to respond quickly when a change occurs in the contents of the RDP file (Microsoft can change the loadbalanceinfo, for example, tomorrow with a Windows Update if they want) 

What I would do is set an auto-logon in the VM with a generic user for your tests, and create an executable (or a script) that you would add in one of the auto-start location of Windows for example. This little program will contact a web service by passing the VM name as a parameter in the request, then, the web service will output a list of tasks, or a command to start in your VM. Then you can create a management tool to create the relationship between the VMs and the "tasks". If you don't want to create a webservice, you can simply put text files or PowerShell scripts in a file share (the file name would be the VM name for example) and you just have to start/read the corresponding file when the VM starts. 

Your task is scheduled to run with the System account, but the clipboard is per user. You need to create a scheduled task that runs within the user context and only when the user is logged on. I created a scheduled task with the following script and it works:
