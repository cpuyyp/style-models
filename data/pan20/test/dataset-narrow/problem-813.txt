After a few minutes I wised up and thought to look at the isolinux.cfg file from the DBAN ISO. The only option after append that is common on all of them is 'nuke="dwipe"'. I put that option in place and the application loaded properly. 

Looking at the man page for either mail or sendmail has not clued me into which option I need to use. I did see in the sendmail manpage that there is the -O option which uses the option=value format. I tried that instead of the -S listed above. Still no dice. The manpage even says the -O option is ignored. Can someone help me out with this? 

When I created the kickstart file I had the directive uncommented. It failed but I did not think to look at the details so I don't know why. The Red Hat knowledgebase article omitted this directive so I commented it out. The issue persisted. That said, now that it is again uncommented and allowed to be executed as part of the kickstart it is working. So, since I didn't look at the details when I first encountered this error I don't know what the problem originally was. 

I have a functioning PXE configuration that allows to boot to an installation by Kickstart or rescue, both via RHEL6 media. I'm trying to add DBAN to the mix to make for a more complete solution for our needs. I have it set up to boot and it will load, but it keeps failing with 

I'm trying to figure out how to get some of our servers to send email through our relay when I use the mail command. If I simply type 

I just installed RHEL 7.1 on a server. I'm using it to study for the RHCSA/RHCE exams. One of the steps in the study guide is to install a VM through using installation media on an FTP server. The OS variant list only goes up to RHEL 7.0. I attempted to install 7.1 but it threw an error every time: 

I've also tried without the root= or init= options with the same result. I'm not even entirely sure about those options. Not much that I've found online gives much detail or explanation. One thing I know for sure, is that right now I don't want to enable the autonuke option. I simply want to load up the interactive method. Has anyone been able to make this work? EDIT: Potentially pertinent information The server that I'm testing this on (and, in fact, 99% of our servers) are VMs running on VMware ESXi. The CD works when I attach it as an ISO to the VMware console and boot to it. 

I'm disabling on a RHEL6 server and enabling . In the file I have commented out the line and replaced it with . Unfortunately, this leaves the message hanging on a command prompt instead displaying the message and then dropping to a new prompt. I've tried and added a newline at the end of the string, but that still won't present a new prompt after displaying the message. I've tried using to simply send the message to STDOUT, but that does not display anything at all. A simple solution would be to add text indicating that the user needs to press Enter to return to a prompt, but I'd prefer this happen on its own. How do I echo a message and then return to a prompt? 

In most LDAP servers, the password is stored in the directory the server is hosting. I think it would be easiest to store the passwords in LDAP and authenticate RADIUS and everything else against LDAP. However, e.g. OpenLDAP supports SASL, so you can authenticate LDAP against something else, typically Kerberos. 

Xen is being given a quite cold treatment these days, everyone seems to be migrating to KVM. That said, neither of those two is good at desktop virtualization IMHO. I prefer KVM for server virtualization and VirtualBox for desktop virtualization. 

It seems to me lie the passdb passwd-file { ... } block or maybe a similar userdb block is having precedence over the passdb ldap block 

According to $URL$ it is important to align the virtual hard drives of virtual machines for performance. I'm running virtual machines in an environment built on Debian, KVM and LVM. What steps should be taken to get alignment right when installing a host node? How can the alignment be checked on an already installed node? Can the alignment be altered without re-installation? How? 

in /etc/ldap/ldap.conf. This will prevent checking of the certificate. Note that it makes the connection even less secure. /etc/ldap.conf should not affect ldapsearch(1) Also try dropping the second -Z on the command line. That might be what's forcing the fail even though you have TLS_REQCERT allow. 

A router has a routing table filled with information about where to send packets. If it's a simple home router, it probably has two entries; local network (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) is directly connected on LAN interface and everything else is sent via the default route on the WAN interface to the gateway address (next hop), which is a router managed by the ISP. The routing table can be filled manually if they are as simple as this example, or by running some routing protocol like BGP or OSPF, that talks to the peers and computes the contents of the routing table. 

In addition to ionice(1) rsync might be pushing blocks needed by mysql out from disk cache. You can patch rsync with fadvise support to avoid putting the stuff read by rsync into cache. 

We use DRBD at work. It works pretty well, but we only use it in a two node configuration. I wouldn't really consider it for anything more complicated. 

The problem is that everyone has a slightly different idea of what is the perfect setup. We use Puppet for configuring new nodes and there are some reusable puppet modules in puppet forge, but we usually end up customizing them. I've been meaning to write an article about setting up puppet, but real work prevents me from progressing. 

Sounds like you want a VPN connection/tunnel between servers 1 and 2. And then a reverse proxy (nginx/apache/haproxy/varnish/...) on server1 that forwards all requests over the tunnel to server2. 

The documentation states that the directories under SVNParentPath have to be repositories, so no looking through all subdirectories. You might be able to make script though, that would output several Location-blocks matching the parent folders of SVN repositories. 

Each of the IPs in the setting is one of the slaves. Example slave. Again, there are several more zones but they are identical save for the domain. 

I've verified via that I am able to connect to the slaves from the master via port 53. EDIT 2 One thing I've done is to ensure that all of the slaves have the same configuration as well as fixing the logging which was misconfigured. About three hours after I modified the zone file the transfer happened. I still can't sort out why it isn't happening immediately. Below is the master . There are several more zone entries, but they are all identical with the exception of the domain. 

I have a PXE menu configuration that I'm working on. It incorporates the RHEL6 Rescue option in order to perform repairs after booting from the network. The Rescue boot environment asks three basic questions to set itself up: Language, Keymap, and source for the rescue image. I have the first two sorted by adding the "lang=" and "keymap=" options to the "append" line in the PXE menu: 

I've also explicitly set despite it being enabled by default. Additionally, I've removed the option on the master to ensure that all hosts are able to dynamically update. Replication still isn't occurring. I am, however, seeing that the master is sending the NOTIFY announcements: 

We've recently gone through a security audit and among several valid and other, quite pointless findings is one that states that tcpwrappers is not disabled. I've never used tcpwrappers so I don't have a great deal of experience in how it is configured. Having said that I've always been under the impression that it isn't simply disabled or enabled like a daemon. Instead, rules are created which define services that use it and which servers are and are not allowed to access the service. By default, if nothing is defined then tcpwrappers is, effectively, disabled. Am I wrong? 

We statically assign our routes using the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-ethx files. This makes managing them fairly easy since we add the routes during the kickstart process (by way of post-script). They rarely change and if they need to be updated we simply push out a change and update the build scripts to include the new route. Recently, we had a customer ask for a virtual interface (eth0:0) with a unique IP. It needs to connect exclusively to one network. The first assigned IP on eth0 will handle all other traffic. Everything I've seen states how to add a route using , however I can't sort out how to specify that anything going to a particular IP or network can have the source IP set. If I use the ip command will it update the route files or is it stored elsewhere for persistence across reboots? If I have to add the entry to the route file for eth0:0 what should the line look like? So basically: If it goes to 10.0.0.2 use IP 10.0.1.3 as the source. If it goes anywhere else use IP 10.0.1.2 as the source. Is this possible? How do I accomplish it? 

Directory / refers to the root directory of the server. Try Location / to refer to the URL specific to the virtualhost. 

I've had some success with using bcache to combine ssd and hdd as the backing device for btrfs. The cache hit ratio varies by workload, but can be quite nice and can be monitored via /sys/fs/bcache 

Yes. As long as you use TCP connections and not UNIX sockets. Make sure to encrypt the connections if there is any sensitive data. Or use a VPN. 

Does rvm somehow link to the active ruby instance? That is, is there some sort of symlink called that points to whatever the active version happens to be? If so, then allow sudo for . Otherwise write a wrapper script (not in shell, but perl or python) that picks the right version and allow people to run that using sudo. 

Analyze the traffic of the other VPN software. Use tcpdump or wireshark or something similar. Don't guess, look. 

Check out what AnandTech has to say about SSDs. They seem to have understood their strengths and weaknesses right from the beginning. I'm still guessing that Intel X-25E is a safe bet, but maybe not the ultimate choice. 

Hard-links can be very useful when you want to have the same contents (and same permissions!) in several files on the same filesystem. Take for example a package manager, that creates a /usr/share/doc/$packagename directory for each package that is installed and inside that directory a file called LICENSE with the license information of the package. Many packages on a typical Linux system are GPL licensed, so instead of having 200 copies of the GPL on the filesystem there could be only one copy and 199 links. Distributed version control systems copy the whole repository on clone, there is no checkout like in svn. If several clones of the same repository are on the same filesystem they can share part of the (immutable) files by using hard links (git does this, and darcs too IIRC). Many backup solutions also use hardlinks, like rsnapshot and backuppc. 

Yes, you can absolutely resize the existing partition. Just make sure that the new/resized partition starts from the same location. After that (and rebooting, so that Linux recognizes the new size of the in-use partition) run pvresize on the PV and after that vgs or vgdisplay should show more space. 

sudo is really the better alternative here. If you are afraid that they can pass arguments to other than /, maybe create two small binaries (not scripts!) that do nothing other than call / (and not using but ) and only enable calling those two specific binaries for the user. 

There's (8) which can be used to select the boot entry if you're using . If you're not using the default is which boots the first defined kernel. Usually the kernels are ordered from latest to oldest in order to boot into the latest kernel. 

Take a look at the Linux Terminal Server Project. With X11, you should be able to run an X11 server (the part of X11 that draws stuff on the screen) on your netbook and whatever X11 clients (firefox, libreoffice, almost anything, really, except software that needs direct access to hardware (OpenGL) or pushes a lot of stuff over from the client to server (video?)) you wish on your server, displaying their windows on your netbook.
