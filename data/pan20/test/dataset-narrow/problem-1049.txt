Update: You may also be referring to which are highlighted with a foreground of teal () and a background of aqua (). 

If you take a look at the .theme files in , you can find the wallpaper referenced under . The root folder for these wallpapers is: . Note: will generally be . 

The Windows 7 Home Premium EULA does not specifically place a restriction on physical memory. However, it does mention that unauthorized changes invalidate your license: 

However, If you are using a Windows PC, you can download and use Firefox Portable as a workaround to access your bookmarks. 

The deepest AutoHotkey (AHK) can detect within Google Chrome, related to web content, is the control. This control is the viewport for web content. Our and HTML elements are a little deeper, inside the DOM of the rendered content. So, we need to find a way to communicate through this wall between the HTML elements and AutoHotkey. Luckily, there is a player on the same side as the HTML who can speak AHK's lingo: JavaScript! How so? To put it simply, JavaScript can perform an action when an element gains or loses focus. One of these actions can be changing the page title. This in turn changes Google Chrome's window title, and AHK can read window titles! 

Yes. You can shut down Windows 7 without installing updates by enabling the following Group Policy setting: 

Meiryo, the default Japanese font for Windows Vista/7, as well as some other Japanese fonts contain bitmap (pixel) characters at small sizes. Going back to your example, I was able to confirm this using Firefox: 

The simplest solution using AutoHotkey would be to map Ctrl+L to Alt+D when viewing a YouTube page on Firefox: 

Since YouTube could change their HTML naming scheme anytime, a more reliable solution would be to replace the first line with: 

This looks like a job for AutoHotkey! Rather than reinvent the wheel myself, user gwarble over at the AutoHotkey Forums has already created an application that does exactly what you want: 

This seems to be a driver issue. This can be remedied easily with any up-to-date Linux distribution. Boot from a Linux LiveCD, and then transfer your files to the USB external hard drive. 

Note: may or may not be required, depending on the version of Firefox. Using this address does not hide the Navigation toolbar. 

If you open up Settings > Style Configurator, you can inspect and customize a language's styles and syntax. Regarding Bash, or commands are highlighted as blue () by default. 

If you research the matter, you will find that groups have already made efforts to circumvent the memory restrictions in Windows 7. In summary, these methods require unsupported, unauthorized modification of systems files -- some specifically related to licensing -- in one way or another. My advice would be to go with Windows 7 Professional, since the Enterprise and Ultimate editions also have a 192 GB limit on RAM. 2 The only main features you would be missing would be BitLocker and extended language support. 3 

Is it faster to move files between media in large pieces (i.e. many files and folders within an archive) or move them file-by-file? Is there a significant difference, considering that the file transfer completes with no errors? 

You can compile an AutoHotkey script for each action and then assign the resulting EXE files to the buttons using the mouse driver software. For the Next media key, compile: 

You can try visiting Packard Bell's website in the past with the help of the Wayback Machine. For example, browsing inside the January 28, 1997 snapshot, I found this: 

Is there a way to invoke the Volume Control popup from the command prompt? Please note that I am not looking to use the Volume Mixer (): 

For what it's worth, this should work in any browser which supports the Alt+D shortcut to select the address. 

This is indeed possible with CSS using Stylish or userChrome.css. Apply the following to the element that has scroll bars: 

Firefox 13.0 introduced a Most Visited Pages function to the New Tab page. Now, instead of a blank page, you can choose to be presented with a grid layout of your most visited pages. 

Download and extract Process Explorer Log out and log back in to have the window appear (do not close it) Run Process Explorer Right click in the list of processes In the box, you should see the following: 

Windows 7 Home Premium EULANote: If the link expires, visit Microsoft | License Terms to download the EULA. Physical Memory Limits: Windows 7 Compare Windows 7: Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate

The AutoHotkey (AHK) scripting language is similar to BASIC, and as such is relatively easy to learn. If you are looking to get a general understand of how AHK works, the Tutortial is a great start. Anyway, the following should do what you want: 

Instructions: Hold down the Windows key and Click on the bookmark you want to update. You will see the Properties window flash as the URL is updated from the address bar. :) 

This will imitate pressing the Mute key, even if your keyboard does not have a dedicated key. I have compiled the script for you, so you may use it with your current software. 

Holding down Shift disables the AutoPlay function when you insert a disc or removable media. It does not apply to Windows' login/startup. If you are looking to disable or remove startup entries, you can use MSConfig or a utility such as Autoruns. 

Adobe Fireworks has a 'slicing' feature which can export an image into multiple images. As for the opensource realm, GIMP has a feature located under . These both use 'guides', vertical and horizontal lines which you have to place beforehand. 

So, the output that you receive on your Mac is what you get when you only send to . It tries to show you all matching results! All those entries are actually name servers (for DNS) that have been registered by domain name owners. For example, in your question, you can see listed. Here's what you get if you send to the .COM whois server: 

If the issue is with Adobe Flash Player (as opposed to YouTube's HTML 5 video player), disabling hardware acceleration should fix the problem. 

You can enable visual feedback when typing passwords by editing your file and changing the line to read: 

BMP is both uncompressed and lossless. PNG is compressed but lossless. Thus, with a lossless format the only visible difference is the file size. I'd recommend using PNG over BMP unless you can't for compatibility reasons. 

I could not find a better list, so after diggin through Firefox's various dialogs and windows, I present the following... Relevant as of Firefox 10. 

The Sync Key was been replaced with the Recovery Key. Clicking on and then will also give you the Recovery Key. 

Bonus Since the default browser background color is white, there may be a momentary flash when you open a new tab. To minimize this effect, you can set the preference in to . Restart Firefox for this change to take effect. 

Otherwise, you just have to be patient and wait for the developers to work on adding support for Windows 8. 

Update: I have successfully overcome the scancode issue with some clever logic! Using the following format, you should be able to switch any key with its Shift pair. Key repetition should also work. 

Initially, my solution was to assign a keyword to a bookmarklet and then use AutoHotkey to automate the following steps: pressing Ctrl+L to select the address bar, typing in the , and pressing Enter. This works great with normal bookmarks, as you will be taken to a new page. However, with bookmarklets that work with the current page, this is clumsy and moves the keyboard's focus. So, in an effort to avoid the address bar altogether, I've devised the following solution. Setup: 

The -no-remote option is used for running multiple Firefox profiles at the same time. You are getting the "Firefox is already running" message because you are trying to open a second Firefox instance with the same profile. You should be using this option as follows: 

The latter. You have 24 months to access the key on the DreamSpark website. This is just a convenience measure and it is assumed that you would have copied the key elsewhere by the time your access expires. 

So in the very least, you can find out who the IP address is registered to and reach out to that company for more information. If the IP address has a PTR record, then you can do also Whois lookup for that domain and reach out to the the owner for more info as well. 

Each method has it's own benefits. With embedding, all the content is contained within a single file. This simplifies distributing documents or moving them around, as all the content moves together. On the other hand, linking reduces redundancy, by having a single source for an object. A link's path can be relative or absolute. Since you are receiving a message about linked objects in your file, the Edit > Links command will highlight them for you. You can then remove the links and the objects will instead be embedded. 

Note: After making changes to (or creating) the file, you may have to eject the drive and reconnect it for changes to reflect. 

If you are using AutoHotkey (Basic), the code base hasn't been updated since September 2009. Obviously, any fundamental changes in Windows 8 have not been addressed. AutoHotkey_L is much more up-to-date, having last been updated this month. However, looking at the changelog, further Windows 8 support is minimal. If your script still doesn't work even after installing AutoHotkey_L, you could try the other Send commands: 

You need to decompress the outer archive, and then decompress the inner archive. You can use XZ Utils, as mentioned by @Journeyman, or 7-zip to extract the files. I recommend 7-zip, as it is more user-friendly. 

In my experience, this is caused by a problem with Hibernation or Hybrid Sleep. To help diagnose the problem, you can edit your power settings:
