first of all lets clear something 1. memory here means what?? a. it should mean interface buffer 2. which interface ? a. it can be your interface or any active device interface (switch for example) if you need to monitor broadcast ,there will be two ways .the first is to monitor your PC interface itself which may be not efficient cause you may suffer from any malware attack cause your interface to be congested . the second is to configure you active device (the switch ) to spin copy of traffic to the port where you are connected to then try to monitor via wireshark . any way if you decided to use any of them you must get this before. 

WISP Setup Provider (Wireless Internet Service Provider) are predominantly in rural environments where cable and digital subscriber lines are not available. WiMax is expected to become mainstream in the near future,the current called prewimax, bringing with it dramatic changes to the marketplace by increasing the number of inter operable equipment on the market and making mobile data transmission feasible, increasing the utility of such networks in rural environments. However, high-bandwidth wireless backhauls are already common in major cities, providing levels of bandwidth previously only available through expensive fiber optic connections. this linke is good reference for WISP 

for me it sounds like problem in CALL HUNTING configuration you have two ephone-dn 's (4 & 22) with 2000 extension ,which will handle the incommoding calls, where 4 with preference 0 and 22 with preference 1 which making the call going to 4 first ,but you configured 4 with huntstop channel which will Prevents incoming calls from hunting to the next channel if the first channel is busy or does not answer . so in case of line busy there is no place for the second call to go and it will go to call-forward busy 6000 , but you didn't configure any dial peer for forward busy . so you need to do two things 

so answer of your question (SW3's 0/4 is the Root Port because the Sending Port ID of 0/1 wins over 0/2)is YES please make use of this very usful linke STP 

you should be able to ping ISP and ROUTER B you need default route to access ISP resources in form of 

regarding the problem of those APs it was the AP output power , which need to be adjusted on the controller it self if you want to plot the shape of packet loss percentage you can use the great application ping plotter 

internet speed seams to be very good (80k/user X 50 user = 4000K = 4M) sure QOS is great thing to think about but first you need to make sure of the next. you must think about 1- Uplinks between switches and each other (specially when it seams you run spread network). lets say you attached the users to 3 24 port switchs for example and connect switches to each other by 1G uplink so you fail into bottle neck, so how you connect your switches to each other very affect the performance of any traffic switching. 2- uplink between switches and your router , port speed of each also can be bottle neck. 3- you must think about storm control and broad cast control , if you run over cisco switches may you adapt storm control and broad cast level. 4- Firewall traffic inspection may delay the voice traffic specially you run soft phones which may use the same range of IPs as normal Data . (you may configure your firewall with roles and polices which allow SIP traffic with no inspection based on port number or protocol type) 5- may you can make sure of your internet speed per each user to make sure it is equal or greater 80 KBPS. 

Download the license pack file that you received from Cisco <L-DCNM-L-N5K-K9=> into a directory on the server system. 

the answer of this question is depend of how we under stand data transmission across fiber optic ?? lets say we have a group of 0's and 1's represent the data need to be transferred from end to end . simply across the fiber optic ,transmitting such data is by turning laser light on for interval to represent 1 and turn it off for interval to represent 0 , this behave of sending data is DIGITAL the next figure show basic transmit and receive based on this concept 

other wise you will need to bay for monitoring tool include DPI features (i.e. solarwinds , manageenginee ) 

short answer is no way to know the local IP address (the private IP) of remote host . except you show the ARP address table or any sort of administrative show on L3 device connected to the remote site it self 

Sonicwall won't understand EIGRP cause EIGRP is Cisco proprietary may you try other routing protocol or tunnel the Sonicwall to forward the traffic without involving in any routing 

practically problem regard the high CPU usage still bending , but for the drop of the handheld traffic i found one useful work a round that to isolate the handhelds traffic in separate VLAN . 

if your router host small LAN switches modules.which is could be configured from the router itself and it is separate logical device with its own configuration.so 

last there are three things you must know (encapsulation ,decapsulation and layer to layer communication ) . each layer has a lot of protocols can create and understand ( ex. ARP request is layer 3 function use both layer 3 protocol IP and layer 2 protocol MAC-ADDRESS) 

Use inSSIDer to investigate your wireless network. The network that you are connected will be indicated by the green wireless icon. 

may you create loopback interfaces on the router with ips in these ranges to advertise it on the OSPF. 

apply or exit are needed to have the new vlan created then you need to configure the interface vlan and enable it, as next
