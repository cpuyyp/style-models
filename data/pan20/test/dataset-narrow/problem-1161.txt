NOTE (15.03.2016) In my question, I do not specified how large coefficients $c_e$ are allowed. Igor Sergeev remembered me that, for example, the following (univariate) polynomial $f(z)=\sum_{j=1}^m 2^{2^{jm}} z^j$ has $A(f)=\Omega(m^{1/2})$ (Strassen and people of his group). But $B(f)=0$ for this polynomial, since $f_b(z)=z$. We can obtain fron $f$ a multivariate polynomial $f'(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of $n=\log m$ variables using using Kronecker substitution. Associate with every exponent $j$ a monomial $X_j=\prod_{i:a_i=1}x_i$, where $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ are the 0-1 coefficients of the binary representation of $j$. Then the desired polynomial is $f'=\sum_{j=1}^m c_j X_j$, and we have that $$ A(f')+n\geq A(f)=\Omega(m^{1/2})=2^{\Omega(n)}. $$ But the boolean version of $f'$ is just an OR of variables, so $B(f')\leq n-1$, and we have an even exponential gap. Thus, if magnitude of coefficients can be triple-exponential in the number $n$ of variables then the gap $A(f)/B(f)$ can be shown to be even exponential. (Actually, not the magnitude itself -- more the algebraic dependence of the coefficients.) This is why the real problem with $A(f)$ is the case of small coefficients (ideally, only 0-1). But in this case, as Joshua recalled, the lower bound $A(f)=\Omega(n\log n)$ of Strassen and Baur (with 0-1 coefficients) remains the best what we have today. 

Second, protocols related to linear inequalities are indeed interesting in the context of cutting plane proofs. In this case, it is even enough to consider protocols, where the form of messages is very restricted: just values of some linear combinations of input variables can be communicated. 

Correction [6.03.2017]: Pascal Koiran (one of the authors of this paper) pointed to me that their model is more powerful than just arithmetic circuits: they allow Sign-gates (outputing $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the input is negative of not). So, the voting function Maj can be simulated in this model, and I take back my "confusion". 

ACTUALIZATION (added 03.11.2014): Emil Jeřábek has shown (via an amazingly simple construction, see his answer below) that the answer is "yes" as long as $t\leq n^c$ for a constant $c$. So, the question remains open only for super-polynomial (in $n$) thresholds. 

The best we know so far are matrices $A$ with $R_A(r)\geq (n^2/r)\log(n/r)$. For Sylvester matrices (i.e. inner product matrices), the lower bound of $\Omega(n^2/r)$ is easy to show. 

To be a bit more precise, let ${\cal C}$ be some class of circuit of size at most $t=t(n)$ computing functions $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$. Under a probabilistic circuit of size $t$ I'll mean just a probability distribution $\mathrm{Pr}:{\cal C}\to[0,1]$. Such a "circuit" computes a given function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}$ if $\mathrm{Pr}\{C\in{\cal C}\colon C(x)=f(x)\}\geq 2/3$ holds for every (single) input $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$. The VC dimension of ${\cal C}$ is the largest natural number $v$ (if there is one) for which there exist $v$ circuits $C_1,\ldots,C_v$ in ${\cal C}$ with the following property: 

Over the boolean semiring, the voting function $\mathrm{Maj}$ is the majority function, and has small (even monotone) circuits. So, Adleman's theorem follows by taking $X=\{0,1\}^n$. 

Under "new" I mean any really surprising consequences, like collapse/separation of other complexity classes. Compare this with consequences the proof/disproof of NP $\subseteq$ P/poly would deliver. 

For example, if ${\cal F}$ is the family of all $|{\cal F}|=2^n+1$ feasible solutions for the vertex packing (or maximum weight independent set) problem on the star $K_{1,n}$ with $n$ edges, then $r({\cal F})=1/n$, implying that greedy cannot achieve any better approximation factor than $1/n$ in the worst case. But the random $m$-weighting $\mathbf{x}$ will put the center of the star as the first only with probability $\leq 1/m$, meaning that $\alpha_p({\cal F})=1$ already for $p= 1-1/m$. Thus, even though greedy fails baldly in the worst case, it is optimal on all but a small proportion $1/m$ of all inputs $x$! The expected factor $\alpha[{\cal F}]$ is also near to $1$ for this family. 

Now, if $0=j_0\to j_1\to j_2\to\cdots\to j_k\to j_{k+1}=n+1$ is a simple $s$-$t$ path in $K_n$, then chose in each $H_{j_i}$ with $i\in\{0,1,\ldots,k\}$ the edge labeled by the edge $j_i\to j_{i+1}$, that is, by $x_{j_i,j_{i+1}}$. In all the remaining $H_j$'s chose the unlabeled edge. Then the obtained directed path in $G$ represents our path in $K_n$. Note however that $G$ does not satisfy condition (2): say the $s$-$t$ path in $G$ consisting of only unlabeled edges contains no $s$-$t$ path of $K_n$. Thus, $G$ cannot be turned into a DP algorithm. 

I will try to summarize my previous comments. Let us first ignore the fact that your original circuit has (constant) depth $k$; just assume it has size $S$. Let $A$ be the smallest number such that every unbounded fanin circuit size $S$ can be transformed into an unbounded fanin formula $F$ of size $O(S^A)$. I claim that the best we can do so far is to achieve $A=O(S/\log^2 S)$. Say, it is even not known whether whether any (fanin-2) circuit of size $S=O(n)$ can be simulated by a formula of size smaller than $\exp(n/\log n)$. To show the claim, we transform the formula $F$ into a fanin-2 formula $F′$ of size $M=O(S^{2A})$. It is well known that the depth $D$ of every formula $F′$ can be made logarithmic in its size, that is $D=O(\log M)=O(A\log S)$. [This was first shown by Khrapchenko 1968, and then the constant under big-O was improved to $D\leq 1.73\log_2M$ by several authors.] On the other hand, the best known result for fanin-2 circuits [Paterson and Valiant, TCS 2(3), 397-400] says that $Depth=O(Size/\log Size)$. Thus, having a simulation with $A$ much smaller than $S/\log^2 S$ would improve the best known Size-Depth simulation for circuits. This, however, is only a "word of caution" - it does not answer your question because you assume that your original circuit has constant depth $k$, implying that in this case we can just take $A=k$ (or $A=k−1$ if we have a single output gate). The power of Paterson-Valiant simulation is that it applies to arbitrary, even very unbalanced circuits whose depth is almost the entire size! But in your bounded-depth setting, even the case $k=3$ is not clear: can every depth-3 circuit of size $S$ be transformed into a depth-3 formula of size much smaller than $S^2$? I guess the answer should be "no" (could be an interesting exercise for students). A depth-3 formula is just a big OR of CNFs. The question is to find an OR of CNFs that share many clauses in common, but otherwise are "very different" to force a large depth-3 formula. The problem is that we want to obtain a formula (a fanout-1 circuit). As was pointed above, allowing gates of fanout-2 makes simulation simpler: Hoover, Klawe and Pippenger [JACM 31(1), 1980] show that any fanin-2 circuit of size $S$ and depth $D$ has an equivalent fanin-2 and fanout-2 circuit of size $3S−2n$ and depth $2D$. Thus, if fanin is unbounded, then the resulting circuit will have size $O(S^2)$ and depth $O(D\log S)$. There is yet another result somehow related to your question. Lozhkin (1981) proved that if a boolean function $f$ can be computed by an $AC^0$ formula of depth $k$ and size $S$, then $f$ can be computed by fanin-2 formula of depth $D\leq k-1+\lceil\log_2S\rceil$ (this follows from Theorem 6.2 in my book). Note that a trivial upper bound would only be $D\leq k\log S$ (if we would simulate each single gate by a tree of depth $\log S$).
