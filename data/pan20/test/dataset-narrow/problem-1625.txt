This isn't so much a question related to the Pi but is more of software based problem, so this question might be better suited on Stack Overflow. However, I'll give you a quick explanation here. Your problem is when the code is compiled the compiler gets to the line and it can't find the the function . The reason is you have defined the function after you try to call it. To fix this just move the function to the top of the program. A good practice in software development is to define all of your functions at the top of the program and your main code should be located under the functions. This prevents the issue you have encountered where the program can't find the function because it hasn't yet been defined. 

This will install the new GUI version of raspi-config, LibreOffice and its GTK extension, the Alacarte menu editor, the BlueJ and Greenfoot Java IDEs and the ClawsMail email client. The GUI will need cleaning up: 

Pi randomly freezing, probably due to insufficient power or an unstable power source. My recommendation is at a minimum to use a high quality phone or tablet charger that can reliably output 1.2A at 5V. However, I strongly recommend using an official Raspberry Pi power supply. In terms of measuring power consumption a multimeter is your best bet, although this website might interest you. As stated on the website run this set of instructions in the LXTerminal. 

I have been doing a lot of coding for the Raspberry Pi Camera in Python and have stumbled across a problem. To change the shutter speed of the camera in Python, it is possible to use this attribute: 

To launch the terminal using a keyboard you can create a keyboard shortcut such as Ctrl+Alt+t. To do this first run: 

Click the little folder button and go to the file location of the un-zipped Raspbian Disc Image file and select the file. You will also need an SD card connected to your computer and the location of that can be set under the Device drop down menu. Once you are happy that you have the Disc Image File and correct drive letter for the SD card selected you can press the write button. It will take a few minutes for Raspbian to be written to the SD card. Once a message pops up saying the write was successful you can safely remove the SD card from your computer. The SD card is now ready to be used in a Raspberry Pi. 

Again exit the file with saving. The isn't necessary, it just means the Pi will connect to one network in preference over the other. In theory the Pi should be visible on both networks, but it's not something I've tried yet but I am meaning to get round to it. 

The section of code before the is the voice command, the section of code after the is the action the Pi will perform upon hearing the voice command. In the example above saying check internet will cause the Pi to ping google.com. This is the bit where you can get really creative and setup different commands for various voice commands. Edit 1: Running or might give an empty file. In which case edit the file so it contains the following: 

In select and press the ENTER key select Audio and press ENTER. By default I think the option is Auto but you should try changing the option so it forces audio through HDMI then press ENTER to enable that mode. Exit by pressing the right arrow followed by selecting . If that still does not work you will need to edit the config.txt file: 

As far as I am aware the Pi 3's CPU is currently not overclockable, its maximum clock speed is set at 1.2GHz. But what about overclocking the GPU? Is it even possible? And would I see performance gains in applications like playing games? 

This WebIOPi+ is based off the original WebIOPi version however it has been designed to work with the Pi Zero. For more information here is the official GitHub page. 

I've tried using a small fan to cool my Pi 3, the fan itself is only about four times the bigger than the main Broadcom chip. I have found that alone, at best has knocked 10°C off the CPU temperature. If your interested in that, you can buy the case and fan here. The fan plugs into the GPIO, so its powered by the Pi. Therefore, be sure to use a decent power supply because the CPU under load and a fan connected is going to require a lot of current to run. As well as temperature you need to think about exposure to UV, electronics and UV are not the greatest combination. So the Pi is going to need to be protected by a UV proof enclosure along with the camera. The main Broadcom chip is not the only consideration with regards to cooling, I have heard the Ethernet/USB controller can get hot under load. As well as the power delivery circuitry on the Pi. You can get a heatsink set that will cover anything that as the potential to get really hot, for example this set. Whatever enclosure the Pi is you need to think about airflow, heatsinks will not work effectively unless there is a current of air passing over them. Also given you are leaving the Pi outside you might want to consider some weather proofing. Be aware that the Pi is designed to run without active cooling, it will only start to thermal throttle at 85°C. However given the Pi could be under a lot of load with the whole camera set-up, I do recommend cooling. 

To be honest with you I think you've exhausted the list of browsers I'm aware of. Out of the four I think Chromium might the one I have had the most luck with. I would certainly be interested to know what the "bug" is. The issue is maybe not so much the browsers but the device they are running on. The Pi 3 is by no means an underpowered device but loading webpages can be really resource intensive. I'm not sure what you are defining as content heavy but even on a fairly simple site there is multiple things that might need to be loaded. JavaScript is probably the main culprit with regards to slowdowns on webpages loading. Installing some kind of adblocker, (depending on if you deem it ethical or not), would reduce the amount of information that needs to be loaded. You can go one step further in Iceweasel/Firefox and install an extension called NoScript from $URL$ This will block any JavaScript from running and should lead to a speedier web browsing experience. Also worth keeping in mind is multitasking, having multiple tabs open at once can have a dramatic impact on overall performance. Try to avoid doing multiple things at once or in really quick succession. I wouldn't recommend having more than 5 tabs open at once in any of the web browsers. As you have discovered that requires lots of RAM. In general don't expect the same web browsing experience on a Pi as you would a full desktop computer or even a smartphone. The Pi 3 is leaps and bounds ahead of the original model, but don't expect it to perform like a more powerful device does. 

The number of times the green LED flashes indicates what the problem is: For Pi's running firmware before 20th October 2012: 

When booting the Pi you need to hold down the SHIFT key. This boots the Pi into recovery mode and you will be able to access the config.txt file as shown in the picture below. There's a different config.txt file for each OS, so you need to select the OS you are using. 

A segmentation fault could imply the filesystem is corrupt. If the error is only occurring when you are trying to install packages try running: 

When I read the spec sheet for the Raspberry Pi 3, I was both excited and slightly disappointed. Excited because the Raspberry Pi Foundation continues to release Raspberry Pis with ever increasing CPU performance, so it is actually usable as a computer now. Also they have continued to add features, for example the on board Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But disappointed because there is still no USB 3.0. And this leads me onto my point. There is a limit to how much further they can go with the current architecture of the Broadcom chip they use on the Pi. So surely this means there will be a point were to add more features (USB 3.0), they will have to use a newer architecture? And if this point is reached, would projects made on older generation Raspberry Pis be supported? 

Which installs ownCloud, it will also ask you to set up a password. The above command also installs some Apache webserver stuff that is also required. To install the extra Apache modules run: 

I assume you want to delete the partitions and start again with the SD card? If you have a Windows computer there is a program called MiniTool Partition Wizard, you can download it here. Plug the SD card into your computer, then open up MiniTool Partition Wizard, you should see your SD card listed with all the partitions on it. Using MiniTool Partition Wizard you can easily adjust the size of different partitions, create new partitions, or delete partitions. If you want to set the SD card back to its defaults, in MiniTool Partition Wizard, delete all the partitions on the SD card. Next, create a new primary partition which is the full size of the SD card. Once you have done this close MiniTool Partition Wizard and using file explorer format the SD card to device defaults. 

Yes it is possible to use a standard USB webcam with the Pi. For example if you are running Raspbian: First install : 

You can clearly see the two LEDs labelled YELLOW and GREEN are hardwired to the connector pins. A hardware hack that might work although if your not confident with electronics do not try this. Is to de-solder the ACT LED and run a wire from each pad on the PCB from where the LED is connected and the solder the LED across the end of the two wires. I dubious as to whether that would work because the wires might introduce too much resistance. There is a way of connecting an LED to the GPIO and it giving the same functionality as the ACT LED, you might find this thread useful. I think going the GPIO route is probably your best solution. You can thread wires from the GPIO through the case to an LED. 

This will take a jpeg picture and save it with the filename image. Use the tag to specify the resolution of the image: 

A quick way to do this is to connect a USB microphone to your Pi, open a terminal window and run the following command: 

I've done a quick search through some forums related to this router and the issue is not unique to the Pi. Apparently the same behavior is observed with Apple devices as well. The best thing I can suggest is restarting the router and seeing if it makes any difference. The problem lies somewhere in the software which detects whether a device is connected. Clearly the rest of the functionality of the router works as the Pi has a network connection. I know the Pi not showing up under connected devices might be annoying if you do have to resolve a network issue with it in the future, but as everything else is working I wouldn't worry about it too much. For further reading you might be interested in this thread, and also this one. From what I've read there this is a big problem with the router. If you want a fix calling out your ISP is one option. Although, to be honest with you ISP provided equipment is normally notoriously low quality so you could use this as an excuse to invest in some nicer networking equipment. 

Will there be a new version of OpenELEC for the Raspberry Pi 3? Or would the install file for the Raspberry Pi 2 work? 

Interestingly on the Hardware History Wiki Page it notes that the 1.2 board features the BCM2837, which is the Broadcom chip used in the Pi 3. The underlying architecture between BCM2837 and BCM2836 as used in earlier revisions of the Pi 2 is the same. The key difference is the ARMv7 quad core cluster was replaced with a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ARMv8) cluster. There does not seem to have been any revisions to the Pi 3 Model B. If some unexpected fault is discovered, I assume a new revision would be created. I'm not sure that any significant hardware changes are going to be made to it. Also a "Pi 4" is to not going be released in 2017 according to Eben Upton the Pi's co-creator. And also on the topic of the rapid realease of the Pi 3 after the Pi 2 he said.
