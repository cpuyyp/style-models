As Electrawn mentions, the libmcrypt package is now in the Webtatic repo, it was depending on the EPEL repository, but not everyone has this installed. As for the php54w-mysql installing MySQL 5.5 issue, this was resolved 6th May: $URL$ 

Yum does a check on /etc/yum.repos.d/webtatic.repo to see if it has changed, but this appears to not be happening when this file is installed by the second rpm -Uvh command, and yum clean all does not stop this Webtatic EL6: 

You should then only see the packages you've set to be removed and installed in the list, and you can confirm the installation to switch over. Any services currently running with php loaded will need to be restarted, for instance httpd or php-fpm. As for this being 'seamless', any software changes happening while users are able to access the website should have the consequences fully understood. Shared libraries being removed and added when a process hasn't already loaded them could potentially load while the shared library isn't there. It's better to do software upgrades like this offline, and preferably tested on a non-production machine first to verify the process works as expected. 3 . To switch to a hypothetical CentOS base php54 package (CentOS 5 used php53 prefix), you just run the above steps replacing php removal with php54w removal, and php54w installation with php54 installation e.g. 

This should be put above any conflicting RewriteCond/Rule's, so they wont interfere with the redirection. Any .htaccess files in subdirectories will by default remove this rule and not do the redirect. To fix them, you must add either the rule again to them, or set them to inherit from parent .htaccess files, e.g.: 

You could configure Squid on the server to allow the proxying of Yum from the private subnet to the Redhat update servers. It can also cache packages, meaning it will only download a package once for all updates. $URL$ 

Webtatic has added yum-plugin-replace to it's repository, and the guide is updated to allow upgrading via this method: $URL$ Assuming CentOS 5.x: 

proxy_redirect will only rewrite redirect headers, not the HTML content needed for this to work. There is no easy way to rewrite the HTML content in Nginx. There is the HttpSubModule, which you can manually add text substitutions, but is lengthly to set up each substitution: $URL$ It is easliest if possible to just update the content at $URL$ to have the redirected path in instead. 

This will allow www-data into the folder for reading, but only give the git user write access. Any other user can't do anything. If you want to add additional writers, I would add another group git-writers and add the users and git to it as well as the git-readers group, then use the following structure: 

mod_auth_mysql's crypt algorithm uses a different format of hash to Bugzilla's e.g. a crypt SHA-256 password would look like this: 

CentOS 6.4 broke backwards compatibility in some library versions, and so latest Webtatic builds only support CentOS 6.4 for some packages (most of the PHP packages are unaffected). If you can update your CentOS 6.x version to 6.4, that would solve the issue. CentOS has in recent years started making it hard to fix to earlier releases to try to push users to the latest release. It's not an ideal situation for servers that can't be upgraded, but repositories would have to support each minor release to avoid this situation. 

However as for the switch to the hypothetical base php54, there will likely be no alternatives for some packages (e.g. there was no php53-pecl-memcache extension in CentOS 5) and Webtatic has packages that aren't available in CentOS base (e.g. php54w-pecl-zendopcache). If they are missing, then you usually don't have any other option than to use pecl directly to install them. 4 . Any PHP upgrade may introduce bugs, and websites should be retested. This is not specific to Webtatic, but the general idea that new features introduce new bugs. Unlike Remi's repository in the accepted answer, the Webtatic EL6 repository never uses the same package names as CentOS base repositories, so will not override installation/upgrade of packages you don't intend to switch to, and as such is enabled by default.

If you are able to get more than one IP address added to the virtualhost, then you can use two SSL virtualhosts, with each using one of two SSL certificates. The virtualhosts would each need to identify which IP address they should be using e.g. in Apache Httpd: 

I used a turnkeylinux.org otrs installation and I'm trying to configure the default domain of 'yourhost.example.com'. I tried the following: 

A lot of script simplification would be had if they are. EDIT: I should add these "processes" aren't daemons and don't actually record their PID in the FS anywhere ... 

I tested fairly extensively with Ubuntu 10.04 Beta 2 Server in a VM, and was able to simply copy (read ) a cross compiled tool chain from an Ubuntu 8.10 VM. I created the tar myself, which is essentially a lot of stuff in . Now that I've got a bare metal installation of Ubuntu 10.04 proper, the copy isn't working. In particularly, I'm getting the error: 

I've configured my router to accept a public key SSH session with a passphrase. They key pair was generated using the PuTTY tools on windows. I can open the session from both Windows and Linux using the Putty tools, but I can't do so with on Linux. When prompted by for the keyfile's passphrase, it fails. Ex: 

I was installing Server2003 Std and Server2008 Std on hardware recently. When joining the servers to the domain during the install, I was asked for credentials. I answered with the the DC's Admin user and password. What minimum level of credentials are normally required to join a member server to a domain? 

I have a cgi script that is resending an email on a failed attempt 5-10 minutes after a user accesses a page. My thought was to do this using the command from a python call (). Testing revealed: 

I'm looking at some scripts, and a number of them use this what is essentially this command in their "" target: 

I've got VMWare ESXi (the free version) machine that is booting off a 9650SE RAID-1 drive setup (two 1TB mirrored drives). I'd like to replace the 1TBs with 2TBs. Is there a safe way to do this? 

I've configured to automagically mount a cifs share when users login; the problem is if a user logs into multiple times simultaneously, the mount command is repeated multiple times. This so far isn't a problem but it's messy when you look at the output of a command. 

I have a server that I use infrequently, so I'd like to a job to shutdown daily if no users are logged in via SSH and SAMBA shares. How can I determine how many active SSH connections there are, and how many active SAMBA connections there are? If both of these values are zero, the cron script will shutdown the server. 

With the value set to true, the module was trying to remove from the system, not, as I assumed, in the directory. 

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and have the directory setup as a BTRFS RAID 1 with two 2TB drives. I'd like to make the directory just a single drive; how do I safely go about doing this? 

The next time I logged and tried to create a user, the default domain was still there. How can I change default doamin in an OTRS installation? 

I'm putting together an file server which will have a very limited number of users (less than 5) and offer the following services: 

First, let me state, this was an IT goof up. They deleted an account, went "oops" and created a new account with the same credentials. I can't fathom why. Regardless, I've got a Linux (Ubuntu Server 10.04) box authenticating against an active directory server, and users logging in have local home directories and such. I'm stuck with one user name having a new UID (or SID in AD jargon). Over and above ing his home directory, what other interventions should I do? 

My active directory password changed, now I can't log into Redmine (0.9.4) via LDAP. I haven't installed plugins, so what gives? 

Data reliability is the most important issue; power comes next, and I could care less about speed. For the data hardware I've chosen a 3WARE 9650SE-4LPML which will be hosting two (2) TLES enabled WD RE4-GP drives running RAID-1. The decision I'm facing now is what file system should I use? My preference is for something Linux based, and a file system that attempts not only file system integrity but data inegrity as well. Please comment on which file systems, OS distributions and for that matter hardware chosen that you think may best fit my requirements. 

I'm assuming I need to fiddle with either the file or to accomplish this. How can I instruct to avoid duplicate mountings?
