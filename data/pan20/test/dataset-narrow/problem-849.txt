Buffer pool is for caching retrieved table and index data in memory, query cache just caches the parsed mysql queries. The former is much larger and usually far more important. Sure you can use both. 

Editions have to do with licenses only and the licenses can be applied and changed late without reinstall, if you initially only installed the free license. 

Virtualbox and vmplayer will do also. Xen is another. For guest os you might want to start either with jeos or one of the minimal ubuntu isos. You can easily find all these. 

Use the command runlevel to find what is the run level, which is the number before on or off. So if your run level is 2, you can grep 2:on from the above output and find all the services that are on. Usually run level is set in /etc/inittab, but can be changed. 

In general you should be safe unless the client shows an a warning or error. I have used the same client to different serversvwith no issues. This mysql article also says that the client and the server do not have to match versions, despite the fact that when the difference sometimes could cause problems. $URL$ Related issue: you can generally replicate from a server to a higher version of server as well, but the features are limited by the older version. Client should have even fewer problems because commands are interpreted and executed by the server. 

There should be no expected issues just from running this command (otherwise the man page will be full of dire warnings for sure). If things die, then it would not be due to atime update turned off, but some hardware problems you have. that remount simply turns off the atime updates and will thus have LESS disk usage and therefore make things less likely to die. Have done this sort of things many times and never see any issue. If you are still concerned and if you can later restart the system or mysql, you certainly can do so. 

Port 25 is the standard port SMTP traffic runs on. If you intend for you system to be an email server than those might be legit servers trying to send you or your users email. If you do not intend your system to be an email server, figure out how to get port 25 turned off. Historically email servers would be configured to politely send on email for other servers. Today this is bad, bad, bad. It's called being an open email relay. It would be wise for you to verify that you are not doing this. But, don't go to far and try to block port 25 traffic if you do mean to accept email from the outside world. 

About serving static files. Yes, you can use a lighter web server to do this. But, before you go to the effort be sure that it will do you any good. Is apache really using resources you need elsewhere? Maybe just configure apache to not start quite so many child processes. Be sure the added complication will pay for itself, because down the road it will almost assuredly confuse somebody when they try to figure out how everything is working. 

The reason your seeing php as having been built without sqlite is so fedora can split the php package and thus not force a big string of dependencies on people who don't want them. For instance you need sqlite and thus likely you do not need postgresql. If fedora was to build the main mod_php application with all --with's turned on you would end up installing postgresql without needing or wanting it. This helps people concerned with both security (only install exactly the software needed) and people concerned with package download bandwidth. 

I'm assuming, possibly incorrectly that your users are sitting in from of the windows boxes and need access to some linux gui applications. VNC works very nicely. Most Linux distributions have a the server sides vnc x-server included these days. Get a compatible windows vnc client and you should be good. If you need some additional security look for the ssl-enabled vnc stacks that are starting to crop up. Getting a windows side xserver like the one in cygwin will also works but is more complicated and will be much harder to explain to windows users. If your users are already linux savy this won't be to bad, otherwise go with vnc. 

Looks fine but in linux probably there is always some way to get around it, because once you have an account, escalating your priv. is far easier than breaking in, if you do not trust your users. If you are really concerned, I would suggest some sort of restricted or limited shell. These are not hacking-proof either but tend to help with most cases. You can make it a little harder for the user to chattr +i file to make it immutable. 

Are you concerned about the OS, the data, or both? If the only thing you change is data and data is in a separate data disk, say mounted on /home, then it would be the easiest. If the vmdk file is fairly small say only a few GB, you can just overwrite the older one with the new. For data, you can just power them up in the same subnet, and do an rsync with the update option. The upshot is it would depend on your detailed requirements. Actually I would also recommend simply put the vm in a usb stick and play it wherever you go. 

I did a google search (I know that does not provide the answer per se) on the linux kernel mailing list site, but the entries found seem to indicate that it is more or less something harmless. not sure if any entry actually applies to your case, but you can take a quick look at the search result of: local_softirq_pending site:lkml.org 

You can configure that either in the esxi console, or more likely using the vsphere client. Host -> Configuration -> Network, depending on whether it is for your host or for your vm network, or just add it to the network teaming. 

there is no known way of querying the config of a running sshd instance, i think, if you are referring the openssh server. depending on what you want to do, you could use the -t flag to test a configuration file to make sure that it is valid before restarting the server, so that you don't get kicked out, esp. if you do not have any out-of-band access to the server. 

I'd suggest using the expensive raid controller to do the bulk of the raid work. LSI cards and the software they come with works quite nicely. When properly configured, they will send you email when intereting things happen to the array. Like when disks fail. There is nothing wrong with either of the two linux software raid options, but you've gone out and purchased a somewhat fancy raid card. Let it do the work. Configure the disk array to expose one big device to Linux. If you would like to break up the final device into small volumes use lvm for that. One big physical volume, one big volume group and cut the volume group into whatever number of logical volumes you need. 

You should try the Django work without any restarting of apache. Most sever side environments work fine while doing development work without any need for stopping and starting the web server over and over again. But, yes you can run any number of apace instances as long as you make sure your second server's config file is pointing at different resources. Like: 

Be sure to try generating lots of different types of failed login attempts. Try from X (gdm or kdm or xdm), try from the console, try from ssh, try from sudo and try from su. Different subsystems can (and will) be configured different ways. It's not uncommon for ssh to be configured to use an internal login command that cuts around the /var/log/btmp business. Try the command as well. You might look in /var/log/secure to see if your failed login attempts are being stored there. But, I'm afraid I don't know the structure of the Debian log directory. Try on anything in the /var/log directory. It's quite likely that ssh is logging something someplace. 

Nothing requires that ping be possible between two hosts. It might be that somebody between you and google is dropping ICMP packets. If everything else is working I'd not worry much about this. If you are particularly worried check with whoever runs your networking equipment or firewall and see if they are letting ICMP traffic through. Also check to see if you can ping anybody else in the outside world other than google? 

You can calculate a hash (say md5sum) of the file, and then send that along for the recipient server to verify. This is a standard way of verifying the file integrity, if you are concerned. 

Your question 2 is actually the correct answer, but doublecheck that you have: hosts: files dns in your /etc/nsswitch.conf just to be sure. generally external dns should be in your dns record, but in server1, files (which means /etc/hosts in this case) will take precedence and thus used to resolve the host to the internal ip, while the rest of internet will resolve the same hostname to the external ip. the usual practice though is to use an internal domain altogether if you have to use dns name (mydomain.local for example). 

the second line should have been X.X.X.X www.abc.com www domains are hierarchical, so you can have sub1.abc.com, www.sub1.abc.com, or even www.sub2.sub1.abc.com, etc. 

It is because you must have used ssh somemachine and ssh somemachine.search.domain in the past, which creates 2 different entries. In ubuntu this is how my entries were created, in any case. 

It certainly could, but automatic reboot is usually associated with hardware/software issues such as overheating or kernel bugs. So it is possible that heavy load causes overheat which leads to reboot. In any event, you should investigate the log or kernel dumps to find the exact cause. 

I don't think that will upgrade all your nginx, and if you do a dpkg -l | grep nginx you will probably see that your nginx-full is still 1.1.19 do this (after backing up data if any!) 

You can study livecd layout of your distro, but likely you need /var instead of /var/log and in some distros there are files in /etc that must be writable. /home as well unless you put home dir elsewhere. 

yes, godaddy can handle your domain email accounts already so you don't have to install your own mail server. it is probably the simplest way to go. $URL$ however, i have not been actively managing any godaddy domain for a couple of years so you need to read their latest documents and email their support if you have more questions.
