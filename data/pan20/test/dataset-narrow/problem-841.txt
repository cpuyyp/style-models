I'd like to deploy Office 2010 on Citrix servers, but i can't enable form scripting support. With outlook 2007, it was solved by adding Outlvbs.dll in the office directory, and running But it seems this does not work anymore with Outlook 2010, I get the following error : I don't get much help from microsoft support site, as there isn't a lot of informations on office 2010 yet. Have anyone succeded in installing and using outlook 2010 with form scripting in a citrix environment ? 

You can try to change the wireless connexion metric, to an higher metric than your wired connection. This way, your wireless connection default route will always be used if you're connected to the wireless network. 

I may be mistaken, but you can try to add a -i parameter, so that the process you're trying to launch will run in an interactive mode in the specified target computer. Edit : I just saw what you're trying to acheive, and I don't think you can acheive that with psexec, which is used to execute process on remote computers. Here, you may what to try an application presentation solution, like Xenapp or Windows 2008 remote desktop services 

I'm looking for a way to prevent people to send emails to anyone but a whitelist of trusted contacts / trusted domains. Currently we're using an outlook macro to achieve that, but i'm wondering if there's a way to do this within Exchange ? WE're urrently using Exchange 2003, but are planning on upgrading to exchange 2010. Maybe this feature already exists in Exchange 2010 ? 

I've got an SQL database on an azure VM (non domain) that i'd like to backup to our internal DPM 2012 server. I've installed the DPM agent on the Azure VM, setup DCOM to use only the ports 5000 to 5025 on both the VM and the DPM server, created the 135, 5000-5025, 5718 5719 endpoints on azure and on the VM's firewall. When trying to add this agent to the DPM server, I end up with an error, "Unable to contact the protection Agent on server .cloudapp.net" I know there is some sort of connection between them, as using a wrong password gives me an Invalid Credentials error. The error seems to be DCOM related : When trying to connect to the Azure VM from the DPM server using VBEMTest, i get an Error "0x800706ba The RPC server is unavailable", but access is deneid when using wrong credentials ) What am i missing ? Has someone been able to achieve this kind of setup ? Thanks for your help ! 

You can try to set the proxy of IE to a fake proxy, and add the website you want your users to access in the exception list of that proxy ? that way, no data connection at all, except for the website you choose. Cost : zero ! 

I read recently some news about how MS will have to hand over data to the US government if they asked for it. ( $URL$ or $URL$ ) Some of our clients could be concerned by that. MS does have european datacenters, but i was wondering if anyone knew if these datacenter could be targeted too ? 

You can have most of this using the PFsense firewall distribution. It allows you to easily setup a captive portal, manage a proxy for the users, block them with firewall rules. All is configurable through an easy to use web interface, and if you want more advanced features, you can always go deeper with command line. And all the hardware you'll need is a cheap computer with a wireless network card :D 

I am not a systems person, please forgive my lack of knowledge. I have set up FreeIPA 4.5 on Centos 7. I was able to successfully manage user login to a test server (Fedora 27). So, FreeIPA is "working" (in that capacity anyway). I am trying to use FreeIPA to manage access rights for a Samba server (again, Fedora 27), in a test environment for now. I am following instructions on the FreeIPA site. So far I have added the service to the ipa server via (with my working domain). However, I had to use --force because DNS failed (I know this is possibly related, I could not get past this issue either). When I try to on the Samba server, I get Can anyone give me some guidance? Please let me know of any other info I can provide. 

I have a vm running a LAMP stack with Fedora 22. This is a server dedicated to running OwnCloud. The server and OwnCLoud ran fine for several weeks. I had to reboot the server. On reboot mysqld fails to start. Attempting to manually start the service fails also. 

After spending more time than I should have, I removed and reinstalled Postfix. This action resolved the problem. I guess I had a bad initial install. My steps: 

I am interactively editing my hosts file with a bash script. I need to insert a line in my hosts file. The line needs to be inserted on the first blank line after a specific comment. The content I am inserting is in a variable. Here is what I tried ($NEWLINE is set previously): 

Our network is a small peer-to-peer / workgroup, no domain controller, no AD. We just added a new file server running Fedora 27. This server has several shares on it. All shares are accessible from all workstations (Mostly windows 7), except one (also Windows 7). This same problem workstation can access the other Samba servers and shares. The new server is visible in 'Network' on the problem workstation. I know I have not given enough info. But, I don't know enough to know what to share. Can anyone give me some direction as to where to look for the problem? Let me know what other info I can provide. 

I am trying to set up key-based ssh access to a Fedora 25 box. I have done this on many Ubuntu servers with no issues. I get Here is my set up process: 

I am working with an inherited Fedora server that has dozens (maybe hundreds) of Perl scripts. Many of these mount then unmount network locations. So, the mounts are not discoverable with the mount command. We are about to move some network storage to other servers. Is there a way to pull from logs everything that has been mounted / unmounted in the past 30 days? Is mount activity typically logged? EDIT I was unclear in my original question. Updating to help the future. The shares are all via Samba; added that to the question. 

I found the problem. The hard drive was running out of space. I suppose there was not enough space for MySQL to write to the log, causing it to fail. Since this is a vm, I added virtual drive space. Posting this in hopes that it helps someone else, and that my hours of time are of some benefit to someone. 

I'd recommend that you check appdeploy.com for informations on how to silently deploy your software. Most of the time you'll find here informations on how to extract an MSI from a .exe installer if it is supported by the installer. For instance, with the msn example : $URL$ 

The greyed out Edit button may be caused by rights issue, make sure that you have the correct permissions to edit the GPO. To see the users who'll be affected by this GPO, check the "security filetering" groups. the users in that group should be affected by your GPO (provided the're in the correct linked OU) 

We can't really do our job correctly without scripting, and sometime these scripts can be difficult to create / debug with only text editors I'm currently using UltraEdit or Notepad++ as text editors and scripting platform (syntax highlighting is almost mandatory), but I was wondering if there was a more advanced scripting environment, an IDE of some sort, for VBscript and Powershell mostly ? (like always, free is better, but if the tool is really good I'm not against paying for it) 

To avoid the google redirection, just use $URL$ , it will direct you to the google.com website even if you're located in another country. 

You can either use the DISM utility from the WAIK to inject drivers to the WIM file, or there's a gui to do that (check $URL$ ) 

If you want to troubleshoot this kind of issue, you can try to setup the userenv.log file with high details, try to login, wait a bit and then review the userenv.log file. You should be able to see what is stopping your login. More information here : $URL$ 

You sometimes may have to host your own mail systems because you need to be able to know exactly where you data is, geographically speaking. It happens a lot in the banking world. 

Someone told me one day : "Dress for the job level you're trying to reach", and it must be one of the best advice I've ever heard in my professional life. 

In the "Citrix connection configuration tool", you can prevent the client printers to be mounted by editing the ica connection --> clients settings --> uncheck "Connect client printers at logon". There's the same configuration option in the rdp connection, you can configure it from the same tool. The connection configuration tool can be accessed from the citrix server, in the administration tool menu, or by using the ICA toolbar. 

In my case, we install updates at 4am, in order to avoid impact on any users, even those working a bit late. If you have a good monitoring system that warns you if a problem occurs, you should be able to fix it early in the morning, before even going to work. 

I think that Forefront client security (server equivalent of MS security essentials) should be the easiest thing to implement on server OS $URL$ 

There's a GPO setting to automatically logoff "disconnected" sessions after a period of time, that way people can leave their sessions idle but still connected without the fear of being disconnected, and people just closing their RDP client will be correctly disconnected. 

I'll have to deploy virtual machines on demo laptops, which will use Vmware player, but I've got some security concerns, as some data stored in the virtual machines are a bit sensitive. Is there a way to prevent the copy of these virtual machines ? Are the virtual hard drives encrypted, and if not is there a way to encrypt them ? In short, is there a way to lock down everything so that nobody could copy and or use these VMs in another computer ? EDIT : Truecrypt to encrypt the VM could be a solution, but if the password used by truecrypt is leaked, then it becomes useless. Associating the VM with a computer so that it can only run on a specifica hardware should do the trick, but I haven't found a solution that allows me to do that... 

I am not an experienced Linux administrator (getting that out there first). We plan on using FreeIPA to manage users and systems internal to our network (mixed Linux and Windows, no Windows DC, set up under workgroup - no domain). By following a tutorial, I have FreeIPA 4.5 set up under CentOS 7. The system currently works as expected for user management for login to a test server (Fedora 27). My next step is to get IPA to manage Samba shares. I am attempting to get this to work on the test server. The FQDN of the IPA server is net.mycompany.com, where "mycompany.com" is publicly registered, the "net" subdomain is not. The IPA server host file has the entry: [server IP] net.mycompany.com net I am following a tutorial on setting up FreeIPA to manage Samba. The step returns returns How do I add/configure DNS on an existing FreeIPA server in an internal-only network? I found instructions for installing FreeIPA with DNS. However, I do not wnat reinstall, unless I must. Is setting up DNS within FreeIPA what I need to do to resolve my issue? 

We had to add a record for the domain to our router, which acts as a DNS server for our LAN. So, locally the domain resolves to the IP of the FreeIPA server. After the above DNS correction I was able to successfully add the Kerberos key to the Samba server. 

I am trying to install Postfix on an Ubuntu 16.04 server; this is a web server. I need Postfix for send-only for fail2ban and logwatch. All Postfix tutorials show that apt install postfix ends with dialog windows. When I run sudo apt install mailutils all I get is a completed script, no install (that I can tell). How do I configure my install? (there is no /etc/postfix/main.cnf) Sorry for the lack of support info. I do not know enough to know what to give you. Ask, and I will post what I can. 

I am trying to redirect all requests within a directory on a server to https. I have tried the following in a separate config (within the config.d directory), and in an .htaccess file. Neither work, but cause no errors. 

When I tried in a config file the above was within a block. EDIT Here is my code in the config file: 

(server) create /home/[user]/.ssh (local) copy key.pub to remote /home/[user]/.ssh/authorized_keys (server) chmod 700 /home/[user]/.ssh (server) chmod 600 /home/[user]/.ssh/authorized_keys (server) chown -R [user]:[user] /home/[user]/.ssh/ 

I found the solution. The problem does seem to have been in the naming of directories. Instead of using the slash delimiter for the space, I had to wrap the directory names in quotes. (I didn't know Linux saw any difference in the 2 methods) In the commands where I was using directory names, this did not work: 

Given the above, will use the settings that are in fstab, or do I need to specify them in my script? 

I have a backup system that uses mounts that are put in place in fstab. I had a failure today because the mount was not there. I want to have my script check for the mount, then mount if it is not present. i.e. 

I am a software developer trying to help with a network issue (letting you know I don't know what I am doing). We are a very small shop. We have a Samba network with a dozen or so Linux servers, and maybe 2 dozen users. Network discovery stopped working last week. Users cannot browse to network resources. Most users are Windows 7, I have an Ubuntu box and a Fedora box with the same issue. I can connect by manually entering resource locations (by name). Windows users can as well, but have to manually connect by IP address. There have been no intentional changes to the network. We did have a power interruption last week. We have rebooted the router, and the switches. Can anyone give me some guidance? Thanks for any help you can offer. EDIT: We still have this issue. We have one Mac user - Network Discovery works for him.
