That is what firewalls do. You can use a firewall to isolate parts of your network. This is common in large business networks where labs or other network segments must be isolated from the rest of the network. You install the firewall so that the isolated network is on an outside firewall interface. You could use ACLs in a router or layer-3 switch to block any traffic to or from the network, too. The difference being that the firewall is stateful, but ACLs are stateless (static). A firewall could be configured to allow fine-grained access from your network to the isolated network. Your drawing where you have a host (MAC connected to both networks actually defeats any security that you are trying to implement. If you are concerned that the 15 PCs could try to compromise your network, the MAC defeats that if it is compromised. 

Typically, your Wi-Fi frame payload will be encrypted, and we cannot/will not help you decode the encryption. The MAC addresses will be in the unencrypted frame headers. The first six octets of the frame headers should be the destination address, and the next six octets should be the source MAC address. There is software that will help you see this better, but recommendations are off-topic here. Wireshark needs its data in a specific format (PCAP). 

This question is confusing. Even with IGPs, you need to tell the routing protocol what to advertise. For example, you use network statements to tell OSPF which interfaces participate in OSPF (and possibly redistribution to advertise networks), which doesn't automatically advertise every interface address (e.g. loopbacks) or network in the router. With BGP, you use network statements to tell BGP which prefixes (that already exist in the routing table, including directly connected networks) to advertise. A loopback network will exist in the routing table, so you can use a network statement to advertise it, or you can redistribute connected networks, just like you can do with OSPF. BGP will not simply try to connect to a peer on an interface, the way some IGPs do when they are configured to use a network interface. You don't tell BGP which interfaces are to participate in the routing protocol; you specifically tell BGP a peer address and AS because BGP uses TCP. If the AS is the same as the router AS, then it is iBGP, otherwise it is eBGP. 

That port is set up to be a trunk. A trunk will carry both untagged (native) and tagged frames. You will forward both VLAN 1 (untagged) and VLAN 191 (tagged) frames on that port. If you want only VLAN 1 frames on the port, you need to set it to be an access port with only VLAN 1, or remove VLAN 191 membership from the trunk, instead of a trunk with both VLANs. 

You could explicitly permit a different address and use the implicit to block everything else (it doesn't matter that the network doesn't even exit on your network): 

ICMP message are sent by a router when the router gets around to it. The primary function of a router is to route packets, not send ICMP messages. A router will put off sending an ICMP message if it is busy routing. The latency in the messages doesn't really tell you much of anything, although you may be able to infer a busy router if one of the intermediate routers has a latency higher than the end router. Traceroute is supposed to help you troubleshoot the actual path taken against what you think the path should be. 

Switches don't normally have MAC addresses assigned to the access ports because switches are transparent devices. The switch itself has one or more MAC addresses internally that it will use for things like STP. If this is a layer-3 switch, and you can change an access port into a router port, then the switch supervisor will assign a MAC address to the port. 

The isn't used for eBGP unless you use eBGP multihop (which you aren't), and it's unnecessary for your iBGP since you are not sourcing from a different interface from the one which you are using to connect the neighbors. You should remove those lines. You don't seem to be using communities, so you can lose the lines with . Normally you would have consistent communities on prefixes within your AS, and you would only use that when you need to send your communities to a different AS. Your iBGP routers should be sharing their BGP routing tables already, so the shouldn't be used within your AS, but it is often used between ASes. I'm not sure why you are prepending the same number of ASes to both the external routers. Normally you use prepending to have the external AS to prefer one of your routers over the other; you would prepend on one external link but not the other. The way you are doing doesn't seem like it accomplishes anything. Since you want to advertise aggregate prefixes, use the command. This will advertise the summary routes, and based on what you commented, I think this is your goal. The aggregate addresses will be advertised as long as there is at least one route within the summary in your routing table. the means that it will not advertise the individual routes that are within the aggregate address. I think your BGP configurations should look something like: R101: 

FHRPs, like VRRP, and HSRP, don't load balance anything; that is not their purpose. The purpose of an FHRP is to give a virtual gateway, which can fail to a different physical router in the case of a primary router failure. The gateway is either statically configured on hosts, or assigned to the hosts by DHCP. Some people will also use the assigned gateway to try to spread the traffic load across multiple routers, but that can be done with or without an FHRP. That is simply an artifact of which hosts are assigned which gateway. For example, if you have two routers and two VLANs, you can assign the hosts on VLAN 1 to use Router 1 as their gateway, and the hosts on VLAN 2 to use Router 2 as their gateway. That spreads the traffic load, but it does nothing for a failure situation. What the FHRP will do for you is create virtual router addresses. In that case, the Virtual 1 could use Router 1 as its primary router, and Virtual 2 could use Router 2 as its primary router. That would be, under normal circumstances, no different than simply using the two routers without an FHRP. What it gives you is the ability for all the traffic to use one of the routers if the other router fails. Some people take this even farther, and they assign multiple FHRP groups on the router interfaces. In such a case VLAN 1 could have two virtual router addresses on the single VLAN, and one of the virtual addresses could use Router 1 as its primary router, and the other virtual address could use Router 2 as it primary router. Some hosts would then be assigned to one virtual address as their gateway, and the other hosts would be assigned to the other virtual address as their gateway. This is what many people call load balancing, even though it is not really load balancing, and it has problems, especially if STP directs the frames to the root bridge, which then has to send them another direction to get to the router, resulting in sub-optimal traffic flow. 

The IPv6 RFC seems to say that IPv4 hosts are required to enforce the TTL, which doesn't seem to really happen: 

I think you are confusing routers and ASes. To BGP, an AS is a hop, not a router. You can try to influence a neighbor AS for which peer it uses to send traffic to your AS, but the neighbor AS is free to ignore your suggestions. It looks like your neighbor AS is following your suggestion for which of your routers it should use to get to your AS, and you could specify which of your routes could come in on which of your routers, but you cannot control routing inside the neighbor AS to the degree that you seem to want. In any case, MED wouldn't be any more effective than AS prepending. Both are pretty blunt, and neither will give you any degree of control inside the neighbor AS. You would need to work with the neighbor AS administrators to see if you could come to some arrangement. That may be using communities, or it may be something the neighbor AS administrators want to do on their own. You simply have no direct control over what happens in a different AS. That is the Autonomous in Autonomous System.
