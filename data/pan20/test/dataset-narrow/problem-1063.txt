I have two monitors and one monitor could be showing text in an app like a text editor, pdf reader, help file, web page etc.. Then I need to change focus to the app on the second monitor. Even if I have highlighted some text to remember my last position in the document, the highlight is lost when I switch focus to the app. How do I keep the highlight from being lost when losing focus?

How to open a .webarchive file in Windows? It seems to be created on Mac. Everything I read says to open it in Safari. Safari doesn't install on my Windows 10 and it's discontinued by Apple. Software I found which say they open it are all malware according to my antivirus software. Word can't open it as some sites claim. What software and open this file format safely? 

When I unzip a file into a new folder, the new folder doesn't show automatically in the folder. I have to click on the files pane and then the folder pane gets refreshed. Also when I download a file to a folder, the file doesn't show up. I sort by date and it doesn't show. I have to click on another folder and then click on the download folder for the file to show up. Is this normal behavior in Windows 7? 

I am planning to do a full installation from scratch even though I have A LOT of app installed and did a bunch of tweaks. Over the years, my computer has accumulated a lot of junk from unused files, registry keys, lots of installs and uninstalls, temp files, dup files. The best way is to start fresh and reinstall everything. The machine will be lean and clean and I am sure it will be more performant than an inplace upgrade. This is also a chance to install only the app which I will be using frequently. All trial apps, crapware, adware, viruses, plus you never know what you have hiding in your system. I know it takes longer to install the apps but you can reinstall the apps gradually over time. You can even install during web browsing, writing document. This way you don't feel you're just waiting or staring at a progress bar. Good luck. 

How to exclude every process in SysInternal's Process Monitor in the filter except for one process? Some kind of using a wildcard filter.

I didn't choose Vista (or any OS) when I created the vm. I deleted what I had and chose Vista and it worked. 

I read somewhere that an SSD can be attached to a motherboard using the PCI-Express bus without a controller. I am not sure what this means. If these are special kind of motherboards, what are some of these motherboards (brand name and model)? 

Need to empty a folder in Windows 7 from the command prompt or batch file. This means deleting all the files and all sub folders and leaving the empty folder. leaves empty subfolders so this solution doesn't work for me. I don't want to delete and recreate the folder either. 

Where are the 'I/O Read Bytes' & 'I/O Write Bytes' columns in task manager in Windows 8? In Windows 7 there was a list of columns where one can chose the columns to display. I can't find the equivalent in Windows 8? 

In Excel 2016 when I doubleclick in a cell to select some text, most of the options in the ribbon get grayed out. Why? I want to convert some text into a hyperlink and that option gets grayed out. 

Some users upload a whole album as a single mp3 file. Is there a tool for Windows which can automatically create separate mp3 files from that file? I don't want to do this manually. I don't care what the mp3 file name is nor if it has missing tags and meta info. 

I have several instances of an app open at the same time. One of them is the one I use most of often. I would like its taskbar icon to be easily identified on the taskbar. Is there any way to make it visually different than the other instances? Using Windows 7. 

My computer suddenly became sluggish. Task manager didn't help. I had lots of memory (computer has 16GB), SSD and lots of free space. CPU% was less than 5%. The last change that happened before the sluggishness was reinstalling the gfx drivers because of a gfx card issue. I removed the gfx drivers, rebooted, installed the drivers, rebooted and computer is healthy and fast. Now suppose I want to troubleshoot this in the future without knowing what has changed in advance on the computer, for example troubleshooting someone's computer. How would I troubleshoot this? How do I know if a device driver and which one is causing the sluggishness without going through something like a trial and error of uninstalling, reinstalling drivers? 

I would like to block Internet access for my own machine. This is so that no apps can talk to the outside in the time frame I want it to. I know a firewall can do this but I don't want to install one. I don't want to use the included one. I know also I can change the gateway but that involves several clicks. I am looking for a system tray software or simple desktop app to toggle the access. On/Off with a single click. 

Actually Adobe Reader works fine now. I had to uncheck the 'Only change the color text or line art" option. 

I have a wireless Logitech mouse with a USB receiver. I am trying to connect it to a Dell laptop with Windows7 64bit. The first time I put it in a USB port, Windows 7 tries to detect it and install a driver but I get a "Device driver was not successfully installed". It does this when I try other USB ports. Device manager doesn't show anything new being installed. However I can't get Windows 7 to try again if I reinsert the USB receiver. It seems Win7 either installed something or has a flag that the device doesn't work properly. I need to have Win7 in clear state as if I am putting the USB device in for the first time. How do I do this so that every time I insert the USB device, Win7 tries to install the device driver. (I don't care if it doesn't install the driver successfully at the time). I am trying to find out why it's failing and I need the details info. (I installed SetPoint, the mouse software, and the laptop still can't detect the mouse) 

I uninstalled the device's driver software (even though it's the latest) and rebooted. Windows automatically installed the device and installed the driver with my intervention and it worked. 

I am trying to uninstall an application from the add/remove applications applet. However the uninstaller is looking for the original msi installer from my temp folder. I don't have the msi file anymore and it's an older version of the app. I tried using Microsoft's installer cleaner tool but the uninstaller is stiill looking for the msi file. What's a good way to completely and cleanly remove the app? I don't want just to delete the folder and manually delete registry entries. 

I use a Firefox extension called NextPlease which allows me to use the keyboard to go to the next or previous page on web pages which have Previous/Next paging links. Like the Google search results. I downloaded a version from $URL$ for my Windows XP. On a Windows 7 FF 3.6 machine, Firefox can't import the extension because it's not compatible with FF 3.6 even though it worked in FF 3.6 in Windows XP. Is there an update to this extension or is there a similar extension? I downgraded to FF 3.5.7 to have the extension working. 

What I did is disconnected all the hard drives, rebooted Windows successfully. Shutdown, connect the drives and Windows rebooted successfully. A hard drive presence seems to have got into the way before Windows did its final setting. 

I am guessing that netstat shows apps and their ports that already have a connection and it doesn't show or can't show an app that is trying to open a connection. If I have an app that's trying to connect to the net but is blocked by a firewall, how do I know which port it's trying to use? 

The three default themes in Windows 8 show pictures of flowers or earth. How do I get a theme with just a solid color? 

I have a system with 3 SATA drives which runs fine. Got a new SSD drive and wanted to install a fresh Windows-7 on it. So I removed the boot drive and replaced it with the SSD drive. Installed Windows and when it was done, rebooted and now I get "Disk boot failure. Insert system disk and press enter" error message. I reinstall again and still same message. Removed the SSD and put back the original drive and I got the same message!! I checked the BIOS and things look good. Something is wrong. Two questions: 1- Why isn't the new Windows booting from the SSD? 2- Why isn't the machine booting using the previous working configuration anymore, after removing the SSD? I did connect it during the second Windows installation but it was the last drive in the SATA connector. Would Windows installer mess with its MBR sector? 

I have a need for a specific Windows Usenet reader which can list the post count for all the groups. Newsbin, a reader can do this but every time I try to read a message I get an error message which states it can't decode the body. I know my news server is fine because I can read messages using other readers. Anyone knows other readers which can list post counts for all the groups. The count is provided by the news server. 

I have a file explorer shell extension called "Copy File Path" or "Copy Folder Path", depending on which pane I am in in file explorer, which copies the full path of a file or a folder to the clipboard. Because it's very handy for me, I use it many times during the day. To make it more productive, I would like to assign a function key to it instead of using the right mouse click context menu, looking for it in the menu (big menu because of many extensions) and selecting it. The way I want to use it is select the file with the mouse and hit the function key. Is there a utility or tool, tray taskmaybe, which can add this functionality to Windows?
