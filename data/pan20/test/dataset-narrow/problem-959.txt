What are some Chrome extensions that provide keyboard-centric unified command prompt functionality in the style of Quicksilver for Mac or Gnome Do? Bonus points for extensions that are most versatile and free-form. 

I did a thorough (perhaps excessive) research project a few months ago to answer this question for my self. I surveyed models from the last 10 years from Lexmark, HP, Canon, Dell, Xerox (Tektronix), Okidata, Samsung, and Brother. For a modern printer at less than $300, the #1 lowest cost for all consumables (if bought on ebay) is: drumroll please HP 4600 Series (includes 4600, 4600N, 4600DN, 4600DTN, 4650, 4650N, 4650DN, 4650DTN) The only models with lower cost consumables are: 

A print cartridge comes with a count of how many pages it can print. I know the industry standard is to derive that page count from "5% coverage" of a letter-sized page. My question is, if I have four colors, how many pages is that? I have a laser printer that takes C, Y, M, and K in separate cartridges. Each one says "8000 pages". Does that mean I have 32,000 pages at 5% coverage? 

I want: a virtual server that does nothing but run a web browser and pipe I/O through VNC. For: getting a full web browser that renders fast on any device that runs a VNC client including pocketables like phones and ipods. Why: because pocketables like phones and ipods have lots of browser limitations, and they render slowly because of their slow CPUs, but they're good at decoding video for VNC. Do you know of any services or virtual server images out there that do this or similar? Bonus points: a cloud-based system for more CPU at lower cost 

I took some photos and made a huge PDF of them on Omnigraffle (OSX). Now I need to email that PDF, but since every photo is 5MB, the file is huge. I don't need the high-res photos when I email it though. So what program will take my PDF, resize all the images to low resolution and save it? 

Is there a simple turnkey app for Linux that makes a folder, say my user directory, accessible on the public internet with a nice browser-based file management interface? I'm looking for a smart, reliable solution that understands when this PC loses internet connection and seamlessly crosses whatever firewalls are in the way -- in other words, that just works. 

Giant several-thousand-dollar copiers from Canon and Xerox HP 4500 and 8500 Series (old and slow) Tektronix Phaser 740/750 Series (very old and hard to find) 

If I want to use $URL$ or other commandline dev and build tools on a ChromeBook, what's the simplest way to do so that works EXACTLY like a regular Linux environment (i.e. Ubuntu)? ... Alternatively, are there any online services that essentially let me interact with commandline tools (running on a virtual Linux machine somewhere out there) via the browser, but without me actually having to manage a virtual machine myself? 

If there's a CD in my Macbook's drive, it spins up any time I invoke the Open or Save dialog in an application. And while it spins up, it freezes the application for about 5 seconds! How do I make it stop? 

Mailing lists are great, but they're a fundamentally different beast than email. It seems strange to me to keep mailing lists in my email program (Gmail). Of course I have folders set up to automatically keep them out of my inbox, but if I have hundreds of mailing lists, it gets really out of hand. Is there an application (or web application) that is designed specifically as a mailing list "client"? 

I'm looking for a portable hard drive enclosure (2.5" notebook) that plugs into an SD card slot and LOOKS like an SD card to the camera. The obvious advantage being unlimited space for video recording. But where it really comes in handy (and crucial) is when you factor in how long it takes to transfer a giant multi-GB video file from the camera's SD card to a hard drive. As far as I can tell, the fastest possible setup maxes at about 20MB/s. (Similar to how Eye-Fi works) 

What is the most reliable way to convert any text-containing PDF to a reflowable format without errors? Including OCR'd scans? Any platforms welcome. 

I'm trying to build a 16TB RAID system on the ultra-cheap. I don't have any experience with RAID, and basically I just want low-cost, improved performance. So as far as I know, RAID 0 fits the bill. Fault tolerance would be nice but is not necessary. I know it's unwise in general, but what are the technical problems I might run into if I simply buy 8 random 2TB SATA drives on ebay? These can be had for about $50 each. Is there any reason the models need to be the same, the rotation speed needs to be the same, the SATA interface needs to be the same, the cache needs to be the same, or anything else? 

Is there any way for me to configure something so that no matter what other apps and machines are using my internet bandwidth, Wget will always get first priority? (So that even if I'm streaming lots of videos and such on other machines on my network, Wget's download speed will be limited only by the remote host and my internet connection) 

How can I get all the editing, tagging etc features of iPhoto, but see the same thing on two OSX machines? SIMPLE please! 

What is a GPU/software combination that does efficient/high-speed conversion from Motion JPEG to any high-compression/high-quality codec without using a lot of CPU? I'm working on a dSLR video workflow. 

It seems that almost every Windows audio driver has this feature: echo effects on the system output. What is there on Mac OS X? 

What are some ways of configuring an OSX box to use wideband bluetooth audio from a bluetooth headset for mono input at the same time as using the headset for mono output of system audio, and how would I do this with more than one paired bluetooth headset at a time? 

For my everyday work, I have a few DMG files that I keep on cloud storage. At the beginning of the day, I download my DMGs, convert them from Compressed to Read/Write using Disk Utility (OSX). At the end of the day, I convert them back to Compressed and upload. It might sound cumbersome, but I sort of like it. My question is, what if I ditched that workflow for something where I just download a Zip file (or something similar), unzip it, modify my files, zip it back up, and reupload it? Would I lose my file metadata or anything else useful compared to what I get by using DMGs? Are there any other options you could suggest that make it easy to download ONE compressed file, modify what's inside it, and re-upload it? Please don't suggest using Dropbox, Gdrive, etc. 

Adobe Lightroom and Ableton Live are two applications that really benefit from keyboard shortcuts. I got an Apple Bluetooth Keyboard with the intention of using it for dedicated shortcut keys for either of these apps. Unforuntately I didn't consider the obvious: OSX treats them both as a single keyboard; for example, key G on the bluetooth is the same as key G on the internal. How can I have my apps distinguish between keyboards? Preferably something that can be configured to work with any application that accepts keyboard shortcuts. $URL$ suggests keeping caps-lock on one keyboard, but this poses a problem of flexibility, and some apps cannot distinguish between uppercase and lowercase keystrokes. 

I'm looking for a Mac OSX app that simply takes a text file I've written and converts it to pretty presentation slides, preferably as a PDF. A simple markup language in the style of Markdown would be used for formatting. There are a few online programs and Ruby/Python scripts for doing something like that, and the output is typically HTML: $URL$ Is there anything like this for OSX? 

If I have clients connecting to my network (through a captive portal) over Wifi, is it technically possible for me to determine if there is a Wifi Repeater connected somewhere in the mix? If so, what is some software that can answer this question for my network?
