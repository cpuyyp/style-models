What you seem to be missing is that when you mask those addresses with your different network masks, they all arrive at the same network address: . An IPv4 address is simply a 32-bit binary number. CIDR notation gives you the mask length. When you mask (logical ) the address and mask, you get the network address. See the previous question, How do you calculate the prefix, network, subnet, and host numbers? and its excellent answer for more details. You cannot assign overlapping network addresses to router interfaces because the router would have no way to know to which interface it should send traffic destined for that network. You can, however, have multiple routes to a network with different mask lengths in a routing table. The router will look at the mask length to determine to which interface it should send traffic destined for that network. The routing table entry with the longest mask length wins. Based on what you have listed in your question, that would be . 

BPDUs are sent out all STP ports. This is because you need to detect a topology change. If the topology changes at a distant switch, the current designated or root ports may need to start blocking, and a blocking interface may need to change to a designated or root port. A switch cannot detect this on a port where it is not sending or receiving BPDUs. STP is dynamic, and it needs to detect and respond to topology changes, even from the other side of a large STP domain. In practice, you really don't want to design a large or complex STP domain, but people do, and STP needs to be able to deal with that. 

I assume you mean TCP segments. Packets don't get ACKs; IP is connectionless. Whether it is considered as having been received is a matter of perspective. Certainly, the receiver is happy to consider the TCP segment as received as soon as it gets it. On the other hand, the sender is not satisfied that any of the segments sent in a window have been received until it receives an ACK. If its timer expires before an ACK is received, it is obligated to resend the segments in the window without an ACK. 

It's true that some people do what you suggest, but security should be layered. Under typical circumstances, you will probably have more ports open on your server since you will want to be able to connect to the server to maintain it. An external firewall helps protect the rest of your network, too, and it can provide secure connectivity for other devices. A firewall can have many rules, and dedicate its computing resources to protect your whole network, rather than burdening your server's processing, freeing your server to perform it's main processing task. There are also next generation firewalls which can look deeper into the traffic to recognize application-layer protocols, traffic patterns, malware, attacks, etc., and it helps to have a dedicated box for that. Intrusion detection and prevention are hot topics today. Think about this: the bad guys will always find a way in if they are determined enough. Putting in layers of security will make their job more difficult, and you can make it difficult enough that you discourage all but the most determined. You have to weigh the risks with the resources that you are willing to put into securing your network. If you don't have much to lose, then it may not make much sense to spend a lot of time and money protecting it, but we are seeing more companies get into financial and legal trouble from data breaches (customers and governments are suing and even leveling criminal charges for data breaches). 

If a switch or the host supports SNMP, then you could use SNMP to discover such things, but that is unlikely for a dumb switch. 

Edit: What you quoted in your comment is actually on page 30, not 31. If you read it carefully, that area is performing a route summary, not to be confused with a summary LSA. You are confusing two different things. A Type-3 LSA is a summary LSA which contains all the networks for the Type-1 and Type-2 LSAs from an area. A summary route is a single, supernet route containing all the routes behind it. A summary route can only be advertised from an ABR in OSPF, but other routing protocols can use summary routes, and only OSPF uses LSAs. Yes, they Type-3 LSA would contain all the individual Type-1 LSAs for all the routes covered by the summary route if the Area was not summarizing the routes, but the Type-1 LSAs themselves would not be leaked into Area 0. 

This has to do with the algorithms used. OSPF and IS-IS use Dijkstra's algorithm which requires a hierarchy. EIGRP uses a proprietary algorithm (DUAL) which does not. The DUAL algorithm is diffusing (the "D" in DUAL) so that it doesn't require a hierarchy. EIGRP can be set up in a sort of hierarchy with stub areas, but it doesn't fundamentally need a hierarchy the way OSPF or IS-IS do. With Dijkstra's algorithm, each router has a complete understanding of an area, but DUAL only knows about the next hop for a route. 

That is so that we don't get in the same position as we are with IPv4. IPv4 ran out of addresses a long time ago, but it was extended by breaking the IP end-to-end premise with kludges like NAT. IPv6 has enough addresses that we should not get into the same position for the foreseeable future, and it restores the IP foundation of end-to-end connectivity because each device can have a unique IP address. 

You probably don't have MAC flapping on the 4948. MAC flapping is where traffic from a MAC address is originated on more than one port in a short period of time. It seems to be happening on the 3650, but not happening on the 4948. This is specific to the switch, and the error will not be sent to other network devices. That it is happening on one switch, but not the other, is a clue to help you troubleshoot where the problem may lie. This is probably caused by a layer-2 loop. You should investigate how the switches are connected, both directly and indirectly. There may be an STP misconfiguration on how the ports showing the MAC address are connected. This may be caused by someone plugging in a hub or dumb switch into multiple ports. Unfortunately, you may need physically check things out. Using portfast with BPDU guard on access ports may prevent this situation. 

Convert it back to decimal, and you have your subnet. Then you can add in the 20th bit to get the next subnet, etc. 

We have had 1 Gb, 10 Gb ethernet for a while now, and, more recently, 40 Gb and 100 Gb ethernet. Why would you think that current hardware and software can't handle another 1 Gb technology? Li-Fi will require some new hardware to transmit and receive since it is based on light instead of radio waves, but it is just an evolution of IEEE standards, not something radically different. I believe the current Li-Fi really only goes up to 96 Mb, and that is far short of 1 Gb. 

Node4 doesn't have routes to the prefixes other than its own. How does Node4 know where to send traffic for Node2's address? Routing protocols will let routers tell each the routes about which they know, so that each router knows to send traffic for a prefix in a specific direction. You can do this with static routes, but it is not scalable or dynamic. What the end nodes should have is a default route pointing to their single interface. This falls apart if they have more than one interface. The two middle nodes will need routes to the prefixes to which they don't have direct contact, and this shouldn't be done with default routes. Imagine a network with many routers where you are trying to keep up with this sort of thing. You can see why routing protocols were created. Static routing has its uses, but trying to completely run a network using is is a recipe for going insane. 

The access list is evaluated in order, and it is exited on the first match. In your particular example, if the address being evaluated is in the range, it will match the first entry, and the ACL evaluation will stop, so that the following ACL entries are not considered. 

You are confusing a couple of things: firewalls, and NAT. While it's true that you can have NAT on many firewalls, they are not even close to the same technologies. UDP hole punching is used on NAT, which may or may not be configured on a firewall or plain old router. NAT is designed for IPv4 address conservation, not security. A firewall will typically block traffic originated from an outside source. If the conversation is started from inside the firewall, the destination host outside the firewall is allowed to continue the conversation through the firewall. Many home router/NAT/firewall combinations tend to confuse people. You can usually turn off NAT if you have enough public IP addresses, but leave the firewall enabled, or vice versa. Many even allow the router and NAT to be disabled while preserving the firewall. You need to separate these disparate technologies and rethink your question. 

You can do this several ways. Probably the easiest is to get a wireless bridge and use directional antennae on both your WAP and wireless bridge. For such a short distance, It may be better just to extend the network with fiber. 

That appears to be a very strange IPv6 prefix. The IPv6 address (canonically represented by ) is the Unspecified Address. I have no idea about the mask length of that is associated with it. Valid Global IPv6 addresses are in the range , ULA addresses are in the range (with restrictions), Link-Local addresses are in the range , and multicast addresses are in the range . 

The cable category speeds are not calculated the way you seem to think. Remember that the whole world isn't ethernet, and UTP cables are used for many different things. The physical cable bandwidth is measured in Hertz (cycles per second), but the bandwidth of a protocol that runs on a cable is measured in bits per second. These values may be equal or different, depending on things like the encoding use by the protocol. Each cable category has its own frequency in Hertz. The different protocols that use a cable category will each be able to reach a certain speed (bits per second) for the protocol, based on the maximum cable bandwidth (Hertz). 

FYI, The ANSI/TIA/EIA 568, Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard actually calls for a minimum of two telecommunications outlets per work area: 

A layer-3 switch is a router, too, so it doesn't use a default gateway; it routes to other routers. It is handling the routing for your LAN, but it will have a default route pointing to your WAN router. Without including your network device configurations, it is not possible to be exact, but you probably have a VLAN from the LAN router (layer-3 switch) to the WAN router that is essentially a routed link. That would be the equivalent of a direct connection between the two devices. The network hosts would use the layer-3 switch SVIs as their gateways, and the layer-3 switch and WAN router would be configured to route between them, either with statically configured routes, or by sharing a routing protocol. 

What happens is desirable. It would not be desirable for an interface with multiple IP addresses to have the ARP cache changed every time one of the different addresses is used. The ARP cache will naturally timeout MAC addresses. You can probably clear the ARP cache, and it will get rebuilt naturally.
