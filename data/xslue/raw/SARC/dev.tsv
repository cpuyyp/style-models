cubqs1x	0	Because people like free stuff and Blizzard made the mistake of feeding them a little bit earlier,now they all came in hungry hordes and they are suprised Blizzard is not felling like giving away the freely obtainable contents for everyone... Some say hurdurr but the new players won't be able to catch up and its not actually free...but in the end if they gave away free packs to like accounts of 1 month old or less they would be even angrier because they didn't get some :P All in all since there was a precedent of getting packs free people expected the same this time and was dissapointed that they didn't get some,if there was no precedent they wouldn't had expectations... Sure I would have loved to get free packs too ,but I understand not giving away my stuff to other people,just because I did gave to some strangers some small change when they asked it does not mean I will give everytime I run into someone begging...I know it feels bad not to get the free packs,but come on people,if they give away free stuff its cool,if they don't its understandable,their game their profit,I don't go in a bar expecting to give me beer for free because they handed out free coca-cola samples at the entrance :P Brrr I expect to be downvoted for my opinion on "siding with Blizzard" but in the end I'm just accepting the facts and using common sense,no insult was meant to the dissapointed people :)
