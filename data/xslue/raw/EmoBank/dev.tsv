Nathans_Bylichka_15768_15983	2.6	3.1	3.1	I saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them, and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail.

Nathans_Bylichka_18788_18816	3.1	3.0	3.2	“What is your name, anyway?”

Nathans_Bylichka_19925_20022	2.9	2.7	2.8	When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner.
Nathans_Bylichka_21342_21360	2.18	2.91	2.82	The thing frowned.
Nathans_Bylichka_21524_21588	3.1	2.6	3.3	I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”
Nathans_Bylichka_22670_22746	2.7	3.1	2.9	There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.
Nathans_Bylichka_23337_23484	2.4	3.2	3.4	“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against.

Nathans_Bylichka_36028_36165	3.5	3.5	3.1	The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot.
Nathans_Bylichka_3636_3713	3.0	3.0	3.12	In a few minutes, we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church.

Nathans_Bylichka_43051_43191	2.7	3.1	3.1	“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.
Nathans_Bylichka_43306_43336	3.0	3.0	3.37	“So what do you need to know?”
Nathans_Bylichka_43867_44025	3.0	3.1	3.0	I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could.
Nathans_Bylichka_45828_45925	2.8	3.2	2.9	She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam.

Nathans_Bylichka_50432_50585	2.73	3.0	2.91	A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs.
Nathans_Bylichka_53937_54010	3.0	2.88	3.0	Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment.
Nathans_Bylichka_56817_56874	2.9	2.8	2.9	Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar.
Nathans_Bylichka_750_884	3.1	3.2	3.3	But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly."

Ohio_Steel_10968_11076	2.8	3.1	3.1	America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy.
Ohio_Steel_16437_16613	3.0	3.0	2.9	Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself.
Ohio_Steel_16782_16925	3.0	3.0	3.1	People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.
Ohio_Steel_18015_18138	2.2	3.2	2.7	Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others.
Ohio_Steel_18140_18288	2.62	2.88	3.0	With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures.
Ohio_Steel_20299_20483	3.1	3.2	3.3	The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on.
Ohio_Steel_2197_2827	2.63	3.12	3.0	When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry.
Ohio_Steel_3612_3754	3.1	3.0	3.0	In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”
Ohio_Steel_4537_4723	3.3	3.1	3.1	Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.

Ohio_Steel_9991_10120	2.56	2.89	3.11	Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive.
