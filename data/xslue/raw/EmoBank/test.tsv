20020731-nyt_8606_8898	3.0	3.0	3.0	Moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the Senate letter, Bill Pascoe, Forrester's campaign manager, said the findings were evidence that Torricelli had undertaken an "extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit," and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave to the panel.
20020731-nyt_8899_8997	3.11	3.0	2.89	Pascoe said, "Only then will New Jersey voters be able to decide Torricelli's fitness for office."

A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13422_13617	3.0	2.8	3.0	This is one valid criticism, but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be; rather, it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with Moore's fast pace editing.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_13908_14071	2.7	2.9	3.1	Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression.

A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_15717_15911	2.7	3.0	2.9	The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as "Hanlon's Razor" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_18399_18624	2.73	2.91	3.27	You use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader, without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_22121_22267	2.7	3.1	3.2	Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_22780_22883	2.9	2.8	3.1	Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_24040_24141	3.0	3.0	3.1	In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_24773_24854	3.0	3.1	3.2	You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_25810_25920	3.0	2.9	3.1	If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with "having a more mixed ethnicity".
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_25921_25982	2.2	3.0	3.0	Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful.
A_defense_of_Michael_Moore_27178_27354	2.6	3.0	3.1	It is not a flawless diamond -- the "48 hours" scene in particular suffers from bad editing, the statistics are suboptimal, and Heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves.

Ant_Robot_20134_20249	3.0	2.89	3.0	The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:
Ant_Robot_233_338	3.1	3.0	3.0	Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years.
Ant_Robot_23571_23723	3.0	3.0	3.12	For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed.
Ant_Robot_2835_2969	3.0	2.75	3.0	The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging.
Ant_Robot_30278_30411	3.1	3.0	3.3	This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.
Ant_Robot_35166_35264	3.0	2.6	2.9	The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:
Ant_Robot_36734_36816	3.09	2.55	3.0	Younger ants work more inside the nest, and older ants work more outside the nest.
Ant_Robot_37684_37738	3.0	2.88	2.88	A program encoding this behavior might look like this:
Ant_Robot_39217_39310	3.0	3.11	3.11	This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age.
Ant_Robot_39996_40158	3.1	2.7	3.2	To control for this behavior, Antie’s explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones.
Ant_Robot_7035_7120	3.0	3.0	3.0	In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors.
Ant_Robot_7450_7523	3.0	2.75	3.13	The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.
Anti-Terrorist_1568_1810	2.5	3.2	2.9	All of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small-time casual attacks, but they cannot stop a serious planned attack, any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious robber who really wants to get into your house.
Anti-Terrorist_4282_4370	2.7	3.1	3.2	The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous.

Bartok_11803_11928	3.0	2.88	3.0	Example 9 reproduces the chords, and Example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern.
Bartok_13137_13278	3.14	2.86	3.0	Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme.
Bartok_13279_13451	3.0	2.67	3.11	The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here.
Bartok_14880_14995	3.0	2.7	3.1	In measures 91-95, the bass descends F-E♭-D♭-C, which might seem to support C’s functioning as structural dominant.
Bartok_15911_15998	3.0	2.6	3.0	The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.
Bartok_16177_16347	3.0	2.8	3.0	Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”
Bartok_16205_16347	3.0	3.0	3.0	“[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”
Bartok_19549_19827	2.7	3.3	3.2	As tempting as this interpretation may be, this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology—there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms.
Bartok_7860_7988	2.8	2.9	2.9	As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F.
Black_and_white_10293_10380	3.12	3.38	3.37	The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them.

Black_and_white_19434_19609	2.8	2.9	2.7	Many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them.
Black_and_white_2628_2757	3.0	2.6	3.1	This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan.

Nathans_Bylichka_19397_19415	3.0	2.6	3.3	East is that way.”

Nathans_Bylichka_33848_33936	2.86	3.14	3.29	Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”
Nathans_Bylichka_3714_3798	3.88	3.63	3.5	After she paid the driver, she grabbed my arm, laughing, and we ran down the street.
Nathans_Bylichka_38116_38135	2.73	2.82	2.82	…I thought as much.

Nathans_Bylichka_38742_38816	2.88	3.12	2.75	“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me.
Nathans_Bylichka_39817_39841	3.0	2.27	3.09	The man closed his eyes.
Nathans_Bylichka_39842_39910	3.2	2.8	3.0	A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in.
Nathans_Bylichka_41005_41042	3.64	3.55	3.09	“It’s been years since I’ve seen you.
Nathans_Bylichka_41116_41254	3.0	2.88	3.12	“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk.
Nathans_Bylichka_42611_42668	3.29	3.0	3.43	“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,” I added.
Nathans_Bylichka_44283_44316	2.71	3.14	2.71	Nepthys could hardly believe her.
Nathans_Bylichka_44347_44354	3.0	2.9	2.9	“It is.
Nathans_Bylichka_44469_44528	3.2	3.1	3.2	She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs.
Nathans_Bylichka_45203_45345	2.9	2.9	3.3	She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame.
Nathans_Bylichka_48097_48178	2.8	3.3	3.5	I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him.
Nathans_Bylichka_48883_48913	2.4	2.6	2.9	He didn’t look very surprised.
Nathans_Bylichka_51042_51220	2.3	3.5	2.6	I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm.
Nathans_Bylichka_51787_51838	2.33	3.33	2.33	I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again.
Nathans_Bylichka_52337_52404	2.75	3.5	3.0	He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back.
Nathans_Bylichka_53471_53659	2.62	3.75	3.12	He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.
Nathans_Bylichka_55117_55218	2.8	3.4	2.9	He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me.
Nathans_Bylichka_55577_55633	2.6	3.4	2.8	Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand.
Nathans_Bylichka_5835_5882	2.9	2.5	3.0	He didn’t move, just stared and held his drink.
Nathans_Bylichka_5896_5943	3.0	2.9	3.0	The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving.
Nathans_Bylichka_7597_7686	1.57	4.0	2.14	My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help!

The_Black_Willow_14282_14414	2.46	3.45	2.64	Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation.
The_Black_Willow_14886_15003	2.8	3.3	3.2	I must admit, this seems far-fetched, even by your standards – even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you."
The_Black_Willow_15385_15444	2.3	3.5	3.0	With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room.
The_Black_Willow_18289_18503	3.0	3.1	3.0	He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof.
