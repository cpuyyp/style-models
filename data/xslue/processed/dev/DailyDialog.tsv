131	It's the most important thing to me .	0
132	If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?	0

134	Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .	0
135	I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .	0
136	What is your long-range objective ?	0
137	I haven't thought it over at all .	0
138	What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?	0

147	Good morning , Helen .	0

158	It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .	0
159	Is it good ?	0
160	Sure . It's a most popular dish .	0
161	I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .	0
162	We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?	0
163	What kind do you have ?	0
164	We have French and Thousand Island .	0
165	Make it Thousand Island .	0
166	Taxi !	0
167	Where will you go , sir ?	0
168	Friendship Hotel .	0
169	OK , it's not far from here .	0
170	I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?	0
171	Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .	0
172	How much should I pay you ?	0
173	The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .	0

175	Thank you very much .	4
176	Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .	0

179	Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 .	0
180	Hi , Mark .	0
181	Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .	0
182	All right .	0
183	So , what do we do now ?	0
184	This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .	0
185	Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .	0
186	Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .	0
187	Can I pay you by check ?	0
188	Sure . A check will be fine .	0

194	With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .	0
195	How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?	0
196	Five hundred yuan .	0
197	Does that include hotels and meals ?	0
198	Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .	0
199	That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?	0
200	Eight hundred and fifty yuan .	0
201	Covering all expenses ?	0
202	Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .	0
203	I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?	6
204	Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .	0
205	Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?	6
206	We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .	0
207	I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?	0
208	Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .	0
209	It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .	0
210	Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .	0

263	Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?	0
264	Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .	0
265	Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .	0
266	Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?	0
267	That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .	0
268	We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?	0
269	That sounds good .	0
270	Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?	0
271	Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .	0
272	4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .	0
273	Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .	0
274	You mean to saya	0
275	It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?	0
276	We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .	0
277	All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .	0
278	Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .	0
279	Thank you for your help .	0

287	You're right . Many ads are like that .	0

291	I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .	0
292	Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .	0
293	No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .	0
294	Why is that ?	0
295	Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .	0
296	I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .	0

302	I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .	0
303	I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !	1
304	Yes , sir ?	0

316	The cream form is very popular .	0
317	Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?	0

319	I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .	0

325	OK , no problem . To err is human .	0
326	Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .	0
327	Thank you very much .	4

361	Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?	4
362	We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .	0
363	I'll just take a cheesecake .	0
364	Will that be all ?	0
365	Yes .	0
366	Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .	0
367	Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith .	0
368	Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .	0
369	You're looking rather pale , why ?	0
370	I couldn't sleep well recently .	0
371	You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .	0
372	I always drink too much wine in the evening .	0
373	You shan't drink more wine in the evening .	0
374	Yes , you are right .	0
375	And you'd take some exercise every day .	0
376	Many thanks for your advice .	0
377	Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?	0
378	Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .	4
379	Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .	0
380	What about Rubella and Mumps ?	0
381	Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .	0
382	OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !	4
383	We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little .	0
384	I ’ m interested in teaching at your school .	0
385	Great . Are you a qualified teacher ?	0
386	Yes .	0
387	What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?	0
388	I have a TEFL certificate .	0

392	I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .	0
393	Why do you want to teach at our school ?	0
394	Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .	0
395	That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ?	0
396	Yes , just a little .	0
397	Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?	0
398	I sure can .	0
399	Great . See you then .	0
400	Why is the car before us stopping ?	0
401	What's going on ?	0
402	Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .	0
403	More and more people easily get irritated while driving .	0
404	Yes . This is what is called road rage .	0
405	This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .	0
406	That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?	0
407	3000 RIB as bonus for each person .	0
408	To encourage the staff increases .	0
409	Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .	0
410	What about the afternoon ?	0
411	At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC .	0
412	This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?	0
413	Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .	0
414	We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?	0
415	Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .	0
416	The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...	0
417	Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .	0
418	That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?	0
419	Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .	0
420	What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .	0
421	Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !	4
422	Hi , my name is Tom .	0
423	Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .	0
424	Nice to meet you too.Melinda .	0
425	Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .	0
426	Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .	6
427	Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .	0
428	It looks like you guys work hard .	0
429	I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .	0
430	Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .	0
431	Sure thing .	0
432	What do you think of our price ?	0
433	Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?	0
434	Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .	0
435	I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .	0
436	I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .	0
437	I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .	0
438	I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .	0
439	Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?	0
440	We've already cut down our price to cost level .	0
441	Is that all ?	0
442	Yes , this is the best we can do .	0
443	I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .	0
444	So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?	0
445	It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .	4
446	Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .	0
447	I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?	0
448	You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .	0
449	But what if I need my money suddenly ?	0
450	The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .	0
451	Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !	0
452	Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot	0
453	OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .	4
454	Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?	0
455	Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .	0
456	Which bus do I have to change ?	0
457	You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .	0
458	I see . Thank you .	4
459	Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .	0
460	Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?	4
461	Sure .	0
462	Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?	0
463	We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .	0
464	Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?	0
465	Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .	0
466	Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?	0
467	Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .	0
468	Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?	0
469	Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .	0
470	Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?	0
471	All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .	0
472	Okay , that's good . I get it .	4
473	Kate , you never believe what's happened .	6
474	What do you mean ?	0
475	Masha and Hero are getting divorced .	0
476	You are kidding . What happened ?	6
477	Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .	0
478	That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?	6
479	Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .	0
480	That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?	0
481	Early in the New Year I guess .	0
482	Overseas operator .	0
483	I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .	0
484	Your name , please .	0
485	Tim Chen .	0
486	What's the number , please .	0
487	The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .	0
488	The line is connected . Please go ahead .	4
489	Hello . Excuse me .	0
490	Yes . Can I help you ?	0
491	Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .	0
492	Of course I remember you .	0
493	I think I lost my wallet here .	0
494	Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .	6
495	Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?	6
496	No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?	0
497	Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?	0
498	No . It's been empty the whole time .	0
499	Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .	0
500	I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?	0
501	No . My friend did .	0
502	Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?	0
503	No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .	0
504	Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .	0
505	I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?	0
506	Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .	0
507	Should I call the police ?	0
508	You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .	0
509	Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .	0
510	I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .	0
511	Thanks for your help .	0
512	Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?	0
513	Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .	4
514	That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .	0
515	It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?	4
516	Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .	0
517	Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?	0
518	Is fifteen dollars OK ?	0
519	Have you got change for a thousand ?	0
520	Let me see .	0

524	Yes , of course .	0
525	Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?	0
526	Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?	0
527	Do you mind if I sit down ?	0
528	Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?	0
529	I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?	0
530	Yes . But why should you want to do that ?	0
531	Do you mind if I speak frankly ?	0
532	Not at all . Go ahead .	0
533	Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?	0
534	Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .	0
535	Where is that ?	0
536	Take me to the airport , please .	0
537	Are you in a hurry ?	0
538	I have to be there before 17 o'clock .	0
539	We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .	0
540	There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .	0
541	I'll do my best .	0

547	When did you last time have your eyes checked ?	0
548	Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .	0
549	Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .	0
550	All right .	0
551	Good.Now the other eye .	0
552	Well , this one is worse .	0
553	Never mind , just read as far as you can .	0
554	I can only read the first three lines .	0
555	Is there a car park near the supermarket ?	0
556	Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .	0
557	I see . Thanks .	4

561	Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .	0
562	Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?	0
563	Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !	1
564	That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?	0
565	Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !	3
566	OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .	0
567	How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?	0

599	Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .	0
600	It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .	0
601	You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .	0
602	The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .	0
603	Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .	0
604	To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .	0
605	Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .	0
606	It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .	0
607	You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .	0
608	While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately	0
609	Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .	0
610	Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .	0
611	Hello ?	0
612	Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .	0
613	What are you doing in Australia ?	0
614	I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?	0
615	Oh , right . What time is it there ?	0
616	It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?	0
617	Yes - four o'clock in the morning .	0
618	4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .	4
619	That's OK . I'm awake now .	4
620	John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?	0
621	I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .	0
622	Jack , let ’ s go !	3
623	Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?	0
624	Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !	3
625	Take it easy . They will get caught .	0
626	Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?	0

632	Excuse me , Miss .	0
633	What can I do for you ?	0
634	I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .	0
635	What's your flight number ?	0
636	Flight CA216 to Chengdu .	0
637	Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .	0
638	Could you please tell me why ?	0
639	Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .	0
640	How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?	0
641	I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .	0
642	We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?	0
643	It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .	0
644	Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !	0
645	Bye	0
646	What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !	1
647	I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .	0
648	I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !	1
649	I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?	0
650	I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .	0
651	Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?	0
652	I don't know .	0
653	I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .	0
654	What do you mean ?	0
655	We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .	0
656	I have plenty of gas .	0
657	Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .	0
658	So what can we do ?	0
659	Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .	0
660	Alright . That's a good idea .	4
661	I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .	0
662	Days ?	0
663	Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .	0
664	Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .	6
665	Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .	0
666	Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?	0
667	Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .	5
668	What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ?	0
669	No , I ’ m afraid not .	5
670	Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .	0
671	Sorry .	0
672	It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?	0
673	I wanted to see the White House .	0
674	Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .	0
675	Oh , no .	0
676	It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .	0
677	Oh , well thank you very much .	4
678	You ’ re welcome .	4
679	Can I help you ?	0
680	I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .	0
681	What kind of drink would you like with that ?	0
682	Just coke will be fine .	0
683	Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .	0
684	That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .	4
685	That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?	0
686	Yes , that's all .	0
687	That will be 25RMB , please	0
688	You got it .	0
689	Do you have any night tours ?	0
690	Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .	0
691	Is that a guided tour ?	0
692	Yes , it is .	0
693	That's fine . Let's get on the bus .	0
694	I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .	0
695	That's nice .	0
696	We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .	0
697	Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .	0
698	I would like to purchase some meat .	0
699	What kind of meat would you like to get today ?	0
700	First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .	0
701	A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .	0
702	That's perfect .	0
703	What else will you be needing ?	0
704	I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .	0
705	The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .	0
706	What's the total price for the chicken ?	0
707	It's going to be $ 12.15 .	0
708	Okay , I think that will be all for me today .	4
709	I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .	0
710	Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .	0
711	Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .	6
712	Do you sell direct to shops ?	0
713	Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .	0
714	Do you keep a stock of these things ?	0
715	In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .	0
716	That is , your commission .	0
717	Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .	0
718	Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .	0
719	The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .	0
720	According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?	0
721	We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .	0
722	We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...	0
723	Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?	0
724	Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .	0
725	Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .	0
726	Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .	0
727	Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?	0
728	Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .	0
729	All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .	0
730	Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .	0
731	Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .	0
732	Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?	0
733	Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .	0
734	Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?	0
735	Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?	0
736	Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .	0
737	Are the prices on the list firm offers ?	0
738	Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .	0
739	I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .	0
740	All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?	0
741	How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .	0
742	I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .	0
743	Hello sir , may I help you ?	0
744	Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .	0
745	I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .	0
746	Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .	4

752	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !	1
753	Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?	0
754	I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !	1
755	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	0
756	Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?	0
757	We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	0
758	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !	0
759	I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .	0
760	Yay !	4
761	Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?	0
762	Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .	0
763	From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .	0
764	I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?	0
765	Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,	0
766	So who has to stay behind ?	0
767	Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .	0
768	Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !	0
769	I want to rent this apartment .	0
770	I ’ m glad to hear that .	4
771	How much are you asking ?	0
772	You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .	0
773	I can ’ t afford that .	0
774	What can you afford ?	0
775	I was thinking $ 800 a month .	0
776	I ’ ll need you to pay more than that .	0
777	How much more ?	0
778	How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?	0
779	I can live with that .	0

825	How does the political system work in your country ?	0
826	We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .	0
827	Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?	0
828	Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist	0

928	pardon ?	6
929	i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .	0
930	well , I didn't realize that .	0
931	I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .	0
932	oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .	0
933	yes , good luck , Maria .	4

1145	Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .	0
1146	What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .	0
1147	But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .	0
1148	Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .	0

1156	Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .	0
1157	Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?	0

1435	Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .	0
1436	Do you mind if I go with you ?	0
1437	Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .	0
1438	I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .	0
1439	What happened ?	0
1440	I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .	0
1441	Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?	0
1442	Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat	0
1443	No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?	0
1444	Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho	0
1445	I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .	0
1446	I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .	0
1447	So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .	0

1456	It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .	0
1457	Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?	0
1458	Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .	0
1459	But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .	0
1460	More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .	0
1461	Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?	0
1462	It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .	0

1467	But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .	0
1468	Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .	0
1469	Can any unit see my information ?	0
1470	It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .	0
1471	Which websites offer this service ?	0
1472	Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .	0
1473	Thank you .	0
1474	Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .	1
1475	I dare you to say that again .	1
1476	Were you a leader when you were in college ?	0
1477	Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .	0
1478	Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?	0

1484	You want to argue your ticket today ?	0
1485	Yes . That is why I'm here .	0
1486	Tell me your argument .	0
1487	I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .	0
1488	Are you sure you weren't speeding ?	0
1489	To be honest , I really wasn't .	0
1490	What speed were you going ?	0
1491	I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .	0
1492	I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .	0

1494	Don't worry about it .	0
1495	I'm so glad for your help .	4
1496	Annie , do you like shopping online ?	0
1497	Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .	0
1498	Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .	0
1499	First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .	0
1500	Are there many things online ?	0
1501	Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )	0

1547	I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .	0
1548	The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .	0
1549	I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?	0
1550	You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .	0
1551	I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .	0

1635	Yes , we have it .	0
1636	Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?	4
1637	What are your thoughts on the apartment ?	0
1638	I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .	4
1639	There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?	0
1640	I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .	0
1641	What problems ?	0
1642	I did notice a few stains in the carpet .	0
1643	We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .	0

1655	OK . How much does it cost ?	0
1656	It's 486 yuan .	0
1657	Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?	0
1658	As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .	0
1659	Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .	0
1660	So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .	0
1661	The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?	0
1662	To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .	0
1663	That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .	0
1664	I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .	0
1665	Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?	0

1673	Goodbye .	4
1674	Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?	0
1675	I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .	0
1676	Late night ?	0
1677	Yeah , I got home around two .	0
1678	We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .	0
1679	I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .	0
1680	Have you got the time , Tom ?	0
1681	Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !	1
1682	But you bought it only last month .	0
1683	Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .	0
1684	How long will it take us to get there ?	0
1685	I think about ten minutes by bus .	0
1686	It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .	0
1687	Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .	0
1688	Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?	0
1689	I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .	0
1690	Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .	0
1691	I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?	0
1692	Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .	0
1693	Ok .	0
1694	Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?	0
1695	Yes .	0
1696	Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .	0
1697	I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .	0
1698	Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .	0
1699	Ok , thanks doctor .	0
1700	Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?	0
1701	I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .	0
1702	I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?	0
1703	Sure , please hold on .	0
1704	Thank you .	0
1705	Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .	0
1706	You are so kind , you helped me a lot .	4
1707	You are welcome . Bye !	4
1708	Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?	0
1709	Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .	0
1710	Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?	0
1711	I'm afraid so , yes .	0
1712	Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?	0
1713	Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .	0
1714	What do you recommend we do ?	0
1715	I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .	0
1716	I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .	0
1717	Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .	0
1718	You should go to the dentist .	0
1719	I hate dentists .	0
1720	Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .	0
1721	It always hurts . I hate going .	0
1722	Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .	0
1723	O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .	0
1724	Good . You'll feel better after you do .	0
1725	Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .	0
1726	Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .	0
1727	How long does it take to get there ?	0
1728	About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .	0
1729	Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !	0
1730	Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .	0
1731	Great ! I ’ ll take it .	4
1732	Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !	0
1733	I understand . Thank you very much !	0
1734	Have a great trip .	4
1735	I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .	0
1736	A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?	0
1737	The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .	0
1738	So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?	0
1739	It sounds like it will be .	0
1740	I really hope it doesn't get cold .	0
1741	That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .	0
1742	The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .	0
1743	That is true . The weather is constantly changing .	0
1744	It would be nice if the weather would never change .	0
1745	That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .	0
1746	True . Predictable weather would make life easier .	0
1747	Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .	0
1748	If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .	0
1749	Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .	0
1750	But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .	0
1751	I doubt that .	0
1752	Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?	0
1753	Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .	0
1754	You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .	0
1755	What's special about these things ?	0
1756	Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .	0
1757	Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .	4
1758	I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .	5
1759	You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .	0
1760	Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .	5
1761	Is that so ?	6
1762	Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .	0
1763	Have you decided ?	0
1764	Yes . I want to get a better job .	0
1765	Could you tell me why you want to quit ?	0
1766	I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .	0
1767	Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?	0
1768	I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .	0
1769	OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .	0
1770	Thank you so much for your advice .	0
1771	And every best wish for your new job .	0
1772	Thank you .	0
1773	The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?	0
1774	Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .	0
1775	Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .	0
1776	Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .	0
1777	Let's put our suitcases on the rack .	0
1778	Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .	0
1779	All right .	0
1780	So , how should we get to the theatre ?	0
1781	Let's take the bus .	0
1782	I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .	1
1783	It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .	0
1784	It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .	1
1785	We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .	0
1786	Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .	0
1787	If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?	0
1788	We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .	0
1789	I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .	0
1790	Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .	0
1791	It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .	0
1792	Thanks , that was nice of you .	4
1793	See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !	0
1794	Let's go over this plan again .	0
1795	From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .	0
1796	And that is mostly flat , right ?	0
1797	Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .	0
1798	And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?	0
1799	That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .	0
1800	It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .	0
1801	Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?	0
1802	Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?	0
1803	I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .	1
1804	I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .	0
1805	Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .	0
1806	No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .	0
1807	All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .	0
1808	Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .	0
1809	It's time for bed .	0
1810	I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .	0
1811	It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .	0
1812	I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .	0
1813	Why don't you try counting sheep ?	0
1814	I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .	0
1815	That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .	0
1816	Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?	0
1817	If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .	0
1818	I promise I'll go to sleep soon .	0
1819	No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .	0
1820	See you in the morning .	4
1821	I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .	0
1822	How about your psychological resilience ?	0
1823	I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .	0
1824	How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?	0
1825	I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .	0
1826	You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .	0
1827	Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .	0
1828	Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .	0
1829	I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .	0
1830	Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .	0
1831	Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?	0
1832	I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .	0
1833	Fine . At 3:30 ?	0
1834	I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .	0
1835	Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .	0
1836	Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .	4
1837	Nice meeting you , too .	4
1838	I made my little brother cry .	0
1839	Shame on you !	1
1840	I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?	0
1841	Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .	0
1842	Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?	0
1843	We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?	0
1844	Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .	0
1845	I can help you with that .	0
1846	Thank you .	4
1847	Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?	0
1848	Yes , we are on the same plane .	0
1849	But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .	0
1850	So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .	0
1851	Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .	0
1852	Why not go and find a porter ?	0
1853	Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .	0
1854	But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !	0
1855	You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?	0
1856	I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .	0
1857	It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?	0
1858	I bashed it against the chair in my room .	0
1859	Does it hurt ?	0
1860	A little , but not much .	0
1861	Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .	0
1862	If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?	0
1863	If you are better , but I doubt you will be .	0
1864	This is your schedule .	0
1865	You're going out of your way for us , I believe .	4
1866	You are our honored guests .	4
1867	Are there any vacancies still available ?	0
1868	Yes . We need a plumber here .	0
1869	I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .	0
1870	I am sorry . They are not available now .	0
1871	My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .	0
1872	Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .	4
1873	Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?	0
1874	Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?	4
1875	There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .	0
1876	The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?	0
1877	You know , that is one of my favorites !	4
1878	OK , I'll take one order of that .	0
1879	You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .	0
1880	Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .	4
1881	I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .	5
1882	What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?	0
1883	Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?	0
1884	Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .	0
1885	I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .	0
1886	What would you like to speak to me about ?	0
1887	I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .	0
1888	Is that right ?	0
1889	I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .	0
1890	That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .	0
1891	I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .	0
1892	That ’ s fantastic .	0
1893	Are you planning on voting ?	0
1894	I ’ m going to vote .	0
1895	Go to your polling place early on Election Day .	0
1896	I will . Good luck with your volunteering .	4
1897	We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .	1
1898	Yes . I promise it will not happen again .	0
1899	We look forward to your settlement at an early date .	0
1900	We will inform you as soon as possible .	0
1901	Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?	0
1902	Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .	0
1903	Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?	0
1904	At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .	0
1905	Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .	4
1906	Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .	4
1907	I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .	0
1908	OK , let's go .	0
1909	Where on earth are we ?	0
1910	Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .	0
1911	What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?	0
1912	I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .	0
1913	Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .	0
1914	It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .	0
1915	Hello . Front desk .	0
1916	Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .	0
1917	Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?	0
1918	Is it possible to change to another room ?	0
1919	Could you please tell me why ?	0
1920	My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .	0
1921	So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .	0
1922	You ’ re right .	0
1923	Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .	0
1924	Thank you .	0
1925	I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?	0
1926	That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?	0
1927	Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .	0
1928	Oh , thank you kindly .	4
1929	You ’ re welcome .	4
1930	How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?	0
1931	Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .	0
1932	Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .	0
1933	No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .	0
1934	Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .	0
1935	Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?	0
1936	No , nothing in particular .	0
1937	You may ask questions about us , if you have any .	0
1938	All right . When can I start ?	0
1939	What are you doing here today ?	0
1940	I would like to fight my ticket .	0
1941	Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?	0
1942	Yes , the officer is here today .	0
1943	What's your case ?	0
1944	I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .	0
1945	Do you believe that the officer lied ?	0
1946	There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .	0
1947	Your license plate was caught on camera ?	0
1948	A picture of my license plate was never taken .	0
1949	Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .	0
1950	Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .	4
1951	Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?	0
1952	Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .	0
1953	Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .	0
1954	That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .	0
1955	What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?	0
1956	Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .	0
1957	So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?	0
1958	Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .	0
1959	Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .	0
1960	After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .	0
1961	what shall we do after the volleyball match ?	0
1962	how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .	0
1963	that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .	4
1964	me , too . What did you have in mind ?	0
1965	I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .	0
1966	"I agree . They're very lovely , especially "" Huan Huan "" ."	4
1967	is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?	0
1968	the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .	0
1969	oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?	0
1970	I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .	0
1971	any other ideas ?	0
1972	there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .	0
1973	it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .	4
1974	Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !	1
1975	You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .	0
1976	Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !	0
1977	No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .	0
1978	But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !	1
1979	You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .	0
1980	Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .	0

1985	Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .	0
1986	That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .	0
1987	The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .	0
1988	Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .	0
1989	Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .	0
1990	Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .	0
1991	Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .	4
1992	Is the factory fully-automated ?	0
1993	Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .	0
1994	What about supply of parts to the production line ?	0
1995	Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .	0

2006	How many languages can you speak ?	0
2007	Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .	0
2008	You mean you can read and write both of them ?	0
2009	No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .	0
2010	Can you read and write English well ?	0
2011	I can speak the language better than read and write .	0
2012	Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?	0
2013	I think so . I used to be an interpreter .	0
2014	Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?	0
2015	The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .	0

2042	Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?	0
2043	I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .	0
2044	Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?	0
2045	Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .	0

2062	Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?	0
2063	Your assistant gave wonderful directions .	0

2065	Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .	0

2074	This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .	0
2075	And what is it regarding please ?	0
2076	We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .	0
2077	Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .	0
2078	Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .	0
2079	OK , what does that entail ?	0
2080	It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .	0
2081	Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?	0
2082	Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .	0
2083	I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?	4
2084	Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .	0
2085	Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .	4

2094	Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?	0
2095	Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .	0
2096	Is it good ?	0
2097	Sure . It is a most popular dish .	0
2098	I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .	0

2299	OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday .	0
2300	I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?	0
2301	Let me check . Yes .	0
2302	OK . I will take it .	0
2303	When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?	0
2304	I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .	0
2305	OK . No problem .	0
2306	We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this .	0
2307	OK . Let me send a memo around .	0
2308	Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .	0
2309	I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .	0
2310	Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !	0
2311	I know , it ’ s a big one .	0
2312	Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ?	0
2313	No . I don ’ t . Please .	0
2314	Are you in robust health ?	0
2315	I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .	0
2316	The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .	0
2317	Is there anything wrong ?	0
2318	We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .	0
2319	It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?	6
2320	Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally	0
2321	Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .	0
2322	Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .	0
2323	I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .	0
2324	All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .	0
2325	Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .	0
2326	Oh where was that ?	0
2327	I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .	0
2328	Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .	0
2329	Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?	0
2330	She will be 86 next month .	0
2331	That is truly amazing !	4
2332	Did you punch in ?	0
2333	Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !	4
2334	Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .	6
2335	Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?	0
2336	Sure , when those never ending meetings .	0
2337	I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .	0
2338	No , I haven't had the pleasure .	0
2339	Come and meet her now .	0
2340	All right .	0
2341	Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .	5
2342	Did you have hotel card or something ?	0
2343	Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .	0
2344	Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .	0
2345	I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?	0
2346	The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?	4
2347	I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .	0
2348	So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?	0
2349	Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .	0
2350	How long did it take you to do the tiling .	0
2351	As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .	0
2352	I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?	4
2353	You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .	4
2354	I'd like to see that pen , please .	0
2355	You mean this one ?	0
2356	No , the other one in the brown case .	0
2357	Oh , this one ... Here .	0
2358	May I try it ?	0
2359	Sure .	0
2360	It's very smooth . I'll take it .	0
2361	Cash or charge ?	0
2362	Charge , please .	0
2363	I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .	0
2364	We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .	0
2365	Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .	0
2366	I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .	0
2367	I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .	0
2368	But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .	0
2369	I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .	0
2370	There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .	0
2371	Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose .	0
2372	Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application .	0

2399	I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .	0
2400	I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?	0
2401	I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .	0

2415	Anything you need to have in the place ?	0
2416	I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .	0
2417	You can also check out university bulletin boards .	0
2418	Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?	0
2419	Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .	0
2420	Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .	4
2421	Good luck .	4
2422	Excuse me , but can I draw on my account for payment of things I buy in China ?	0

2440	A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .	0
2441	Like snacking ?	0
2442	You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...	0
2443	I get what you mean .	0

2822	Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?	0
2823	What do you need ?	0
2824	I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .	0
2825	He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .	0
2826	I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !	1
2827	Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .	0
2828	He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .	1
2829	I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .	0
2830	I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .	1
2831	Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .	0
2832	Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .	1
2833	Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .	0
2834	I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?	2
2835	I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .	0
2836	hey , you look great ! how's everything ?	0
2837	yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .	0
2838	really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .	0
2839	it's important to do proper exercises .	0
2840	you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .	0
2841	the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	0
2842	sounds reasonable .	0
2843	we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .	0
2844	and fruits !	0
2845	surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .	0
2846	I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?	0
2847	yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .	0
2848	I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .	0
2849	you bet it !	0
2850	Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .	1
2851	I stayed with my friends .	0
2852	You should at least give me a call .	1
2853	I'm sorry , Mum .	5
2854	Did anyone call ?	0
2855	Just Mr . White .	0
2856	What did he want ?	0
2857	He wouldn't say over the phone .	0
2858	What kind of job do you intend to do ?	0
2859	I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .	0
2860	What are your plans if you were hired ?	0
2861	I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .	0
2862	You stepped on my foot !	0
2863	Sorry . I didn't mean to .	5
2864	what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?	0
2865	while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .	0
2866	why not ?	0
2867	the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !	0
2868	it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .	0
2869	I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .	0
2870	I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .	0
2871	all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .	0
2872	perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .	0
2873	I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .	0
2874	that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .	0
2875	you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .	0
2876	Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?	0
2877	This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ?	0
2878	This is Chris Emerson speaking .	0
2879	Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?	0
2880	Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?	0
2881	Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .	0
2882	Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?	0
2883	No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .	0
2884	Of course , let me find one for you .	0
2885	Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?	0
2886	Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .	5
2887	Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?	0
2888	We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .	0
2889	Ok . I ’ ll take it .	0
2890	Where would you like to sit ?	0
2891	Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .	0
2892	Certainly .	4
2893	Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting .	0
2894	Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !	6
2895	Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .	0
2896	Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .	0
2897	Overseas operator , may I help you ?	0
2898	Yes . I would like to place a collect call .	0
2899	Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?	0
2900	Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .	0
2901	Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .	0
2902	Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?	0
2903	I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?	0
2904	I would like to help you with both .	0
2905	That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?	0
2906	A dressy party would be fun !	0
2907	That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?	0
2908	We should probably have both .	0
2909	Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?	0
2910	Maybe we could do both !	0
2911	Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .	4
2912	I can't find the price tag .	0
2913	It's right here . $ 100 .	0
2914	But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .	0
2915	Ours are of really good quality .	0
2916	I see , please wrap it .	0
2917	Peter , how often do you exercise ?	0
2918	Well , I swim and run every day .	0
2919	Now , tell me , what do you eat ?	0
2920	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .	0
2921	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	0
2922	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .	0
2923	What do you drink ?	0
2924	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .	0
2925	What do you drink ?	0
2926	Where can I call a taxi ?	0
2927	There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .	0
2928	How did your company's fundraiser go ?	0
2929	The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .	0
2930	So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?	0
2931	Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .	0
2932	Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .	0
2933	In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .	0
2934	How may I help you today ?	0
2935	I need to open a second account .	0
2936	What kind of account would you like to open ?	0

3087	Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .	0
3088	Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .	4
3089	Good morning . Wilson Association .	0
3090	This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .	0
3091	I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .	0
3092	That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?	5
3093	I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .	0
3094	Is there anywhere I can reach him ?	0
3095	I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?	0
3096	I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .	0
3097	Would you care to make another appointment ?	0

3103	There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .	0
3104	I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .	0
3105	Which tests do you mean ?	0
3106	You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”	0
3107	Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .	0
3108	Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .	0

3157	Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .	0
3158	What's the answer ?	0
3159	We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .	0
3160	Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?	0
3161	Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .	0
3162	I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .	0
3163	Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .	0
3164	By all means .	0
3165	Be careful . The floor is wet .	0

3178	What are we eating for lunch ?	0
3179	I have no idea . What about you ?	0
3180	I kind of want pizza .	0
3181	I ate pizza the other day .	0
3182	So , what do you feel like eating then ?	0
3183	How about some burgers ?	0
3184	I already had a burger yesterday .	0
3185	What are we going to do ?	0
3186	We can just each get what we want to get .	0
3187	That sounds like a plan .	4
3188	Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?	0
3189	I think they sell both at the cafeteria .	0
3190	Did you bring your certificate for nursing ?	0
3191	Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .	0
3192	How about your nursing education ?	0
3193	I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .	0
3194	Can you manage English conversation ?	0
3195	Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .	0
3196	Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?	0
3197	My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl	0
3198	Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?	0
3199	For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .	0
3200	Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?	0
3201	No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy	0
3202	If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?	0
3203	That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like	0
3204	Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?	0
3205	I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !	0
3206	Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !	0
3207	I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .	0
3208	Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .	0
3209	So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?	0
3210	Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .	0
3211	Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?	4
3212	No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .	0
3213	You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .	0
3214	Is Tom in ?	0
3215	No , he is at work now .	0
3216	May I have his office phone number please ?	0
3217	Sure . It's 289,1234 .	0
3218	What about driving to Shanghai ?	0
3219	Driving ? No way , it's too far .	0
3220	I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?	0
3221	Too long , and you do not have much time .	0
3222	What a pity .	5
3223	Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room .	0
3224	Thank you .	0
3225	Could you tell me which bags are yours ?	0
3226	They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .	0
3227	Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?	0
3228	Sure , here it is .	0
3229	Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .	0
3230	Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ?	0
3231	Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .	0
3232	Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .	5
3233	Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?	0
3234	The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .	0
3235	How long will it take me to get there ?	0
3236	It's about a ten-minute walk .	0
3237	That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .	4
3238	Not at all .	4
3239	Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ?	0
3240	No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .	0
3241	OK ! Thank you very much !	4
3242	I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .	0
3243	Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .	0
3244	Take your time .	0
3245	I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .	0
3246	I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .	0
3247	We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?	0
3248	Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .	0
3249	The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .	0
3250	Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .	0
3251	When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .	0
3252	How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?	0
3253	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .	0
3254	Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?	0
3255	I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?	0
3256	Very well , I will .	0
3257	Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?	0
3258	Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .	4
3259	Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .	0
3260	Right ? OK , got it .	0
3261	Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?	0
3262	Next left then right ? OK .	0
3263	I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .	0
3264	I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '	0
3265	I'm trying to find a post office .	0
3266	Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .	0

3333	When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .	0
3334	Then say it .	0
3335	When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .	0

3367	Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ?	0
3368	Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?	0
3369	Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .	0
3370	Is there any flexibility on that ?	0
3371	Unfortunately , not .	0
3372	OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .	0
3373	Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .	0
3374	Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you .	0
3375	All right . Please read it to me .	0

3384	The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .	0
3385	I see , and what about the keyboard ?	0
3386	I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .	0
3387	I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .	5
3388	Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .	1
3389	There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out !	0
3390	Luckily we got the last two .	0
3391	Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !	6
3392	Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .	0
3393	I really admire those who made such great inventions !	0
3394	May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .	0
3395	They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .	0
3396	Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .	6
3397	Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .	0
3398	Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .	0
3399	No , quite the contrary .	0
3400	Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?	0
3401	Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .	0
3402	Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .	0
3403	What can I do for you ?	0
3404	I need some medicine .	0
3405	For whom ?	0
3406	My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .	0
3407	What symptoms does she have ?	0
3408	Fever and a bad cough .	0
3409	I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .	0
3410	What kind of medicine does she need ?	0
3411	Patulin will be enough .	0
3412	How many pills for each time ?	0
3413	Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .	0
3414	Thank you very much .	0
3415	It's my pleasure .	0
3416	Do you believe in god ?	0
3417	Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?	0
3418	I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ?	0
3419	I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .	0
3420	I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .	0
3421	I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .	0
3422	For example ?	0
3423	Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .	0
3424	Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .	0
3425	Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ?	0
3426	They're going skiing in Colorado .	0
3427	What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !	4
3428	You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .	4
3429	What a terrible house !	1
3430	I'm sick of it , too .	0
3431	The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .	1
3432	It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .	0
3433	Sure .	0
3434	Hello !	0
3435	Is that Sue ?	0
3436	Speaking .	0
3437	A.This is George .	0

3455	That'll be fine .	0

3459	Yes .	0
3460	How many do you want ?	0
3461	I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .	0

3464	Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !	4
3465	I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .	4

3467	Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .	4
3468	I agree .	0
3469	I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ?	0

3482	Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?	4
3483	Anytime you like .	0
3484	OK .	4
3485	Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ?	0

3495	Hi there . Welcome to Lincoln Corporate Services . How can we help ?	0
3496	Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?	0
3497	Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .	0
3498	That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .	0
3499	There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like .	0
3500	That's what I am going to do .	0
3501	If you have any problem , please come to me .	0

3503	You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .	0
3504	That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?	0
3505	Do you have any special request ?	0
3506	I'd like to see some traditional arts .	0
3507	So that means you are shopping for presents ?	0
3508	Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .	0
3509	Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .	0
3510	Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .	4
3511	I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .	0
3512	You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .	0
3513	As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .	0
3514	Wow , you are the expert on it .	4
3515	Operator . Can I help you ?	0

3522	What the number I gave you , operator ?	0
3523	It's 2135-3678 .	0

3541	Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days .	0
3542	That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?	0
3543	Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .	0
3544	That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?	0
3545	The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .	0
3546	Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .	0
3547	Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .	0
3548	Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .	0
3549	I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .	0
3550	Did you ever get a parking ticket ?	0
3551	Only a few .	0
3552	What's a few ?	0
3553	I've gotten six , I think .	0
3554	Did you pay your fines ?	0
3555	Of course I have .	0
3556	How much are the parking tickets ?	0
3557	I think they're $ 130 .	0
3558	That's expensive .	0
3559	I just got a parking ticket .	0
3560	You should probably pay the fine soon .	0
3561	I'm going to pay it today .	0
3562	Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?	0
3563	I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?	0
3564	Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?	0
3565	Is it urgent ?	0
3566	Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .	0
3567	Ok , I am coming .	0
3568	Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?	0
3569	Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?	0
3570	No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .	0
3571	All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .	0
3572	Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .	0
3573	Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?	0
3574	Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .	0
3575	You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?	0
3576	Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .	0
3577	You're finally here ! What took so long ?	4
3578	I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .	0
3579	It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .	0
3580	I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .	0
3581	perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .	0
3582	I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .	0
3583	It would be better for the environment , too .	0
3584	I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .	0
3585	Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .	0
3586	The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .	0
3587	Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .	0
3588	That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !	4
3589	So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?	0
3590	Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .	0
3591	That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .	0
3592	I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .	0
3593	That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .	0
3594	Sure , for at least three thousand per month .	0
3595	That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .	0
3596	I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .	4
3597	Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready ?	0
3598	They'll be ready by this afternoon .	0
3599	Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .	6
3600	Is that right ? We're very sorry .	5
3601	"I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway , please do hurry ."	0
3602	I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .	5

3630	It seems that many boys are fighting there .	0
3631	Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .	1
3632	the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !	1
3633	exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .	0
3634	on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .	1
3635	as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .	0
3636	I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse	0
3637	what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?	0
3638	it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .	0
3639	I see , so it's similar to global warming ?	0
3640	they're related to one another , yes .	0
3641	I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .	0
3642	people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .	0
3643	people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .	0

3662	I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?	0
3663	That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .	0
3664	These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .	4

4101	What about the loan repayment ?	0
4102	You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .	0
4103	Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?	0
4104	Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .	0
4105	That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .	4

4108	That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?	0
4109	We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .	0
4110	Where do you think you have problems ?	0
4111	There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .	0

4127	Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .	0
4128	Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?	4

4140	Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .	0
4141	I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?	0
4142	Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?	0
4143	Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .	0
4144	We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .	0
4145	That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?	4
4146	Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?	0
4147	I like the red one . What do they eat ?	0
4148	You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .	0
4149	Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .	4
4150	That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .	0
4151	I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .	0

4159	Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off .	0
4160	I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .	0
4161	Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .	0
4162	I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?	0
4163	No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention	0

4379	What was taken ?	0
4380	My wallet and cell phone .	0

4385	Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .	0
4386	Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?	4
4387	Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .	0
4388	I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .	0
4389	But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .	0
4390	Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .	0
4391	Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .	1
4392	Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?	0
4393	Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .	0
4394	I see . And how about the working hours ?	0
4395	Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .	0
4396	Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .	0
4397	Good , as long as you understand that .	0
4398	And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?	0
4399	Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .	4
4400	That sounds ideal .	4
4401	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?	4
4402	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	4
4403	Nice ! Brunch !	4
4404	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	4
4405	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	4
4406	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .	4
4407	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .	4
4408	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !	4
4409	Come on , fellows . Let's enjoy my wife's cooking !	4
4410	Em , it's delicious !	4

4601	I ’ m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?	0
4602	That ’ s fine . Thanks .	0
4603	You ’ re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?	0
4604	Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .	0
4605	Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .	0
4606	Thank you very much .	0
4607	You ’ re welcome .	0
4608	What do you think of the project ?	0
4609	Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us .	0
4610	Are you interested in making this investment ?	0
4611	We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .	0
4612	David , how is your interview ?	0
4613	I was nervous at that time . What about you ?	0
4614	Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams .	0
4615	We can have a rest now after this tough interview .	0
4616	Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .	0
4617	Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?	0
4618	Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .	0
4619	I am getting to know your meaning .	0
4620	Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it .	0
4621	When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?	0
4622	My appointment was on Wednesday .	0
4623	At what time was that appointment ?	0
4624	It was for 4	0
4625	I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ?	0
4626	I want to change to next Tuesday .	0
4627	What time would you prefer ?	0
4628	I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .	0
4629	I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .	0
4630	Can I help you ?	0
4631	En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?	0
4632	There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .	0
4633	What's the charge ?	0
4634	Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .	0
4635	Thank you .	4
4636	Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?	0
4637	Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .	0
4638	Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?	0
4639	Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .	0
4640	I didn ’ t pay attention to that .	0
4641	Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?	0
4642	It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .	0
4643	We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .	0
4644	Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .	0
4645	That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .	0
4646	Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .	6
4647	So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?	0
4648	I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .	0
4649	Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?	0
4650	The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .	0
4651	We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .	0
4652	Did you hear about Lulu ?	0
4653	No , what ?	0
4654	She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer .	0
4655	Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !	6
4656	No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .	0
4657	Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ?	0
4658	Well , I'm not too happy about it .	0
4659	What's wrong with it ?	0
4660	Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .	0
4661	Oh , dear !	6

4671	that's OK . Is breakfast included ?	0
4672	yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .	0
4673	fantastic . Thank you very much .	0
4674	you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .	0
4675	I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted .	0
4676	You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .	0
4677	You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .	5
4678	What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ?	0
4679	Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .	0
4680	What about things other than food ?	0
4681	Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .	0
4682	Are there small shops near here as well ?	0
4683	Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .	0
4684	Well , that sounds just wonderful .	4
4685	Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .	4
4686	Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .	0
4687	Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .	0
4688	But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .	0
4689	But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .	0
4690	Well , only you liked it really , darling .	0
4691	Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .	0
4692	Hi , Bob , everything okay ?	0
4693	More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .	0
4694	Oh ? What's that ?	6
4695	Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .	0
4696	What gift ?	0
4697	It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .	0
4698	You refused the gift ? That's terrible .	6
4699	I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .	0
4700	Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .	0
4701	That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .	0
4702	I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet .	0
4703	We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .	0
4704	Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?	0
4705	You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .	0
4706	Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?	0
4707	The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .	0
4708	Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?	0
4709	The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .	0
4710	Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .	4
4711	Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .	0
4712	Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application .	0
4713	OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .	0

4730	Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?	0
4731	It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .	0
4732	Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?	0
4733	In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .	0

4848	Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?	0
4849	Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .	0
4850	What seems to be the problem ?	0
4851	I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .	0
4852	Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?	0
4853	No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !	6
4854	You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?	0
4855	Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?	0
4856	Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .	0
4857	Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .	4
4858	Can you manage chopsticks ?	0
4859	Why not ? See .	0
4860	Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?	4
4861	Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .	4
4862	What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .	6
4863	According to some studies it may cause cancer .	0
4864	Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .	0
4865	I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .	0
4866	I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .	0
4867	Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?	0
4868	It was a nightmare .	5
4869	What ’ s up ?	0
4870	Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .	0
4871	Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?	0
4872	Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .	5
4873	This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?	0
4874	I am still waiting for their call .	5
4875	Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .	0
4876	Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?	0
4877	Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?	0
4878	Yes . Would you like a window seat ?	0
4879	If one's available , please . But not over the wing .	0
4880	morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?	0
4881	Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .	0

4883	Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .	0
4884	I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .	0
4885	Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?	0
4886	It was for my Master Card .	0
4887	You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .	0
4888	I haven't got it in the mail yet .	0
4889	The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .	0
4890	What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?	0
4891	Maybe you should call your post office .	0
4892	But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?	0
4893	Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .	0
4894	Okay , thank you very much for your help .	0
4895	Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .	0
4896	Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?	0
4897	Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .	0
4898	Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .	0
4899	What a shame that we can't take pictures .	0
4900	OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ?	0
4901	I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?	0
4902	Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !	1
4903	I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .	0
4904	"Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves "" The King . """	0
4905	I'll put the song at the front of the list .	0
4906	Here is the document you asked for this morning .	0
4907	Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .	4
4908	You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .	0
4909	This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?	4
4910	The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .	0
4911	Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .	4
4912	How are you doing , Jim ?	0
4913	Fine , just fine.How about you ?	0
4914	Not too bad .	0
4915	I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .	4
4916	Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .	4
4917	What's for lunch ?	0
4918	Pork chops .	0
4919	What happened to you ?	0
4920	I think I caught a cold .	0
4921	Do you have any symptoms ?	0
4922	Runny nose and coughing .	0
4923	Do you have a fever ?	0
4924	I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .	0
4925	It's not serious .	0
4926	Are you sure ?	0
4927	Yes .	0
4928	What should I do ?	0
4929	You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .	0
4930	What kind of place shall we rent ?	0
4931	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	0
4932	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	0
4933	Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .	0
4934	I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	0
4935	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	4
4936	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	0
4937	How much do you think the rent will be ?	0
4938	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .	0
4939	I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .	0
4940	Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?	0
4941	The earliest we can do is by the end of June .	0
4942	Did you have any working experience during college ?	0
4943	Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .	0
4944	What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?	0
4945	I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .	0
4946	Smells good ! What ’ s for breakfast ?	4
4947	Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !	4
4948	Nice ! Brunch !	4
4949	Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !	4
4950	Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?	4
4951	Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .	0
4952	Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .	4
4953	Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !	0
4954	Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ?	0
4955	Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .	0
4956	So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?	0
4957	Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .	0
4958	Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me ?	0
4959	Would you turn off the tap ?	0
4960	I did it .	0
4961	Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?	0
4962	OK . I will .	0
4963	I'll have our housekeeper come right away .	0
4964	I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .	0
4965	When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .	0
4966	Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?	0
4967	Would you like some more coffee ?	0
4968	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	0
4969	The waitress is bringing the bill right now .	0
4970	This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?	0
4971	Yes , this waitress did a great job .	0
4972	OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .	0
4973	What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?	0
4974	Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?	0
4975	Yes , 20 % would be perfect .	0
4976	Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .	0
4977	Yes , that was one fantastic meal !	4
4978	I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .	4
4979	It ’ s time for me to go now .	0
4980	Would you like me to go with you ?	0
4981	I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .	0
4982	Do you want to type that letter ?	0
4983	I ’ d rather you typed it .	0
4984	Do you want to tell her ?	0
4985	I ’ d rather you told her .	0
4986	Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head .	0
4987	What crime did I commit ?	0
4988	You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?	0
4989	I am innocent .	0
4990	Would you like to come by and play bridge ?	0
4991	Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .	0
4992	Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .	0
4993	Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .	0
4994	Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?	0
4995	Well , do you have any suggestions ?	0
4996	Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?	0
4997	It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .	0
4998	Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .	0
4999	OK .	0
5000	Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?	0
5001	Tom , it's time for you to go to bed .	0
5002	Good night , mum .	0
5003	Good night .	0
5004	Operator . May I help you ?	0
5005	Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?	0
5006	Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .	0
5007	No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .	4
5008	What's our target audience for this campaign ?	0
5009	This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .	0
5010	Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?	0
5011	Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .	0
5012	Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?	0
5013	Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .	0
5014	John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute .	0
5015	Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .	0
5016	John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .	0
5017	Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .	4
5018	Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .	0
5019	Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .	6
5020	You've earned it .	0
5021	How can I help you today ?	0
5022	I am returning something that I bought yesterday .	0
5023	What would you like to return ?	0
5024	I'm returning a cellphone .	0
5025	Was there something wrong with it ?	0
5026	It's defective .	0
5027	What isn't working on it ?	0
5028	It keeps turning off on it's own .	0
5029	Alright , do you have the receipt ?	0
5030	I have it right here .	0
5031	I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .	0
5032	Thanks for your help .	4
5033	I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday .	5
5034	Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .	0
5035	Good morning , sir . Can I help you ?	0
5036	Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .	0
5037	Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?	0
5038	What about the driving license ?	0
5039	Don't you have any other identification ?	0
5040	I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .	0
5041	Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?	0
5042	Thank you . Here you are .	0
5043	How do you want your money ?	0
5044	Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?	0
5045	All right . Please wait for a moment .	0
5046	Could you fill in this form , please ?	0
5047	All right .	0
5048	Have you got any identification ?	0
5049	Yes , here's my ID card .	0
5050	Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !	1
5051	What ? What did you buy ?	0
5052	It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !	1
5053	What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?	0
5054	There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .	0
5055	And ?	0
5056	So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .	0
5057	And it's a brick ?	0
5058	Yes .	0
5059	I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?	0
5060	I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .	0
5061	So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .	0
5062	Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .	0
5063	But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?	0
5064	He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .	0
5065	Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !	0
5066	C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .	0
5067	That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .	0
5068	You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?	0
5069	Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?	0
5070	Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .	0
5071	Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .	0
5072	Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .	0
5073	Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat !	6
5074	Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .	5
5075	Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .	0
5076	Thanks doc !	0
5077	Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom .	0
5078	Would you like some more coffee ?	0
5079	No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .	0
5080	Good luck finding the waitress !	0
5081	The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?	0
5082	I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .	0
5083	Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .	0
5084	So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .	0
5085	How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?	0
5086	I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .	0
5087	I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .	0
5088	I think that we should leave 10 % .	0
5089	$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .	0
5090	I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th .	0
5091	Let me see what's available .	0
5092	By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .	0
5093	Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .	0
5094	That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .	0
5095	How much was your watch ?	0
5096	Take a guess .	0
5097	A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too .	5
5098	Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?	0
5099	Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .	0
5100	Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .	0
5101	But I'm going on a business trip in two days !	6
5102	Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .	0
5103	Would you care for a drink ?	0
5104	No , thanks . I'm fine .	0
5105	Let's go practice your driving .	0
5106	If that's what you want to do , then we can .	0

5109	You need to start the car now .	0
5110	What do you want me to do ?	0
5111	Go left .	0
5112	How far should I go ?	0
5113	I'll let you know when I want you to stop .	0
5114	Tell me before you want me to stop .	0
5115	All right , try parking here .	0
5116	Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .	4
5117	How may I help you ?	0
5118	I ’ m making a deposit today .	0
5119	Cash or check ?	0
5120	I would like to deposit a check .	0
5121	You need to sign the back .	0
5122	Okay . Here you go .	0
5123	Would you like cash back ?	0
5124	Yes , I would .	0
5125	How much ?	0
5126	Let me get $ 150 back .	0
5127	Here you go .	0
5128	Thank you . Have a good one .	4
5129	I'd like to extend my visa for another two years .	0
5130	Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?	0
5131	Student visa .	0
5132	What is the reason for extension ?	0
5133	I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .	0

5136	I absolutely love the apartment .	4
5137	Everything is okay ?	0
5138	I do have one problem with the apartment .	0
5139	What ’ s the problem ?	0
5140	I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .	0
5141	We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .	0
5142	I did not know that .	0
5143	I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .	0
5144	That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .	0
5145	I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .	4
5146	It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .	4
5147	Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .	0
5148	Good morning .	0
5149	Would you like something to drink ?	0
5150	No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .	0
5151	So , you're a serious coffee drinker .	0
5152	Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .	0
5153	Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?	0
5154	No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .	0
5155	Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?	0
5156	I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .	0
5157	I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .	0
5158	It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .	0
5159	Yes .	0
5160	Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .	0
5161	What do you suggest ?	0
5162	The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .	0
5163	You mean because people have to go across town to get here .	0
5164	Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .	0
5165	That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .	0
5166	I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .	0
5167	I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .	0
5168	Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .	0
5169	Well .	0
5170	I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .	0
5171	You mean you want to run the meetings ?	0
5172	No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .	0
5173	Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .	0
5174	I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .	0
5175	I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .	0
5176	Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .	4
5177	"I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this "" new style . """	0

5208	what currency would you like to trade in ?	0

5210	No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?	0
5211	Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?	0
5212	It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?	0
5213	I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !	0
5214	Has your son started school yet , Tom ?	0

5303	We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .	0
5304	You got lost . You're kidding !	6
5305	No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .	0
5306	You could have called .	0
5307	I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .	0
5308	You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?	6
5309	Guess where we ended up .	0

5312	Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?	6
5313	I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .	0
5314	Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .	0
5315	I know it is . I don't know how it happened .	0
5316	Hmm , maybe I do .	0
5317	What ?	0
5318	Maybe I have an idea how it happened .	0

5329	You Americans usually have nutritious food .	0

5337	Do you have experience in advertising ?	0
5338	Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .	0

5341	What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?	0

5361	How often must I take it ?	0
5362	Three times a day after meals .	0

5389	Can you develop the roll of film ?	0
5390	Sure .	0

5394	Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough .	0
5395	I think my husband has some .	0
5396	Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .	0
5397	That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself .	0
5398	Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?	0

5422	Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .	0
5423	I have to admit it's easier said than done .	0
5424	Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .	0
5425	But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .	0
5426	You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .	0
5427	Actually , my doctor said the same thing .	0
5428	Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market .	0
5429	Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?	0

5450	Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .	0
5451	Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .	0

5479	My name's Donald Eakins .	0
5480	How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .	0
5481	It's E-A-K-I-N-S .	0
5482	E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?	0

5498	When are you going to go get it ?	0
5499	I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .	0
5500	Why didn't you just ask me ?	0
5501	Where should I go ?	0
5502	You can get one from student services .	0
5503	I had no clue that I could get it there .	0
5504	I already knew that .	0
5505	Thanks for letting me know .	4
5506	You're welcome .	4
5507	I'm going to go and get it right now .	0
5508	Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?	0
5509	Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code .	0
5510	Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .	0
5511	Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .	0
5512	Excuse me . Will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? I just want to make a phone call .	0

5520	Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer .	0
5521	How about two inches ?	0
5522	That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .	4
5523	I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .	0
5524	All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .	0
5525	Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .	4
5526	OK .	0
5527	Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .	1
5528	How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?	0
5529	There are just too many people , and too many cars .	0

5546	No , it ’ s 777-9344 ?	0
5547	Oh , I ’ m so sorry .	5
5548	That ’ s OK .	4
5549	Put all baggage on the conveyor belt . Walk through the detector age one at a time , please .	0

5569	That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?	0
5570	They are in the basement already .	0
5571	But I didn't see you carry them down .	0
5572	Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ?	0
5573	Hi , John .	0
5574	Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?	0
5575	Oh , no problem .	0
5576	Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?	4

5738	Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?	0
5739	No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever .

5740	Thank you very much , doctor .	0
5741	Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ?	4
5742	Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !	4
5743	Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun !	4

5759	Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .	0
5760	You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?	0

5858	Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .	0

5871	Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .	0
5872	I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?	0
5873	I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .	0
5874	How can we get up there ?	0
5875	You can take a bus .	0
5876	But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .	0
5877	Finally we have a long holiday .	0
5878	Yes , what about us having a tour ?	0
5879	Good idea . Where shall we go ?	0
5880	How about Milan ?	0
5881	Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ?	0

5917	I can't afford it .	0

6262	I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .	0
6263	I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .	0
6264	Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?	0
6265	Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .	0
6266	A ticket to London , please .	0
6267	A cheap day return ticket ?	0
6268	Yes , including London Tube .	0
6269	That'll be twelve pounds .	0
6270	Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?	0
6271	Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .	0

6278	Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?	0
6279	As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .	0
6280	Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?	0
6281	I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )	0
6282	B , should we get a maid ?	0
6283	I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .	0
6284	You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .	0
6285	We really don't need to .	0
6286	You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .	0
6287	Give me some time to think about it .	0
6288	Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?	0
6289	Certainly . How do you like your room ?	0
6290	I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?	0
6291	$ 40 per night .	0
6292	Is there anything I can do for you ?	0
6293	Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .	0
6294	I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .	5
6295	That's all right .	0
6296	Have you graduated now ?	0
6297	Yes . I graduated this past June .	0
6298	Which university did you graduate from ?	0
6299	Guangzhou University .	0
6300	What degree did you receive ?	0
6301	I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .	0
6302	What courses did you take in college ?	0
6303	My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English	0
6304	Why did you choose to study Economics ?	0

6306	Can you speak other languages except English ?	0
6307	I can also speak a little Japanese .	0
6308	I am very satisfied with your answers .	4
6309	Thank you very much .	4
6310	Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .	0
6311	OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will .	0
6312	Take care of yourself .	0
6313	Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner .	0
6314	Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?	0
6315	Maybe I will be around later .	0
6316	Okay , I'll see you later .	0
6317	I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .	5
6318	Well , sir . May I have your room number ?	0
6319	503 . I would like to pay for it .	0
6320	Please fill out the form first .	0
6321	OK , can you bring me a new one ?	0
6322	Of course .	0
6323	Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .	0
6324	It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .	0
6325	Yes , I need to refill it today .	0
6326	Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .	0
6327	I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .	0
6328	Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .	0
6329	Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?	0
6330	I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .	0
6331	But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .	0
6332	Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .	0
6333	But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .	0
6334	A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .	0
6335	Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .	0
6336	Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .	0
6337	This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .	1
6338	Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .	0
6339	What are you doing ?	0
6340	I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .	0
6341	Let regive you a hand .	0
6342	No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .	0
6343	There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .	0
6344	Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .	0
6345	I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .	0
6346	Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .	0
6347	That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .	0
6348	Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .	0
6349	Ahhchooo !	0
6350	You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?	0
6351	No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .	0
6352	I never have seasonal allergies .	0
6353	Consider yourself lucky .	0
6354	What are all the symptoms ?	0
6355	Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .	0
6356	That doesn't sound good .	0
6357	No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?	0
6358	Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .	0
6359	Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .	0
6360	I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .	0
6361	That's pretty bad .	0
6362	But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .	4
6363	Let's have a look at the map first .	0
6364	All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .	0
6365	Let's buy some tickets .	0
6366	The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train	0
6367	Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?	0
6368	No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .	0
6369	What do you do ?	0
6370	I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .	0
6371	I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?	0
6372	Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .	0
6373	Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .	0
6374	What about cats ? They are more independent .	0
6375	Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .	0
6376	How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?	0
6377	Yeah , are they easy to look after ?	0
6378	Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .	0
6379	Can I be of any service to you ?	0
6380	I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?	0
6381	There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?	0
6382	No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .	0
6383	I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .	0
6384	So , we'd like to see some embroidery .	0
6385	Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?	0
6386	I had some bread for breakfast .	0
6387	Let's go out for brunch .	0
6388	Brunch ?	0
6389	It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .	0
6390	Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .	0
6391	Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ?	0
6392	My name is Jeff .	0
6393	What do you do ?	0
6394	I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ?	0

6399	Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ?	4
6400	Anywhere with you .	0
6401	Aren ’ t you sweet .	4
6402	Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?	0
6403	Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .	0
6404	They are both spicy hot , I've heard .	0
6405	That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .	0
6406	They might be too hot for me .	0
6407	Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .	0
6408	What about any special Beijing dishes ?	0
6409	There's the Beijing roast duck .	0
6410	Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?	0
6411	You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .	0
6412	Is it near here ?	0
6413	Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .	0
6414	Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?	0
6415	Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .	0
6416	That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .	4
6417	hi , Isaiah . How are you ?	0
6418	I ’ m well . And you ?	0
6419	fine . How ’ s your job going ?	0
6420	I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .	0
6421	really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?	6
6422	I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .	0
6423	how ’ s it going ?	0
6424	it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !	4
6425	that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?	4
6426	our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon .	0
6427	where will those be located ?	0
6428	if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .	0
6429	when will you find out ?	0
6430	we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .	0
6431	well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !	4
6432	thanks !	4
6433	Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?	0
6434	Pretty well . What about you ?	4
6435	Fine . Where are the other guys ?	0
6436	It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .	0
6437	Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?	0
6438	Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?	0
6439	Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .	0
6440	Did you go to a real estate agent ?	0
6441	No , that will be too expensive .	0
6442	That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?	0
6443	My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .	0
6444	Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .	4
6445	I'll appreciate it so much .	4
6446	Good afternoon .	0
6447	My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .	0
6448	Thank you .	4
6449	What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped .	0
6450	It ’ s half past twelve .	0
6451	When do you have lunch ?	0
6452	From one to two .	0
6453	What do you normally eat ?	0
6454	We usually go to the cafeteria .	0

6462	Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?	0
6463	Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .	4
6464	No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .	0
6465	Thanks million .	4
6466	My pleasure .	4
6467	There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?	0
6468	Use them from the outside in .	0
6469	I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .	0
6470	Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?	0
6471	Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .	0
6472	Let's look at our menus .	0
6473	Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .	0
6474	Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .	0
6475	It was nice talking to you .	0
6476	Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?	1
6477	I really have to go .	0
6478	Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .	1

6482	I'm not . I just want to know .	0
6483	Well , it's really none of your business .	0
6484	That's harsh .	1
6485	I'm sorry , but I have to go .	0
6486	Fine .	0
6487	Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?	0

6491	Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .	0
6492	And must I go back to school ?	0
6493	No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .	0
6494	But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .	0
6495	You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .	0

6498	How do you do ?	0

6514	That would be our Saver's Plus account .	0
6515	4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?	0
6516	You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .	0
6517	All right . I ’ ll open one of those .	0
6518	Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second .	0

6534	OK .	0
6535	I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?	0

6551	I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .	0
6552	I thought this was the emergency room .	0
6553	It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?	0
6554	No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .	0
6555	Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?	0
6556	My left arm .	0
6557	Can you fill out this form then ?	0
6558	No , I can't . I'm left-handed .	0
6559	That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .	0
6560	Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .	0

6578	That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?	4

6592	Quite right .	0
6593	I was wondering if you need any help on your new project .	0
6594	Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?	0
6595	I would like to help with the computer work .	0

6603	Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion .	4
6604	Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .	4
6605	I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?	0
6606	Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .	0
6607	How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?	0
6608	I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .	0

6623	Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?	0
6624	Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .	0
6625	I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .	0
6626	I am sure that document was filed .	0
6627	Well , let me check again under a different heading .	0
6628	Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .	0
6629	Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .	0
6630	What would you have ?	0
6631	I'll try Chinese wine .	0
6632	What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .	0

6644	I don ’ t know .	0
6645	How is it you don ’ t know ?	6
6646	The location of my polling place never came in the mail .	0

6659	I know that .	0
6660	Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .	0
6661	I'm not sure .	0

6688	Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .	0
6689	Thank you .	0
6690	Isn't it past your bedtime already ?	0
6691	I am not sleepy .	0
6692	It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .	0
6693	There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .	0
6694	Try listening to some soft music .	0
6695	It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .	0
6696	I really don't care , just go to sleep .	0
6697	What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?	0
6698	You'll be up all night if I let you do that .	0
6699	I'm going to get to sleep eventually .	0
6700	You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .	0
6701	Good night .	0
6702	I want to go try on these clothes .	0
6703	What did you find ?	0
6704	I found some jeans , and a new blouse .	0
6705	Go and try it on .	0
6706	What do you think ?	0
6707	I love that shirt on you .	0
6708	What about the jeans ?	0
6709	They don't really fit you right .	0
6710	I don't think so either .	0
6711	That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .	0
6712	Well , I'll just buy the shirt .	0
6713	That would be a good idea .	4
6714	Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed .	0
6715	Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .	0
6716	Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .	0
6717	Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .	0
6718	Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?	0
6719	Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .	0
6720	Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .	0
6721	Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .	0
6722	I see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?	0
6723	Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?	0
6724	We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .	0
6725	What ’ s the result ?	0
6726	We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .	0
6727	That seems very impressive . Good work !	4
6728	Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .	4
6729	Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .	0
6730	I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .	5
6731	What seems to be the trouble now ?	0
6732	I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .	0
6733	Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .	0
6734	Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .	5
6735	And what about dinner ?	0
6736	Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .	0
6737	That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?	0
6738	I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .	0
6739	Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .	4
6740	No , thank you .	4

6747	We can have it to you at that time .	0
6748	That's not a problem ?	0
6749	We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .	0
6750	That's great ! Thank you very much .	4
6751	Can I help you ?	0
6752	Yes , I'm looking for a house .	0
6753	To buy or to rent ?	0
6754	Oh , to rent .	0
6755	How much do you want to pay ?	0

6758	How big is it ?	0
6759	It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .	0

6777	What are you reading ?	0
6778	Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .	0
6779	I thought he usually wrote horror books .	6
6780	He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .	0
6781	We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?	0
6782	Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .	0
6783	Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .	0
6784	I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .	0
6785	This is sure to be a worthwhile read .	0
6786	Doctor , I have the worst toothache !	5

6809	What do you want to do ?	0
6810	I want to get a puppy for my son .	0
6811	That will make him so happy .	0
6812	I'll get him one of those little dogs .	0
6813	One that won't grow up too big .	0
6814	And eat too much .	0
6815	Do you know which one he would like ?	0
6816	Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .	0
6817	I bet you had to drag him away .	0
6818	He wanted to take it home yesterday .	0
6819	I wonder what he'll name it .	0
6820	Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport .	0
6821	OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?	0
6822	Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .	0
6823	Is there anything else ?	0
6824	There are a mouse and a camera .	0
6825	Is that all ?	0
6826	Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?	0
6827	It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .	0
6828	I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?	0
6829	Please go over there to weigh them .	0
6830	OK . See you later .	0
6831	what happened ? Why didn't he win ?	6
6832	didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .	0
6833	how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	6
6834	if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	0
6835	what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	6
6836	he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	0
6837	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	0
6838	they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	0
6839	that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	0
6840	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	0
6841	regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	0
6842	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	0
6843	let's hope so .	0
6844	I need to use the ATM .	0
6845	What ’ s stopping you ?	0
6846	I ’ m not sure how .	0
6847	I don ’ t understand .	0

6852	Then what ?	0
6853	You need to type your PIN in .	0
6854	What do I have to do next ?	0
6855	Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done .	0
6856	"What are you doing ? Checking the "" to do "" list for the wedding ?"	0
6857	Yep . There's still so much to do !	0
6858	So let's start by checking off what we've already done .	0
6859	Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?	0
6860	Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .	0
6861	Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !	4
6862	Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !	0
6863	It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .	0
6864	We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?	4
6865	Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .	0
6866	You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?	4
6867	Sounds good . May I have a look ?	4
6868	Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .	4
6869	They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .	0
6870	All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .	4
6871	Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?	0
6872	This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .	0
6873	Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .	0
6874	OK , I will wrap them for you .	4
6875	Can you make out what he's saying ?	0
6876	No , it's too loud in here .	0
6877	Excuse me .	0
6878	Yes ?	0
6879	Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?	0
6880	Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...	4
6881	Along Queen's Road ...	0
6882	Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .	0
6883	Right at the Hilton .	0
6884	Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .	0
6885	The Cathedral ?	0
6886	Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .	0
6887	That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?	4
6888	Yes . Why ?	0
6889	Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .	0
6890	Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?	0
6891	I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .	0
6892	Where to ?	0
6893	How about Karlis ?	0
6894	Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .	6
6895	True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?	0
6896	Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .	0
6897	I guess it is a little pricy .	0
6898	Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..	0
6899	That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .	0
6900	That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .	0
6901	Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?	0
6902	You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .	0
6903	Good morning , sir .	0
6904	Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .	0
6905	Do you have a particular style in mind ?	0
6906	The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .	0
6907	I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .	0
6908	I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .	0
6909	The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?	0
6910	Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?	4
6911	Next Friday .	0
6912	Thank you .	4
6913	Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .	5
6914	Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .	0
6915	Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .	0
6916	Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .	0
6917	I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .	0
6918	Good luck to us .	0
6919	Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !	0
6920	Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .	0
6921	I have never been to the personnel market .	0
6922	Really ? I have been there several times .	6
6923	Are there many employers ?	0
6924	Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .	0
6925	So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?	0
6926	Yes , there are many famous corporations .	0
6927	When will there be a job fair ?	0
6928	Every Saturday and Sunday	0
6929	Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?	0
6930	No , it's free .	0
6931	How about going there to have a look now ?	0
6932	OK , let's go .	0
6933	Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?	0
6934	Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .	0
6935	What's the price ?	0
6936	$ 12 .	0
6937	Can you make it any cheaper ?	0
6938	It is cheap .	0
6939	I'll take it if you give me a discount .	0
6940	$ 10 . That's the best I can do .	0
6941	OK . I'll take the blue one .	4

6943	Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .	0
6944	Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?	0
6945	We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .	0
6946	That's not a problem .	0
6947	Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .	0
6948	Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .	4
6949	I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .	0
6950	We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .	0
6951	I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .	0
6952	We need to find a good realtor .	0
6953	Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .	0
6954	What do you mean ?	0
6955	Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .	0
6956	But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .	0
6957	Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .	0
6958	I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has	0
6959	Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .	0
6960	So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?	0
6961	It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .	0
6962	And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?	0
6963	Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .	0
6964	Why ?	6
6965	Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .	0
6966	Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .	0
6967	It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .	0
6968	I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .	0
6969	Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .	0
6970	I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .	0
6971	Sorry to hear that .	0

6973	Fine , we'll be expecting you then .	0
6974	Which restaurant do you prefer ?	0
6975	I'd like to taste Mexican food .	0
6976	How about the one on Baker Street ?	0
6977	Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .	4
6978	The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .	0
6979	I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .	0
6980	Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .	0
6981	You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?	0
6982	I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .	0

6986	Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind .	4
6987	Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?	0
6988	Sure , but I have to finish this report first .	0
6989	Never mind . I'll do it .	0
6990	Are you interested in mountaineering ?	0
6991	Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you	0
6992	I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .	0
6993	How did you spend the night there ?	0
6994	We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .	0
6995	I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .	0
6996	Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?	0
6997	Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .	0
6998	I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?	0
6999	I'd love to .	4

7005	Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )	0

7032	I see.Has she read any detective stories ?	0
7033	Oh , yes !	0

7040	Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?	0
7041	Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .	0
7042	Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .	0
7043	I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !	0
7044	Really ? What's the series about ?	0
7045	Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .	0
7046	It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .	0
7047	I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .	0
7048	Really ? that's interesting !	4
7049	Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .	4
7050	OK , I'll give it a go .	4

7076	Any cigarettes or liquor ?	0
7077	I have cigarettes for my own use .	0
7078	I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .	0
7079	How much duty should I pay ?	0
7080	One hundred dollars .	0
7081	Here is the money .	0

7083	Thank you .	0
7084	So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...	0
7085	We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...	0
7086	That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .	0
7087	Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?	0
7088	Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?	0
7089	Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .	0
7090	Yes .	0
7091	I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .	0
7092	A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .	0
7093	I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .	0
7094	Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?	0
7095	Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !	0
7096	Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?	0
7097	Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !	0

7121	What's so interesting about it ?	0
7122	Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !	6
7123	What ? How did that happen ?	0
7124	They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .	0
7125	Wow . What does his look like now ?	0
7126	It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .	0

7623	That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .	0
7624	Well , thanks a lot for your help .	4
7625	No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .	0
7626	OK , goodbye .	0
7627	Goodbye , sir .	0
7628	I need some flowers for my girlfriend .	0
7629	No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?	0
7630	Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .	0

7633	Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .	0
7634	I will take ten .	0

7641	Do you have a registration card ?	0

7648	Hey there Chris , what are you up to ?	0
7649	I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .	0
7650	Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?	0
7651	Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .	0
7652	So this would be your first automobile ?	0
7653	That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .	0
7654	Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .	0
7655	Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .	0
7656	So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !	4
7657	Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .	0
7658	Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .	0
7659	I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .	0
7660	Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?	0
7661	Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .	0
7662	I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .	0
7663	Can I help you ?	0
7664	I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .	0
7665	Is it a photograph or a document ?	0
7666	Each of both .	0
7667	Could I see both of them ?	0
7668	Here you are .	0
7669	You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .	0
7670	Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?	0
7671	Couple of minutes .	0
7672	Great . How much ?	0
7673	5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .	0
7674	Thank you . I will deal with it .	4

7682	No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?	0
7683	Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?	0
7684	It says ' Keep off the grass ! '	0
7685	Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .	0
7686	Be careful . You can't smoke here .	0
7687	Why not ?	0
7688	Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .	0
7689	I'd like a double room .	0

7693	Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .	0
7694	Would you sign the register , PLS ?	0
7695	By the way , does my room have a private bath ?	0
