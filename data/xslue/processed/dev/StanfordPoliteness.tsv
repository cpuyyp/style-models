223328	Re your vote on motion 1, I don't currently have a mafia, to the best of my knowledge&mdash;but maybe it's not a bad idea. Shall I post a sign-up sheet?	0.6293674803257416
286300	How come you removed Dobby as an omitted character? Where does he appear?	0.5044336364789589
629394	In the Catalan Wikipedia we have more than 60 wrong pages that we want to delete but nobody can do it. Where I have to request the permition?	0.5701284181270786
622385	I have made changes to <url>. Is that acceptable?	0.6618857780605496
427348	Hi, yes I love your stats tool too. But could it also cover wikiversity and perhaps the other sister projects?	0.625517823857191
153157	Hi, I was just going to query your recent removal of the <url> article, without merging any of the article's content into <url>'s article. Was there any particular reason for the loss of content?	0.6325343367034225
332347	In <url>, people seemed to agree with you, but I just don't understand your proposal. So, what exactly do you mean in terms of category renaming/merging/recategorization?	0.5392873506113519
605170	Excuse me, but <url> seems to have slept through its normal editing period last night. Is it still working?	0.5887979084501581
445280	I'll do so then. What's the procedure?	0.597936901918645
37554	Why did you remove the pollution references on <url>. Do you have a source which refutes this claim?	0.5232160688699165
237529	Do you mind if you tell me why do you add duplicate links to the article? More specifically, why do you add internal links to the See Also sections when those links are already in the article navbox?	0.5017355108944186
629713	Notability is an issue of common sense: you're writing for other people, so what is notable for you (or me) is not that relevant. My local shop is more important and notable ''to me'' than Wal-mart, but who, other than me, actually cares?	0.4313777763824423
476067	It's just, what becomes of <url>? Is the mention really there or not?	0.5343379245842048

159812	As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?	0.7255125505909373
627097	So what kind of redirects ''would'' be appropriate in a print encyclopedia?  The way you describe it, this would seem to be the default setting for all redirects, wouldn't it?	0.6062131757094799
608589	Is this really notable?  Time for an AfD nom?	0.4638212024821034
137459	Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>. Wouldn't <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago?	0.4920866784033836
472273	"Redirecting is blanking would be more accurate. Or maybe ""redirecting is redirecting""?"	0.5758990333091947

461087	I'm really very sorry, but no, I '''didn't''' know, didn't get a message saying that was wrong. Where was it?	0.7118796081191957
349739	"It is the choice of template name as ""Shinto2"" which seems IMHO poor for use within an article (i.e. the ""2"" bit), hence suggestion of <nowiki><url></nowiki> (distinct from <nowiki><url></nowiki> currently used for various talk page headers), or if you don't like that as a name then perhaps <nowiki><url></nowiki> (invoked as <person>) ?"	0.55519817280988
39167	Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I'm at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help?	0.5843473975218773
110607	"Thank you for removing the ""Speedy Deletion"" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable?"	0.7609867920013136
93120	"This is a really sore subject, because most of parents of kids with learning difficulties dont agree with the term ""retardation"" - it is unscientific and also quite abusive. Could you please delete the category or rename it ""learning disability organisations ?"	0.6543204234031458
359566	Does it not take just a bit more than someone saying they own it to remove a copyvio? As can be seen I post from Canada and what's to stop me claiming to be <url> and anything published in the <url> can be put on Wikipedia (or something a little more sensible)?	0.3906319064211914

168161	As an outsider, I thought that the thrust of Floydian's edit was good, but it was a little terse in its wording (I've been guilty of such overly terse writing myself). Rather than reverting with such an insulting edit, perhaps Coolcaeser could simply copyedit Floydian's text?	0.6479409235135735
627881	"I have never seen anything which says that warning levels should begin anew each day. <url> says that warning templates ""are listed at right in order of severity, but need not be used in succession."" If there is another policy somewhere, could you show it to me?"	0.7171739330720264
