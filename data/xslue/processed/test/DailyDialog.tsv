16	We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .	0
17	That's excellent . How have you managed that ?	0
18	Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .	0

20	Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .	0
21	What other sources of energy do you use ?	0

256	what would you do without me ?	0
257	This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability .	0
258	Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 .

279	Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .	0
280	Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?	0

292	I got fired .	5
293	How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?	6
294	It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .	5
295	What are you going to do now ?	0
296	I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .	0

298	Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .	0
299	Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .	0

307	I needed to get something really quick .	0
308	Where did you park at ?	0
309	At my apartment building .	0
310	Don't you have your own parking spot ?	0
311	I needed to be fast .	0
312	That was very lazy of you .	0
313	How may I help you ?	0
314	I ’ m having a problem .	0
315	What problem are you having ?	0
316	There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ’ t make .	0
317	Do you have the statement for your card ?	0
318	Here it is .	0
319	What are the charges you ’ re referring to ?	0
320	The last four charges on the page .	0
321	I ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges .	0
322	How long will an investigation take ?	0
323	I honestly don ’ t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .	0
324	That sounds absolutely fantastic .	4
325	Good afternoon . Can I be of service ?	0

328	Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .	0
329	OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ?	0
330	Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?	0
331	No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them .	0
332	Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !	1
333	I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !	1
334	Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker .	1
335	Banker ?	0
336	Yes ...	0
337	Can I have my $ 200 please ?	0
338	Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice .	4
339	Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ?	0
340	This is Professor Clark speaking .	0
341	Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class .	0
342	Yes , what can I do for you ?	0

350	Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !	0
351	I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .	0
352	Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .	0
353	Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .	0
354	That would be great ! Is it expensive ?	4
355	Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .	0
356	Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .	0
357	I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?	4
358	My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .	0
359	I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?	5
360	Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .	0
361	You need a babysitter .	0
362	Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .	0
363	I could have Suzy stay at my place .	0
364	I don't want to do that to you , Karen .	0
365	Why not ?	0
366	Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .	0
367	I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .	0
368	I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .	0
369	I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .	0
370	I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .	4
371	I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .	0
372	Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .	4
373	Good evening . What'll you have ?	0
374	I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ?	0
375	Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?	0
376	A draft beer please .	0
377	OK . Here you are .	0
378	Could I have some fruit ?	0
379	Of course . Wait for a moment , please .	4
380	Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?	0
381	Fine , thank you , and how are you ?	0
382	Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .	4
383	Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .	4
384	How are you getting along with your business ?	0
385	Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .	0
386	I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .	0
387	By the way miss , where is the toilet ?	0
388	Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .	5
389	What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .	6
390	You are welcome .	4
391	excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?	0
392	you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .	0
393	that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?	0
394	it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .	0
395	can I buy stamps here ?	0
396	sure . How many would you like ?	0
397	I need 30 for my Christmas cards .	0
398	are you sending them abroad ?	0
399	twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .	0
400	do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .	0
401	no .	0
402	ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .	0
403	and the bubble wrap ?	0
404	that ’ s another quid .	0
405	thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful .	4
406	Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?	4
407	I am cooking now !	0
408	Are you good at cooking ?	0
409	I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !	0
410	It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !	0
411	I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?	0
412	Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .	0
413	That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .	0
414	I have the same idea as yours .	0
415	It's OK . Please have a taste of it .	0
416	Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .	4
417	Thank you for your praise .	4
418	Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?	0
419	I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .	0
420	So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?	0
421	Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .	0
422	Thanks a lot .	4
423	It's my pleasure .	4
424	Room service.What can I do for you ?	0
425	This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .	1
426	Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?	0
427	Yes , I ordered the express service .	0
428	Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?	0
429	That's fine .	0
430	I'd like you to do me a favor .	0
431	What is it ?	0
432	Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .	0
433	Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .	4
434	Excuse me , may I help you ?	0
435	Would you please fill some gas for me ?	0
436	Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?	0
437	Unleaded , please .	0
438	OK .	0
439	I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .	0
440	It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .	0
441	What about a draft at 120 days sight ?	0
442	All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .	0
443	A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .	0
444	Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .	0
445	I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .	0
446	So do I .	0
447	There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?	0
448	I haven't seen her yet .	0

451	She's kind of short .	0
452	What height is she ?	0
453	She's probably about five feet .	0
454	That's nice , but tell me what she looks like .	0
455	The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .	0
456	I think I might've bumped into her before .	0

458	I believe so .	0
459	Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?	0
460	Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .	0

475	Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .	0
476	Sound great . Let's go !	4

478	True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .	0
479	You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .	0
480	You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven .	0
481	Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .	0
482	Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .	0
483	OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant	0
484	Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?	0
485	Where do you want to go ?	0
486	I'm going to the hospital .	0
487	Get in . I'll take you .	0
488	About how much will it cost ?	0
489	It will cost you $ 10 .	0
490	By the way , what's the time ?	0
491	You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .	0
492	It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?	0
493	Certainly .	0
494	You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .	0
495	Where was it from ?	0
496	It was made in Jingdezhen .	0
497	Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?	0
498	You are right .	0
499	This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .	4
500	It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .	0
501	It must be most precious .	4
502	But it is really worth the price .	0
503	Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?	0

511	Thanks .	4
512	you are welcome .	4
513	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?	0
514	Alright .	0
515	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .	3
516	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .	0
517	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .	1
518	Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .	0
519	It really hurts .	0
520	Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?	0
521	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .	1
522	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?	0
523	To hell with you .	1

527	It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?	0
528	Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .	0
529	What about the performance itself ?	0
530	Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .	0
531	Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .	0
532	It surely is . And the cast is really the best .	0
533	Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?	4
534	The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .	0
535	All right . I want to bring everybody back on this subject . When can we start working on this ?	0
536	Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .	0
537	I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00	0
538	That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?	0
539	Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .	0
540	What dressing would you like on the salad ?	0
541	French dressing , please .	0
542	I beg your pardon ?	0
543	Oh , French dressing .	0
544	Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?	0
545	We still prefer French dressing .	0
546	Could I have some fish ?	0
547	Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ?	4
548	Oh , spinach , I think .	0
549	Fine , And what about something to drink ?	0
550	Just a beer , please .	0
551	Good . Thank you.sir .	4
552	Would you like to have some more beer ?	0
553	No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please .	4
554	Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .	0
555	Thank you .	4
556	Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?	0
557	Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .	0
558	Yeah , that's very important .	0
559	So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .	0
560	I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .	0
561	That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .	0
562	It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .	0
563	It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .	0
564	But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .	0
565	I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .	0
566	It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .	0
567	You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .	0
568	I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .	0
569	You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .	0
570	It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .	0
571	It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .	0
572	The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?	0
573	No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .	0
574	It better be more than last year .	0
575	Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .	0
576	I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed .	0
577	What a pity !	0
578	If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?	0
579	That's OK .	0
580	Good day ! Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how may we assist you ?	0
581	Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .	0
582	Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?	0
583	It's NX567822100007 .	0
584	Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .	0
585	OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?	0
586	No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .	0
587	May I help you ?	0
588	Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?	0
589	Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?	0
590	I would prefer the first one .	0
591	Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .	0
592	Hello , Sir . How can we help you today ?	0
593	I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .	0
594	OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .	0
595	OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?	0
596	Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .	0
597	That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !	4
598	911 emergency . What is the problem ?	0
599	I would like to report a break-in .	0

603	It happened at my house .	0

609	I'd appreciate that .	0
610	Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ?	0
611	One dollar .	0
612	So , I can have five for five dollars ?	0
613	Actually , you can only have four .	0
614	Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please .	0
615	Okay . Thanks .	0
616	House keeping.May I come in ?	0
617	Come in please .	0
618	Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?	0
619	Well , since you have come , do it now please ?	0
620	That's all . Have a nice stay here .	0
621	Thank you.Please get some soap for us .	0
622	Just a moment . I will do it right now .	0
623	Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem .	0

625	My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late .	0
626	Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ?	0
627	Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?	0
628	Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks .	0
629	I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?	0
630	According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .	0
631	Then tell me something about your background .	0
632	My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .	0
633	Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?	0
634	The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .	0
635	Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?	0
636	Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .	0
637	Have you got anything to ask me ?	0
638	Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?	0
639	Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .	0
640	I see . This is my advantage .	0
641	Good . Have you got any other questions ?	0
642	No .	0

648	She kept bothering me .	0

651	Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ?	0

653	That is a wonderful idea .	4

656	No problem . Good luck	4
657	Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ?	4
658	The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?	0
659	Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?	0
660	They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .	0
661	Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !	6
662	Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .	0

672	it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go .	0
673	but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !	6
674	well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .	0
675	well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?	4
676	the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .	0
677	it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .	0
678	I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .	0

930	I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .	0
931	Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?	0
932	I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .	0
933	Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?	0
934	I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .	0
935	What is your greatest strength ?	0
936	I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .	0
937	What is your greatest weakness ?	0
938	I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .	0

947	And what is the most important point ?	0
948	You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .	0
949	Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour .	0
950	Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .	0
951	We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .	0
952	That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously .	0

959	The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .	0

961	How many dogs live in this house ?	0
962	I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house .	0
963	Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .	0
964	Have you decided what wine you would like ?	0

966	I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .	0
967	That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .	0

1070	This is the place I was telling you about .	0
1071	Would you like to sit near the window ?	0
1072	Good .	4
1073	Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?	0

1094	I can't figure out how to turn them on .	0
1095	Do you have some quarters ?	0

1097	The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .	0
1098	Where do I put the change ?	0
1099	The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .	0

1105	Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ?	0
1106	Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation	0
1107	Only three days ?	6

1110	Yes . That's the company policy .	0
1111	It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different .	5
1112	I am absolutely famished .	0
1113	Yeah . I am too .	0
1114	Where did you want to go for lunch ?	0
1115	I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .	0
1116	I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .	0
1117	I actually like the food there .	4
1118	Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?	0
1119	They have anything you want .	0
1120	I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .	0
1121	I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .	4
1122	We can eat at the cafeteria .	0
1123	I think you'll really like the food there .	4
1124	Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .	0
1125	That's OK .	0
1126	The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .	0
1127	Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .	0
1128	Thank you .	0
1129	Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .	0
1130	That's a good idea .	0
1131	First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .	0
1132	Agreed .	0
1133	For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .	0
1134	I understand your position .	0
1135	I want to buy a black suit .	0
1136	Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?	0
1137	I prefer single breasted suit .	0
1138	What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .	0
1139	That looks great . Do you have ties here ?	0
1140	How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .	4
1141	How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you .	4
1142	Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .	0
1143	Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price .	0
1144	I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .	0
1145	That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .	0
1146	That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .	0
1147	I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?	0
1148	Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?	0
1149	All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .	0
1150	Very well . Thank you .	0
1151	Don't I know you ?	0
1152	I'm not sure.You look familiar .	0
1153	You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?	0
1154	Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember .	0
1155	That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company .	0
1156	Yes , I have an overall understanding .	0
1157	When we have the final results , we will call you .	0
1158	Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?	0
1159	If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .	0
1160	But if I don't pass , will you call me ?	0
1161	I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .	0
1162	Then do I have the chance to get this job ?	0
1163	I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .	0
1164	I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .	0
1165	Your mentality is very good and that's great .	4
1166	Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .	4
1167	My pleasure .	4

1174	I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .	0
1175	What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?	0
1176	I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .	0
1177	What kind of people do you like to work with ?	0
1178	People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .	0
1179	I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .	4
1180	Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .	0

Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations .	0
1190	What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?	0
1191	Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .	0
1192	I think Yoga might be suitable for me .	0
1193	Why ?	0
1194	Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .	0
1195	But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .	0
1196	I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .	0
1197	You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .	0
1198	We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?	0

1202	Are these the clothes you want to have washed ?	0
1203	Yes . When can I get them back ?	0
1204	Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .	0
1205	That's fine . By the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .	0
1206	OK . Please fill in the form first .	0
1207	What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days .	0
1208	Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .	0
1209	And what's the cause of that ?	0
1210	Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .	0
1211	But I can't just slow down .	0
1212	You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .	0
1213	You mean I've got to lose weight ?	0
1214	Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .	0
1215	You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ?	0
1216	Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .	0
1217	So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?	0
1218	Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .	0
1219	Do you do the same exercises every day ?	0
1220	No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .	0
1221	Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?	0
1222	It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .	0
1223	Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .	0
1224	I want some cosmetics.Could you recommend some ?	0
1225	I think Pond's is the best .	4
1226	And they're very dear , too .	4
1227	They're on special offer today .	0
1228	Oh , that's ideal .	4
1229	Steven , I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow . Can you give me some advice ? And what should I pay attention to ?	0

1231	I will go to bed early tonight .	0
1232	Do you have an airsickness ?	0
1233	I don't know . But I have a carsickness .	0
1234	You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .	0
1235	Thank you .	0
1236	Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?	0
1237	Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?	0
1238	Either way is good for me .	4
1239	There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?	0
1240	I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .	0
1241	We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .	0
1242	I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .	0
1243	I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .	0
1244	I would like to see as many as possible .	0
1245	When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .	0
1246	Do you have a package tour to Hollywood ?	0
1247	Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?	0

1250	We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?	0
1251	Here you are .	0
1252	What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong .	1
1253	What do you mean ?	0
1254	Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way .	1
1255	Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ...	0
1256	Enough is enough . I know .	0
1257	Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ?	0
1258	I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office .	0

1315	No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony .	0

1327	That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you .	0
1328	Is it anything like American football ?	0
1329	Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .	0
1330	I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .	0
1331	Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .	4

1333	Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .	0
1334	Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?	0

1336	I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .	0
1337	Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .	0

1349	Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .	5
1350	You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so	0
1351	Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have	0

1484	Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .	4
1485	Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work .	0
1486	That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .	0
1487	I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .	0
1488	All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it .	0

1518	Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .	4
1519	I think you make the right decision .	0
1520	Have you any round-neck sweater ?	0
1521	Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .	0
1522	Can I try this one on ?	0
1523	Sure , go ahead .	0
1524	The color is too bright.For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .	0
1525	So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?	4
1526	Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff .	2
1527	Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .	0
1528	What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .	1
1529	Not for me , Dick .	0

1536	Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?	1
1537	Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .	0
1538	This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !	1
1539	If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .	0
1540	Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .	0

1574	It better be more than last year .	0
1575	Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .	0
1576	I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit .	0
1577	Why , do we need groceries ?	0
1578	I believe we are all out of food .	0
1579	Do you know what to get ?	0
1580	I don't know what we need .	0
1581	Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?	0
1582	I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .	0
1583	Why don't you just get the basics ?	0
1584	What do you mean ?	0

1597	Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ?	0
1598	I was unable to make it .	0
1599	You should have been there . It was intense .	0
1600	Is that right . Who ended up winning ?	0
1601	Our team was victorious .	0
1602	I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .	0
1603	It was a great game .	0
1604	What was the score at the end of the game ?	0
1605	Our team won 101-98 .	0

1609	Have you ever tried shopping online ?	0
1610	No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .	0
1611	That's right . Seeing is believing .	0
1612	I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .	0
1613	That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .	0
1614	What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .	0
1615	It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .	0
1616	I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .	0
1617	Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .	0
1618	That's a good idea .	4

1626	Yes , at the end of the hall .	0
1627	Good morning , sir . May I help you ?	0
1628	Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00	0

1644	I'm not sure yet .	0
1645	What makes you think there was a break-in ?	0
1646	My front window was busted .	0
1647	I'll send a squad car .	0
1648	Please hurry .	0
1649	Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...	0
1650	You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .	0
1651	Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .	0
1652	OK , OK !	0
1653	Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?	0
1654	Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .	0
1655	Well , that's kind of obvious .	0
1656	Give me a break , Mr Yang .	1
1657	Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?	0
1658	I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault .	0
1659	What do you mean ?	0
1660	It looks like the shipping company did this .	0
1661	We'd better take it up with them , in that case .	0
1662	I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !	0
1663	No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .	0
1664	Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .	0
1665	Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?	0
1666	Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .	0
1667	Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production	0
1668	That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !	0
1669	Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...	4
1670	Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .	0
1671	Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?	4
1672	I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .	0
1673	Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?	0
1674	It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .	0
1675	Ah , get back to you .	2
1676	Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?	0
1677	Do you need a guide ?	0
1678	Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?	0
1679	It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .	0
1680	That's reasonable .	0
1681	Aren't you Jim Green ?	0
1682	Yes , that's right .	0

1686	Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .	0
1687	I think I can handle it by myself .	0
1688	I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .	0
1689	I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .	0
1690	Other company rules also need your attention .	0
1691	Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me .	0

1731	Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .	0
1732	Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .	4
1733	Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .	0

1757	What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !	4
1758	It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .	0
1759	You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .	0
1760	The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .	0
1761	Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?	0
1762	It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .	0
1763	It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .	0
1764	Billy , you are late again .	0

1768	Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .	0
1769	You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?	0
1770	I think he might . You'd better go to his office .	0
1771	You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .	0

1905	Yes , good luck , Maria .	0

1919	really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?	4
1920	she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .	4
1921	wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?	4
1922	it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .	0
1923	are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?	0
1924	yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !	0

1938	that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?	0
1939	no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .	0
1940	how much does the magadize cost ?	0
1941	it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .	0
1942	that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?	0
1943	Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .	0
1944	I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !	0
1945	Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !	4
1946	Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .	0
1947	But you could have saved money .	0

1999	Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract .	4

2383	So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...	0
2384	No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .	0
2385	How many people are on the board of directors ?	0
2386	Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .	0
2387	How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ?	0
2388	We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?	0
2389	Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?	0
2390	No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .	0
2391	Mum , can I finish my homework later ?	0
2392	Sorry . You know the rules .	0
2393	But I want to watch TV now .	0
2394	That ’ s out of the question .	0
2395	Please .	0
2396	Not a chance .	0
2397	Not even for an hour ?	0
2398	Sorry , it ’ s impossible .	0
2399	Where ’ s Sally , Jack ?	0
2400	She ’ s in the garden , Jane .	0

2403	Is Tim in the garden , too ?	0

2442	I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .	0
2443	What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?	6
2444	Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .	0
2445	We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .	0
2446	OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .	0
2447	You get your bus pass ?	0
2448	I'm not going to buy one .	0
2449	You're not ?	0
2450	I think it's a waste of money .	0
2451	It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .	0
2452	How is that ?	0
2453	You can use it however many times you need to .	0
2454	Is that right ?	0
2455	Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .	0
2456	That sounds nice .	4
2457	You should go get yours .	0

2485	I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .	0
2486	You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .	0
2487	So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .	0
2488	Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .	0
2489	Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?	0
2490	Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .	0
2491	How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?	0
2492	Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .	0

2501	One last question	0
2502	"Oh , no . Everything we sell here is "" as is . """	0
2503	I guess I was asking for too much .	0
2504	If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .	0
2505	We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !	1
2506	Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !	0
2507	Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?	0
2508	I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !	0
2509	What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	0
2510	Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?	0
2511	We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	0
2512	Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !	0

2523	You can't be serious !	1
2524	Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .	1
2525	After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .	1
2526	Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .	1
2527	You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !	1
2528	Whatever you say !	1

2530	Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?	0
2531	I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .	0
2532	If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?	0
2533	Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .	0

2535	I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .	1

2539	I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .	0
2540	What ? He can't do this to you .	6
2541	Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .	1
2542	What did you do ?	0
2543	I shouted it back of course .	1
2544	Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?	0
2545	What would you do if you were in my shoes ?	0
2546	Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .	0
2547	No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .	1
2548	I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .	0

2560	I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .	0

2819	Why are you acting so strange today ?	0
2820	I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .	1
2821	That's weird !	6
2822	Now please tell me something about your past work achievements .	0
2823	All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .	0
2824	That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?	0
2825	I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .	0

2836	Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get to City Hall ?	0
2837	Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .	0
2838	I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?	0
2839	Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .	0
2840	Uh-huh .	0

2854	Yeah , maybe next time .	0
2855	I'll hold you to that .	0
2856	Sounds like a plan .	0
2857	I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ?	0
2858	It's simple . You can use call transfer .	0
2859	Is it so simple ?	0
2860	Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .	0
2861	It's true .	0
2862	Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .	0
2863	That's all ?	0
2864	In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .	0
2865	Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project .	0
2866	Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?	0

2874	You still have time on your lease .	0
2875	There ’ s no way that I can stay here .	1
2876	That ’ s not going to be all right .	0
2877	I don ’ t understand why .	6
2878	I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit	0
2879	Why can ’ t I have it back ?	0
2880	Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .	0
2881	You have to give it back to me .	0
2882	You ’ re not going to get it .	0
2883	But I ’ m not able to live here anymore .	1

2894	Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .	0
2895	You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?	0

2900	That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?	0
2901	No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .	0
2902	Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?	0

2941	Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?	4
2942	Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .	0
2943	Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .	0
2944	That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .	0
2945	OK . Anything else ?	0

2984	Do you want some dessert ?	0
2985	No , thank you . Check , please .	0
2986	Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .	0
2987	Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .	0
2988	Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .	0
2989	How to do it ?	0
2990	Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .	0
2991	How long will it take to reach the buffet ?	0
2992	Not long , because people rush for lunch .	0

3000	Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today .	0
3001	Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .	0
3002	Yeah , so are you planning on going ?	0
3003	I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .	0
3004	It really does , I can't wait .	0
3005	What time does the party start ?	0
3006	It starts at 8 o'clock .	0
3007	Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?	0
3008	I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .	0
3009	Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .	0
3010	After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ?	0
3011	The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .	0
3012	As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort .	0
3013	Great . Welcome to our company .	0
3014	Farmer's Pet Store .	0
3015	Can you please tell me where you are located ?	0
3016	Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .	0
3017	Thank you , I know where that is .	4
3018	Hi , Bob , this is John Lin .	0
3019	Hello , John .	0
3020	I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .	0
3021	How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?	0
3022	Hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ?	0
3023	Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .	2
3024	What ' the matter ?	0
3025	The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .	2
3026	I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .	0
3027	Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .	0
3028	That's true .	0
3029	Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?	0
3030	It was good . I brought lunch from home today .	4
3031	You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .	6
3032	Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .	0
3033	I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .	0
3034	Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?	0
3035	You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .	0
3036	Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .	0
3037	Seriously ?	6
3038	Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .	0
3039	Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online .	0
3040	Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?	4
3041	Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .	0
3042	I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !	4
3043	Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .	4
3044	Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !	4
3045	Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .	4
3046	Good idea !	4
3047	Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room .	0
3048	That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?	0
3049	My name is John Sandals .	0
3050	Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?	0

3056	Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?	0
3057	Nonsmoking , please .	0
3058	Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?	0

3063	Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ?	0

3065	We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?	0
3066	Sure , that sounds good .	4
3067	Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?	4
3068	No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .	0
3069	Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !	0
3070	Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..	4

3072	Hello , Personal Banking . How may I help you ?	0
3073	Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ?	0
3074	Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ...	0
3075	That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .	0
3076	I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce .	0
3077	It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !	0
3078	Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?	0
3079	Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .	0
3080	Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ?	0
3081	Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?	0
3082	Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .	0
3083	That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?	4
3084	It says it's located in the suburbs .	0
3085	What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ?	0
3086	Chicken , please .	0
3087	Good choice !	0
3088	What kind of drinks do you have ?	0
3089	Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .	0
3090	In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .	0
3091	Anything else ?	0
3092	I would like to have some tea as well .	0
3093	Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .	0
3094	I see .	0
3095	I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ?	0
3096	I'd be glad to .	0
3097	I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .	0
3098	Do you have an account with this bank ?	0
3099	I'm afraid not .	0
3100	In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .	0
3101	What is the interest rate on your card ?	0
3102	The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .	0
3103	That's very expensive !	0
3104	Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .	0
3105	How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?	0
3106	You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .	0
3107	Does the card provide any other benefits ?	0
3108	You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .	0
3109	You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ?	0
3110	Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour .	0
3111	You're kidding !	4
3112	No . And then I often go Rollerblading .	0
3113	Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?	0
3114	About five times a week . What about you ?	0
3115	Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato !	0
3116	I don't believe we've met .	0
3117	No , I don't think we have .	0
3118	My name is Gao Run .	0
3119	How do you do ? My name is James Green .	0
3120	Here's my name card .	0
3121	And here's mine .	0
3122	It's nice to finally meet you .	4
3123	And I'm glad to meet you , too .	4
3124	Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ?	0
3125	Mr . Smith , please .	0
3126	Sorry , he is out .	0
3127	What time do you expect him back then ?	0
3128	Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ?	0
3129	No , thanks . I will call back later .	0

3135	Three thousand US dollars .	0
3136	All right , can I have your passbook ?	0

3139	It's all the same to me .	0
3140	Here you are .	0
3141	Thanks .	0
3142	The plumbing in my new apartment is not working .	0
3143	I need you to tell me what the problem is .	0
3144	The bathroom sink is stopped up .	0
3145	Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?	0
3146	Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .	0
3147	Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?	0
3148	Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .	0
3149	Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?	0
3150	I am not sure if I will be home later .	0
3151	I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key .	0
3152	Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !	4
3153	It's more violent than TV news !	4
3154	What time is it anyway ?	0
3155	Nine-thirty .	0
3156	Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !	4
3157	No time . That's their headlights in the window !	0
3158	OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...	0
3159	Little dude , your life is over !	0
3160	No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .	0
3161	How old is Keith ?	0
3162	He's 21 . How old is James ?	0
3163	He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .	0
3164	How's your father ?	0
3165	He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .	0
3166	He can spend more time with his grandchildren .	0
3167	Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .	0
3168	So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !	4
3169	How do you want to spend your old age ?	0
3170	In the same way , probably .	0
3171	Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?	0
3172	Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .	0
3173	But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?	0
3174	Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .	0
3175	It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?	0
3176	Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .	0
3177	Why not come over to work in my company ?	0
3178	I need to think it over .	0
3179	Tell me what you need .	0
3180	All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .	0
3181	We are approaching the top of the mountain .	0
3182	What a beautiful view we have here .	4
3183	Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .	0
3184	Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?	4
3185	Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .	0
3186	what did you do last night ?	0
3187	I just stayed at home and watched TV .	0
3188	did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?	0
3189	yes , it was a very evenly matched game .	0
3190	what were the results of the game ?	0
3191	it ended in a tie .	0
3192	what was the actual score ?	0
3193	it was three all .	0
3194	really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .	0
3195	if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .	0
3196	what happened ?	0
3197	their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .	0
3198	that explains it .	0
3199	how many more games are left this season ?	0
3200	that was the last game before the playoffs .	0
3201	when do the playoffs start ?	0
3202	in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?	0
3203	of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .	4
3204	Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .	4
3205	sure , that would be great .	4
3206	Ok , it's a date then !	4
3207	how are you ?	0
3208	I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .	0
3209	That ’ s for sure . You ’ re new , too , huh ?	0
3210	Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?	0
3211	Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it .	0
3212	Gave me the receipt , please .	0
3213	Here is my receipt .	0
3214	What's wrong with it ?	0
3215	It's too small for me to wear .	0
3216	Would you like another bigger one ?	0
3217	No thanks . I want to have a refund .	0
3218	OK , here is your money .	0
3219	Oh , so many kinds of winter hats .	4
3220	What is your favorite color , miss ?	0
3221	Red .	0
3222	Here you are.It ' s very attractive .	4
3223	May I try it on ?	0
3224	Go ahead .	0
3225	Is there a mirror around here ?	0
3226	Right over there .	0
3227	Does it suit me ?	0
3228	Yes , you look very nice .	0
3229	How much is it ?	0
3230	We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .	0
3231	That's quite reasonable .	4
3232	What can I help you with ?	0
3233	May I ask you something ?	0
3234	What's your question ?	0
3235	How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?	0
3236	What do you need to take it for ?	0
3237	I'm trying to get my license .	0
3238	You need six hours .	0
3239	Can I do all six hours in one day ?	0
3240	You have to do it in three days .	0
3241	That's all I have to do ?	0
3242	That's everything .	0
3243	Well , that's a relief .	4
3244	Excuse me , I have something to trouble you .	0
3245	Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .	0
3246	An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .	0
3247	Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?	0
3248	I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .	0
3249	Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?	0
3250	Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .	0
3251	It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?	0
3252	All right . Thank you .	4
3253	Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .	0
3254	Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .	0
3255	I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .	0
3256	Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .	0
3257	Here you are . You left the medicine here .	0
3258	Sorry . I was too worried .	0
3259	I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .	0
3260	Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?	0
3261	Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .	0
3262	I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .	0
3263	It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .	0
3264	What kind of place shall we rent ?	0
3265	It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .	0
3266	Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .	0
3267	Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?	0
3268	I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	0
3269	Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	0
3270	Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	0
3271	How much do you think the rent will be ?	0
3272	I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .	0
3273	I have a terrible toothache .	0
3274	Which tooth is it ?	0
3275	This one here .	0
3276	Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity .	0
3277	Can you fill it ?	0
3278	I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .	0
3279	Then I might as well have it done now .	0
3280	you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .	0
3281	May I have a look at that vase , please ?	0
3282	Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .	4
3283	Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .	0
3284	Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?	6
3285	Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ?	0
3286	The local newspaper has ads for housing .	0
3287	Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?	0
3288	Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .	0
3289	What do landlords charge for rent ?	0
3290	Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?	0
3291	There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .	0
3292	You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .	0
3293	I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .	0
3294	Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .	4
3295	Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ?	0
3296	With pleasure .	0
3297	I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .	0
3298	No problem .	0
3299	The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge .	0
3300	Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .	0
3301	Why is the price so high ?	0
3302	It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .	0
3303	Model of computers aren't compatible ?	0
3304	Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .	0
3305	Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .	0
3306	But by then , the technology will be outdated .	0
3307	True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .	0
3308	That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .	0
3309	This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .	0
3310	I guess you get what you pay for .	0
3311	What kind of permanent would you like to have ?	0
3312	what kinds do you have ?	0
3313	Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .	0
3314	Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .	0
3315	Hello ! How do I get more amenities ?	0
3316	I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .	0
3317	I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .	0
3318	Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .	0
3319	No , no . I've got plenty left .	0
3320	Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?	0
3321	What am I going to do about souvenirs ?	0
3322	Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !	4
3323	Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .	0
3324	Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .	0
3325	Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .	0
3326	I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .	0
3327	Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ?	0
3328	Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .	0
3329	That doesn't sound too bad .	0
3330	Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .	0
3331	Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .	4
3332	You're welcome .	4
3333	I'd like to order breakfast , please .	0

3339	How may I help you ?	0
3340	Could you cancel a check for me ?	0
3341	What ’ s the problem ?	0

3356	Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .	0

3358	Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?	0
3359	The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course .	0
3360	Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag .	0
3361	Is there a receipt ?	0

3368	I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .	0
3369	Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .	0
3370	Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .	0
3371	You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?	0
3372	Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .	0
3373	An excellent idea . Work now and play later .	4
3374	I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .	0
3375	No , now it's bedtime .	0
3376	Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?	0
3377	Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?	0
3378	Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .	0
3379	I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .	0
3380	Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?	0
3381	Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?	4
3382	That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?	0
3383	Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .	0
3384	I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .	5
3385	I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .	0
3386	Well , it's all new stock in the window now .	0
3387	May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?	0
3388	Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .	0
3389	Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .	0
3390	Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .	0
3391	Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .	4
3392	That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .	0
3393	There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .	4

3398	I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .	0
3399	But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .	0
3400	I agree that yours are of the top .	0
3401	Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?	0
3402	To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .	0
3403	Impossible . How about 5 % off ?	0
3404	Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .	0
3405	So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor .	0
3406	Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .	0
3407	I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ?	0
3408	People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .	0

3425	Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .	0
3426	That ’ s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?	0
3427	On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .	0
3428	That ’ s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .	0
3429	Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !	0
3430	I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things .	0
3431	Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .	0

3433	Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .	0
3434	That looks graceful on you .	4
3435	Thank you.But it is too bright for me .	4
3436	How about this brown one ?	0
3437	Let me try it on . I like that color .	0
3438	Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .	0
3439	But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?	0
3440	Sorry , it had been sold out .	5
3441	What a pity !	5
3442	I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan .	0
3443	How much would you like to borrow ?	0
3444	A thousand dollars .	0
3445	Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .	0
3446	What ’ s the current interest rate ?	0
3447	Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?	0
3448	And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside .	0
3449	When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant .	0
3450	My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .	4
3451	I wouldn't mind having one myself ...	0
3452	Model it for me .	0
3453	OK !	4
3454	Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !	4
3455	Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ?	0
3456	I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?	0
3457	That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .	0
3458	A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?	0
3459	A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .	0
3460	But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .	0
3461	We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .	0
3462	I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .	0
3463	Hello .	0
3464	Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ?	0
3465	No , Lily is not here at the moment .	0
3466	Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?	0
3467	Sure . What ’ s your number , please .	0
3468	519 367 8901 .	0
3469	Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?	0
3470	Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much .	4
3471	You ’ re welcome . Bye .	4
3472	Bye .	0
3473	So what do you think of my new dress ?	0
3474	I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .	4
3475	Um , ninety-five dollars ?	0
3476	Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?	0
3477	I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .	0
3478	Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?	0
3479	I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .	0
3480	Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ?	0
3481	I did . Why ?	0
3482	Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?	0
3483	No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .	5
3484	Is it Fred's fault ?	0
3485	No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake .	0
3486	But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .	0
3487	In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner .	0
3488	How to adjust ?	0
3489	Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .	0
3490	Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .	0
3491	That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .	0
3492	Yes , sometimes the differences are great .	0
3493	Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .	0
3494	We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .	0
3495	I hate doing the damn laundry .	1
3496	Watch your language .	0
3497	I want to buy three tickets . What's the entrance fee ?	0
3498	$ 10 per person .	0

3500	Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .	0
3501	Thanks a lot .	4
3502	Shall we share a taxi ?	0
3503	Where are you heading now ?	0
3504	I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .	0
3505	Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?	0
3506	That's the one .	0
3507	You mean we'll share the taxi ?	0
3508	Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .	0
3509	Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .	4
3510	Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ?	0
3511	My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?	0
3512	How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?	0
3513	Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .	0
3514	Oh , yes.How old are you ?	0
3515	Twenty .	0
3516	Hum , still a student ?	0
3517	Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .	0

3527	That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ?	4
3528	It ’ s too loud .	0
3529	We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?	1
3530	Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me .	0
3531	What style do you want ?	0
3532	I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .	0
3533	Oh , I see.How about the color ?	0
3534	Quiet color .	0
3535	I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .	0
3536	Really ? Let ’ s go there .	6
3537	Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?	0
3538	Sure ! What do you feel like having ?	4
3539	I really feel like having a big juicy steak !	4
3540	Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?	0
3541	I didn't know you were a vegetarian !	6
3542	I'm not , I am a vegan .	0
3543	A what ?	0
3544	A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .	0
3545	Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !	4
3546	It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .	0
3547	How do you feel about that restaurant ?	0
3548	It wasn't all that great .	0
3549	What did you dislike the most ?	0
3550	I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .	0
3551	Did you think that the food was any good ?	0
3552	I wasn't all that impressed by the food .	0
3553	The service certainly could have been better .	0
3554	The service did not help the situation .	0
3555	Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?	0
3556	I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .	2
3557	Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ?	0
3558	No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden .	0

3563	What are these ?	0
3564	They are my personal effects .	0
3565	I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went .	0
3566	First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?	0
3567	I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .	0
3568	I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .	0
3569	Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?	0
3570	Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .	0
3571	Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?	0
3572	You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .	0
3573	What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?	0
3574	There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .	0

3582	I have a question .	0
3583	What do you need to know ?	0

3606	Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .	0

3614	How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ?	0
3615	With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .	0
3616	I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .	0
3617	Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?	0

3993	Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .	0
3994	Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .	0
3995	Thank you .	4
3996	Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ?	0
3997	I'd love to .	0
3998	First , put away your toys .	0
3999	OK .	0
4000	I'll get the flour out .	0
4001	Let me help you .	0
4002	We have made some adjustment on the prices . And this is renewed price list .	0
4003	Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .	0
4004	This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .	0
4005	If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .	0
4006	Then what ’ s your counter-offer ?	0
4007	This is our counter-offer .	0
4008	We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .	0
4009	So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .	0
4010	How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?	0
4011	Agreed .	0
4012	What do you usually have for breakfast ? Pancakes or waffles ?	0
4013	I usually have cereal for breakfast .	0
4014	But isn't it served with cold milk ?	0
4015	Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .	0
4016	Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .	0
4017	Is that right ?	0
4018	But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .	0
4019	With cold milk ?	0
4020	With cold milk !	0
4021	I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season .	4
4022	That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .	4
4023	It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?	0
4024	That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .	0
4025	Certainly .	0
4026	Hi , I need to copy something right now .	0
4027	Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .	0
4028	Great ! How much per copy ?	0
4029	Sir , one copy is ten cents .	0
4030	Okay , I'll be down there shortly .	0
4031	You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .	0
4032	Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !	4
4033	Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .	4
4034	No , we just don ’ t usually admit it !	4
4035	Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !	4
4036	This Olympic park is so big !	6
4037	Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .	0
4038	Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?	6
4039	The whole stadium is to be finished this June .	0
4040	How many seats are there in the stand ?	0
4041	Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .	0
4042	I didn ’ t know it would be so big !	6
4043	It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there .	0
4044	Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing .	0
4045	We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors .	0
4046	It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown .	0
4047	OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .	0
4048	I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?	0
4049	Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .	0
4050	Oh , great idea !	4
4051	So , Monica , how do you like your new office ?	0
4052	Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !	4
4053	That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .	0
4054	What was so bad about it ?	0
4055	Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .	0
4056	Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .	0
4057	Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .	0
4058	Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ?	0
4059	Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 .	0
4060	Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .	4
4061	Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .	0
4062	Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ?	0
4063	Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York .	0
4064	What did that involve ?	0
4065	Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .	0
4066	I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?	0
4067	Yes , okay .	0
4068	Could you change these for me , please ?	0
4069	What would you like ?	0
4070	Twenties and some smaller bills , please .	0
4071	Anything else ?	0
4072	Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .	0
4073	Now , what seems to be the trouble ?	0
4074	It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .	0
4075	Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?	0
4076	Yes , I never seem to have any energy .	0
4077	I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .	0
4078	Thank you .	0
4079	Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing .	0
4080	Do you have a map of the campus ?	0
4081	Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps .	0
4082	Do you know where your classes are ?	0
4083	More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be .	0
4084	That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .	0
4085	Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth .	0
4086	Which train do you like ?	0
4087	T112 to Washington please .	0
4088	May I have your name ?	0
4089	That's Lincoln .	0
4090	Will you be voting ?	0
4091	I can ’ t wait to vote .	0
4092	Who are you voting for ?	0
4093	The person I ’ m voting for is the best .	0
4094	What do you like about him ?	0
4095	He is very intelligent .	0
4096	You think so ?	0
4097	That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies .	4
4098	I ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited .	4
4099	I ’ m voting for the next President .	4
4100	I ’ m sure he will be .	4
4101	I ’ m going to make sure and vote .	0
4102	Good morning . May I help you ?	0
4103	Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .	0
4104	One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?	0
4105	What's the 14 pounds for ?	0
4106	That's for the phone calls you made from your room .	0
4107	Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?	0
4108	Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?	0
4109	Here you are .	0
4110	Could you sign each cheque here for me ?	0
4111	Sure .	0
4112	Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .	4
4113	Thank you . Goodbye .	4
4114	What type of people do you work with most effectively ?	0
4115	I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .	0
4116	What things impress you in your colleagues ?	0
4117	I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .	0
4118	What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?	0
4119	The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .	0
4120	How do you organize and plan for major projects ?	0
4121	I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .	0
4122	Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .	0
4123	I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .	0
4124	How do you manage your time in a typical day ?	0
4125	I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .	0
4126	Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .	0
4127	I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .	0
4128	Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ?	0
4129	Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !	2
4130	I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .	0
4131	Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .	2
4132	It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .	0
4133	I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent .	5
4134	You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .	0
4135	What did he say ?	0
4136	He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .	0
4137	He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .	0
4138	Want to send out for some Chinese ?	0
4139	Some what ?	0
4140	Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .	0
4141	No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?	0
4142	Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .	0
4143	Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?	0
4144	Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .	0
4145	What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .	0
4146	Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .	0
4147	Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ?	0
4148	I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .	0
4149	It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .	0
4150	Is that true ?	6
4151	Definitely !	0
4152	If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .	0
4153	Hello sir , how may I help you ?	0
4154	I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .	0
4155	I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?	0
4156	It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry .	0
4157	Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .	0
4158	I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?	0
4159	Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .	0
4160	I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !	0
4161	I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?	6
4162	Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .	0
4163	Get out of my store , you jerk !	1
4164	I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?	1
4165	I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .	0
4166	You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?	1
4167	I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .	0
4168	Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .	0
4169	Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .	0
4170	How many people are on the waiting list right now ?	0
4171	Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .	0
4172	How do you think they could be ended ?	0
4173	I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .	0
4174	So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .	0
4175	It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .	0
4176	Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .	0
4177	You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .	0
4178	I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today .	0
4179	I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .	1
4180	You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now .	0
4181	What sort of job would you like to take ?	0
4182	I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .	0
4183	We need an operator now .	0
4184	It's just the job I've been searching for .	0
4185	I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .	0
4186	I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .	0
4187	And it takes up all the news .	0
4188	The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .	0
4189	It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .	0
4190	Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .	0
4191	I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .	0
4192	Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .	0
4193	Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?	0
4194	I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?	0
4195	Sure . No problem .	0
4196	Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?	0
4197	Sure . Do you have my number ?	0
4198	Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .	0
4199	No problem . I'll wait for your call .	0
4200	What are you typing there ?	0
4201	I'm working on my resume .	0
4202	Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?	6
4203	Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .	0
4204	Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?	4
4205	I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .	0
4206	Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .	0
4207	Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .	0
4208	But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .	0
4209	How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?	0
4210	Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?	0
4211	Is this the one you want ?	0
4212	No , the one next to it .	0
4213	Here you are .	0
4214	Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?	0
4215	It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?	0
4216	Yes , please . How much is it ?	0
4217	It costs $ 200 .	0
4218	It looks good . OK . I'll take it .	4
4219	Happy birthday , Jim !	4
4220	Thank you , Lisa .	4
4221	Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .	4
4222	Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .	6
4223	I'm very glad to hear that .	4
4224	Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .	0
4225	What's wrong with you ? You look pale .	0
4226	I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .	0
4227	When did the trouble start ?	0
4228	I was sick most of the night .	0
4229	It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .	0
4230	Have I got a high fever ?	0
4231	Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?	0
4232	Yes , I have .	0
4233	Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '	0
4234	Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .	0
4235	Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .	0
4236	All right , thanks .	0
4237	The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .	0
4238	What shall I do today ?	0
4239	I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .	0
4240	I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .	0
4241	You can be sure of that , sir .	0
4242	Thank you .	0
4243	I called HP about my computer .	0
4244	What did they say ?	0
4245	They said I need a new hard drive .	0
4246	That's too bad . How much is a new one ?	0
4247	It's not too much , only about $ 85 .	0
4248	Plus installation ?	0
4249	No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .	0
4250	Really ?	0
4251	Yes , it's just a couple of screws .	0
4252	That's nice .	4
4253	It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .	0
4254	If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .	0
4255	Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .	0
4256	Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .	0
4257	Yes , Mum .	0
4258	Is there anything wrong ?	0
4259	I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college .	0
4260	Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .	0
4261	I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .	0
4262	You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .	0
4263	But I just want to give her some tips .	0
4264	Oh , she can make her own decisions .	0
4265	I guess you are right .	0
4266	Believe me . Everything will be ok .	0
4267	I hope so .	0
4268	It's beautiful here .	4
4269	Yes . I feel refreshed .	4
4270	How long will we dock ?	0
4271	In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .	0
4272	Yes . We come at the right time .	0
4273	that was a really good meal , Gordon .	4
4274	It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .	4
4275	well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .	0
4276	you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .	0
4277	let's see how much the bill is .	0
4278	don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .	0
4279	what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .	0
4280	no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .	0
4281	no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .	0
4282	alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .	0
4283	that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .	0
4284	just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?	0
4285	you've got a deal .	4
4286	great . Bye .	4
4287	bye .	4
4288	I hear you are planning to travel abroad .	0
4289	Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?	0
4290	In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .	0
4291	Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .	0
4292	Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .	0
4293	And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .	0
4294	This looks like a very nice house .	4
4295	You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .	4
4296	The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !	4
4297	The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .	4
4298	This home is gorgeous on the inside !	4
4299	Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .	0
4300	The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .	4
4301	Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .	0
4302	I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .	4
4303	The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next .	4
4304	There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .	4
4305	I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .	0

4312	Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?	0
4313	Next Monday .	0
4314	Will that be first class or economy seat ?	0
4315	What's the fare for a first class seat ?	0
4316	$ 200 .	0
4317	Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please .	0
4318	Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?	0
4319	Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .	0
4320	That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .	0
4321	And I can purchase that here ?	0
4322	Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .	0
4323	Are there any beds vacant ?	0
4324	Yes , what kind of room do you want ?	0
4325	I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .	0
4326	Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .	0
4327	Well , that's fine .	0
4328	Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .	0
4329	That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .	0
4330	You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?	6
4331	Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t	0
4332	Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?	0
4333	Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .	0
4334	Well , welcome to the team .	0
4335	Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .	0
4336	Oh , thank you .	0
4337	Is there anything I can do for you now ?	0
4338	Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .	0
4339	Certainly , sir .	0
4340	Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?	0
4341	Marry Lin please .	0

4343	All right , could I leave a message ?	0
4344	Certainly !	0
4345	Please ask her to call John .	0
4346	Excuse me . Where is the way out ?	0
4347	Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .	0
4348	It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?	0
4349	Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?	0
4350	It should be the way out .	0
4351	OK . Let's go and see .	0
4352	Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .	0
4353	Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .	5
4354	I think you should be more careful next time .	0
4355	Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .	5
4356	Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .	0
4357	Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .	0
4358	No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all .	0
4359	Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way .	5
4360	Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?	0
4361	Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?	0
4362	Things are going well for me , Joe .	0
4363	Want to go see a movie tonight ?	0
4364	My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .	0
4365	Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?	0
4366	What movie did you want to see ?	0
4367	There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .	0
4368	I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”	0
4369	Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !	0
4370	How's the bride-to-be ?	0
4371	Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .	5
4372	Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !	4
4373	I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !	3
4374	Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .	0
4375	You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...	0
4376	I will . Don't worry !	4
4377	Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?	0
4378	Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .	0
4379	Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .	6
4380	I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .	0
4381	Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?	0
4382	Nothing .	0
4383	What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .	0
4384	Promise that you won't get angry .	3
4385	OK , I promise . What is it ?	0
4386	It's a kitty .	0
4387	Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .	1
4388	Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .	0
4389	No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .	1
4390	Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .	0
4391	All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .	0
4392	I will . Thank you , Mummy .	4
4393	I was wondering if you could help me with something .	0
4394	Sure , anything you say .	4
4395	Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .	0
4396	Don ’ t worry about it , just ask .	4
4397	What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?	0
4398	You need to know the type of shoes you want .	0
4399	Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .	0
4400	The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .	0
4401	Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon .	0
4402	Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?	0
4403	It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .	0
4404	So , it has a history for more than a decade ?	0
4405	Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .	0
4406	What can I do for you , Madam ?	0
4407	Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?	0
4408	Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?	0
4409	Well , everything really .	0
4410	All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .	0
4411	Let's do something outdoors today .	0
4412	All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .	0
4413	Okay . what do you want to do ?	0
4414	I want to go jogging .	0
4415	All right . That sounds like fun .	4
4416	Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note .	0
4417	I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .	0
4418	But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .	0
4419	The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .	0
4420	Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .	0
4421	No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .	0
4422	You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?	0
4423	Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .	0
4424	Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?	0
4425	Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .	0
4426	Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?	0
4427	Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .	4
4428	Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?	0
4429	We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .	0
4430	You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .	0
4431	OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?	0
4432	I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .	0
4433	OK , will do .	0
4434	I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .	0
4435	What size do you want ?	0
4436	I wear size 40 .	0
4437	How about this one ? It's the latest design .	0
4438	Oh , I like the color .	4
4439	May I help you ?	0
4440	I'm looking for a pair of shoes .	0
4441	What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .	0
4442	I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ?	0
4443	Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .	4
4444	How much are they ?	0
4445	They are $ 168 .	0
4446	I'll take them .	0
4447	A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?	0
4448	I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?	0
4449	Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .	0
4450	Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .	0
4451	Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .	0
4452	Ok , then we can sign up for it together .	0
4453	Who's it knocking at the door ?	0
4454	I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ?	0
4455	All right . I'll get it .	0
4456	Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?	0
4457	No , we don't .	0
4458	How many of you , please ?	0
4459	Six , including two kids .	0
4460	I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .	0
4461	Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .	0
4462	If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .	0
4463	Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?	0
4464	I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .	0
4465	Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?	0
4466	Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .	0
4467	How will I know what the numbers mean ?	0
4468	You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .	0
4469	How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?	0
4470	We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .	0
4471	This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .	0
4472	If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .	0
4473	What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .	0
4474	I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?	0
4475	What's your proposal ?	0
4476	Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .	0
4477	Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !	0
4478	What would you suggest ?	0
4479	The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .	0
4480	That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .	0
4481	OK . We can meet halfway again .	0
4482	Hello .	0
4483	Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?	0
4484	No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?	0
4485	Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?	0
4486	B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .	0
4487	Oh , you mean Canal Street ?	6
4488	That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .	0
4489	Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?	0
4490	At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?	0
4491	I cannot get hold of her yet .	0
4492	See you around , Carl .	0
4493	See you later .	0
4494	Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?	0
4495	Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .	0
4496	What about your use of raw materials ?	0
4497	Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .	0
4498	What happens if you exceed the limits ?	0
4499	We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .	0
4500	Have you got any better ?	0
4501	That's the best there is .	0
4502	Okay , I'll take one .	0
4503	That'll be $ 200 , sir .	0
4504	Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?	0
4505	Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?	0
4506	No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .	4
4507	What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?	0
4508	External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .	0
4509	What are the internal factors that influence the company ?	0
4510	The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .	0
4511	I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .	0
4512	What words ? Can you tell me ?	0
4513	He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .	0
4514	Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .	0
4515	Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .	0
4516	I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .	0
4517	It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .	0
4518	Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .	0
4519	I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .	0
4520	How can I help you ?	0
4521	Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .	0
4522	Do you have an appointment ?	0
4523	Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .	0
4524	I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?	0
4525	Sure .	0
4526	Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?	0
4527	That would be very nice . Thank you .	0
4528	Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared	0
4529	did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?	0
4530	no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .	0
4531	yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .	0
4532	they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .	0
4533	they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .	0
4534	I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .	0
4535	did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?	0
4536	I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .	0
4537	Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?	0
4538	yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .	0
4539	I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .	0
4540	people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .	0
4541	I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .	0
4542	that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .	0
4543	thank goodness we're not rich and famous !	0
4544	being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .	0
4545	Next , please .	0
4546	Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .	0
4547	Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .	0
4548	Yes , I have known of it .	0
4549	How much do you like to exchange ?	0
4550	20,000 RIB .	0
4551	In what denominations ?	0
4552	It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .	0
4553	Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .	0
4554	Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .	0
4555	OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .	0
4556	It doesn't matter .	0
4557	Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .	0
4558	Thanks a lot . Good-bye .	0
4559	Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?	0
4560	We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .	0
4561	I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?	0
4562	That would be nice . How are you getting there ?	0
4563	Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .	0
4564	Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...	0
4565	And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .	0
4566	Which is more expensive ?	0
4567	But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .	0
4568	Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?	0
4569	I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .	0
4570	What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?	4
4571	Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .	0
4572	They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like .	4
4573	I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .	0
4574	Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next .	4
4575	I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .	4
4576	I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .	0
4577	Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?	0
4578	The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .	0
4579	Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?	0

4581	A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...	0
4582	Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .	0
4583	Isn't this the car store ?	0
4584	No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .	0
4585	Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?	0
4586	No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .	0
4587	I'm sorry to have bothered you .	5
4588	No problem .	4
4589	How about going to the cinema tonight ?	0
4590	That's great . What's on tonight ?	0
4591	I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .	0
4592	Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .	0
4593	Don't you think it's too bloody ?	0
4594	On the contrary , very exciting .	4
4595	Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day .	0

4659	I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .	0
4660	I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .	0
4661	Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?	0
4662	No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .	0
4663	Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?	0
4664	Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .	0
4665	Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .	4

4681	Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job .	0
4682	Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ?	0
4683	Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .	0
4684	How can I have the good external expressions ?	0
4685	Don ’ t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .	0
4686	Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...	1

4698	I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .	0
4699	I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?	0
4700	I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .	0
4701	OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?	0
4702	What were you planning on seeing ?	0
4703	I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .	0
4704	How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?	0
4705	That's a chick flick !	0
4706	What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?	0
4707	First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .	0
4708	That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .	0
4709	I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of	0
4710	Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .	0
4711	Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ?	0
4712	The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?	0
4713	Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .	0
4714	When will the branch office open ?	0
4715	Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .	0
4716	Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?	0
4717	Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines .	0
4718	I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .	0
4719	Good afternoon . what can I do for you ?	0
4720	I want to pick up my valuables .	0
4721	May I have your key please ?	0
4722	Sure . Here you are .	0
4723	Here is your valuable . Is that right ?	0
4724	Yes , thank you .	4
4725	did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?	0
4726	why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .	0
4727	well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .	0
4728	do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?	0
4729	no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .	0
4730	it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .	0
4731	religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .	0
4732	what do you think about abortion ?	0
4733	I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .	0
4734	do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?	0
4735	I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .	0
4736	why not ? It's their children , too .	0
4737	that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .	0
4738	that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .	0
4739	Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .	0
4740	But I don't have any reading assignments .	0
4741	Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .	0
4742	Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .	1
4743	You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .	0
4744	I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .	0
4745	Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .	0
4746	Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?	0
4747	We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply .	0
4748	I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .	0
4749	How did you find your apartment ?	0
4750	You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .	0
4751	What if I need a roommate ?	0
4752	There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .	0
4753	How much do apartments cost around here ?	0
4754	It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?	0
4755	I just need a one-bedroom apartment .	0
4756	That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .	0
4757	Would you come with me to look at apartments ?	0
4758	I would be happy to look at apartments with you .	4
4759	Have you heard what happened ?	0
4760	Heard what ?	0
4761	Deborah already had her baby .	0
4762	I didn't know that .	0
4763	I thought you knew .	0
4764	I honestly didn't know .	0
4765	The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .	0
4766	That's good to hear .	4
4767	Will you go and visit them ?	0
4768	Of course I will .	0
4769	I just wanted to give you the good news .	0
4770	Thanks for letting me know .	0
4771	How silly of you to jump out of the window !	6
4772	But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !	0
4773	Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .	0
4774	That would be too late .	0
4775	Maybe the situation is too urgent .	0
4776	Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .	0
4777	I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .	0
4778	I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .	0
4779	What foods do you eat now ?	0
4780	I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .	0
4781	Those are the only things you eat ?	0
4782	That's basically what I eat .	0
4783	Why aren't you eating anything else ?	0
4784	Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .	0
4785	And the chicken ?	0
4786	It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .	0
4787	I guess that does sound a lot healthier .	4
4788	Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .	4

4795	You are welcome .	4
4796	Do you have experience in advertising ?	0
4797	Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .	0
4798	What were you mean duties there ?	0
4799	I mostly did advertising planning .	0
4800	What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?	0
4801	I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .	0
4802	What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?	0
4803	The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .	0
4804	The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !	0
4805	Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .	0
4806	That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !	0
4807	Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .	0
4808	I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .	0
4809	Do you have anything to do after this ?	0
4810	No , I don't .	0
4811	Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?	4
4812	That sounds like a good idea .	4
4813	I know a very interesting place .	4
4814	Oh , do you ? Good .	4

4818	I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .	0
4819	I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .	0
4820	I know . I wonder what's keeping him .	0
4821	Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?	0
4822	Yeah , a number of times .	0
4823	What's he trying to pull anyway .	0
4824	I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .	0
4825	Maybe you should start seeing someone else .	0
4826	You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .	0
4827	I can't believe how hot it is .	0

4866	Is it easy to learn ?	0
4867	Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .	0

4869	Right . Let's help each other .	4
4870	When was America discovered , Tony ?	0
4871	I'm not certain . Do you know ?	0
4872	America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .	0

4893	You have much patience .	0
4894	Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !	4

4904	I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love .	0
4905	Very romantic ?	0
4906	Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .	0
4907	You married him for that reason ?	0
4908	Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other .	0
4909	It seldom rains this summer .	0
4910	Yeah , some places are very short of water .	0
4911	Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .	0
4912	You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .	0
4913	It is serious .	0
4914	I'm looking forward to summer vacation .	4
4915	Me too .	4
4916	My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help .	4
4917	She does have a heart of gold .	0
4918	You can say that again .	4
4919	Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !	0
4920	You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?	0
4921	Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !	0
4922	Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .	0
4923	Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .	0
4924	All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .	0
4925	Can I help you , sir ?	0
4926	Yes , I'd like a book about law .	0
4927	Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?	0

4954	I don't know . It's a rental .	0
4955	I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?	0
4956	Sure , why not ?	0
4957	That is the pump you are in front of .	0
4958	Is it expensive ?	0
4959	It is the most expensive .	0
4960	Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?	0
4961	Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .	0
4962	Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?	0
4963	I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .	5
4964	Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .	6
4965	Mary , it's good to see you !	4
4966	Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .	4
4967	I am so glad that you decided to stop by !	4
4968	Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .	4
4969	Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?	4
4970	Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .	0
4971	How about a little snack then ?	4
4972	No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .	0
4973	Well then , how is your family ?	0
4974	Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .	0
4975	Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .	4
4976	Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .	0
4977	Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !	4
4978	Stop making fun of me .	0
4979	So find a guy to marry and you can get one !	4
4980	I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !	0
4981	Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .	4
4982	I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .	4
4983	Congratulation . What will you do ?	4
4984	They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .	0
4985	That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .	4
4986	It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .	0
4987	Good . I'll do it .	4
4988	Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?	0
4989	Only once or twice at the most .	0
4990	Do you know why ?	0
4991	I have no idea .	0
4992	Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .	4
4993	You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .	4
4994	Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .	4
4995	You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .	4
4996	No wonder people say	4
4997	Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !	6
4998	I didn't know you liked bird-watching .	4
4999	I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .	4
5000	Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !	0
5001	Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .	0
5002	It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .	0
5003	Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .	0
5004	Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !	0
5005	Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way .	0
5006	hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .	4
5007	of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .	0
5008	yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .	0
5009	how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?	0
5010	oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn	0
5011	yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better	0
5012	oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .	4
5013	definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .	4
5014	sounds great ! I'll be there .	4
5015	I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...	0
5016	and what if it doesn't work out , right ?	0
5017	Exactly .	0
5018	You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?	0
5019	How ?	0
5020	Because I won't let it fail .	0
5021	But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?	0
5022	Are you ready for the camping trip ?	0
5023	All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...	0
5024	Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .	0
5025	Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?	0
5026	I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .	0
5027	Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?	0
5028	That's trail mix !	0
5029	Same difference . What's this ?	0
5030	It's getting late . I really have to go .	0
5031	I hope we'll get together again soon .	0
5032	I hope so . A good journey to you !	4
5033	Thank you .	4
5034	I ’ m fed up with marriage .	0
5035	Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .	0
5036	Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .	0
5037	But now you are rich .	0
5038	And we have some squabbles on some boring things .	0
5039	This is ordinary marriage life .	0
5040	How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ?	0
5041	Don ’ t be kidding , OK ?	1
5042	What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you .	0
5043	Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .	1
5044	Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?	0
5045	Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .	0
5046	Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .	0
5047	Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .	0
5048	Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .	0
5049	That's a problem .	0
5050	What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?	0
5051	It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?	0
5052	I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?	0
5053	I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .	0
5054	What other kind of music do you listen to ?	0
5055	Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?	0
5056	To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .	0
5057	What kind of music do you prefer then ?	0
5058	I like pop music . Do you ?	0
5059	Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .	0
5060	I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .	0
5061	How long have you been in to pop music , then ?	0
5062	I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?	0
5063	Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .	0
5064	So , how did you become interested in it ?	0
5065	Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .	0
5066	Do you still play piano ?	0
5067	Yes , it's one of my hobbies .	0
5068	Hi Paul . How are you , friend .	0
5069	Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .	2
5070	How so ?	0
5071	He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .	2
5072	Have you talk to him about it ?	0
5073	Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night	2
5074	Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .	0
5075	This is no laughing matter , Nick .	0
5076	Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?	0
5077	He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .	0
5078	Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?	0
5079	You're from New York , aren't you ?	0
5080	Yes , that's right .	0
5081	What do you suggest I should see in New York ?	0
5082	Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?	0
5083	No , I don't like museums . They're boring .	0
5084	Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?	0
5085	Ah ! That sounds interesting .	4
5086	What's your favorite book ?	0
5087	It's Gone With the Wind .	0
5088	Why do you like it best ?	0
5089	I enjoy the various characters and the plot .	4
5090	Well . I like the Thom Birds best .	0
5091	Is it very interesting ?	0
5092	Sure . I like the writer's language , too .	0
5093	If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .	0
5094	Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?	4
5095	That's a good idea . Let's go !	4
5096	John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?	6
5097	Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?	0
5098	It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .	0
5099	You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?	0
5100	I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer .	0
5101	How can you be so sure ?	0
5102	He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too .	0
5103	Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?	0
5104	Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ?	0
5105	Yes , but I have never taken his class before .	0
5106	He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ?	0
5107	Yes , that's what I need .	0
5108	He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?	0
5109	Yes , I guess so .	0
5110	What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ?	0
5111	Yes , I had a teacher like that before .	0
5112	Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?	0
5113	No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing .	0
5114	Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck !	4
5115	Honey , what's wrong with you ?	0
5116	I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous .	0
5117	Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .	0
5118	Yeah , I know .	0
5119	The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .	0
5120	Thank you , dear . I feel better now .	4
5121	The weather is terrible .	0
5122	Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days .	0
5123	I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .	0
5124	Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?	0
5125	I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .	0
5126	That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?	0
5127	I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .	0
5128	I'm with you . What do you have in mind ?	0
5129	I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .	0
5130	That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .	4
5131	Great . I'll stop by your place now .	4
5132	Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime .	4
5133	Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?	0
5134	Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?	0
5135	Yes , I am applying on it .	0
5136	I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ...	0
5137	Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .	0
5138	I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .	0
5139	Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .	0
5140	Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .	4
5141	... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?	0
5142	Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .	0
5143	You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?	1
5144	But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .	0
5145	He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .	5
5146	Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .	0
5147	But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !	5
5148	You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...	0
5149	No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ...	5
5150	do you hear something ?	0
5151	what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .	0
5152	to be honest , I was just dumped .	5
5153	oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .	0
5154	no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .	5
5155	come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?	0
5156	I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .	0
5157	well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?	0
5158	where is that ?	0
5159	not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .	0
5160	what's there to see ?	0
5161	there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .	0
5162	oh , sounds nice .	4
5163	yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .	0
5164	ok . Then I can make up my mind .	4
5165	Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?	0
5166	Yes , just once .	0
5167	What was the reason ?	0
5168	I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan .	0
5169	Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?	0
5170	Oh , I can't . I have a date !	0
5171	Really ? Wow with who ?	6
5172	This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .	0
5173	Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?	0
5174	Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .	0
5175	That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?	0
5176	It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .	0
5177	I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !	0
5178	Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .	0
5179	Stay for dinner with us .	4
5180	I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .	0
5181	Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .	4
5182	It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .	4
5183	Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .	4
5184	Honey , do you have a second ?	0
5185	Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ?	0
5186	We need to talk .	0
5187	Okay ...	0
5188	I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .	0
5189	What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?	6
5190	That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !	5
5191	So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ?	6
5192	Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .	5
5193	Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me .	5
5194	I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .	5
5195	Laura ...	5
5196	Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye .	5
5197	Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .	0
5198	What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .	0
5199	I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .	0
5200	Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .	0
5201	You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?	0
5202	But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .	0
5203	Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .	0
5204	Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .	0
5205	I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .	0
5206	Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .	0
5207	That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .	0
5208	How about a training course ?	0
5209	A training course ? That must be costly .	0
5210	But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .	0
5211	OK , let's have a try .	0
5212	OK .	0
5213	Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?	0
5214	Oh , yes . You ?	0
5215	Yes . What did you think of it ?	0
5216	I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?	4
5217	Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?	4
5218	Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .	4
5219	Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?	0
5220	Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?	0
5221	Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?	0
5222	Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?	4
5223	I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !	4
5224	Yes !	4
5225	My friend Jean is very beautiful .	4
5226	What's her figure ?	0
5227	Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .	4
5228	What's the color of her eyes ?	0
5229	Dark blue .	4
5230	Where are you going ?	0
5231	I'm going to buy a CD .	0
5232	Why not listen to music online ?	0
5233	Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?	0
5234	You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .	0
5235	I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .	0
5236	In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .	0
5237	Can you recommend some to me ?	0
5238	Certainly . Realplayer is a good .	0
5239	Can I download it ?	0
5240	Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .	0
5241	I'll try it tonight .	0
5242	What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .	0
5243	Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .	0
5244	Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?	0
5245	He asked me how long it took me to learn English .	0
5246	But , you were born and raised in California !	6
5247	Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .	0
5248	What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?	6
5249	You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .	0
5250	So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?	0
5251	I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .	0
5252	Are you sure he really got the message ?	0
5253	Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .	0
5254	That's hilarious ! What did he say ?	0
5255	He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .	0
5256	I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .	0
5257	Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?	0

5289	you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .	0
5290	ok , where and when should I meet you ?	0
5291	we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !	4
5292	I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .	0
5293	It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .	0
5294	I give up ! I simply can't learn French !	0
5295	Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .	0
5296	No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .	0
5297	Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?	0

5305	My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?	4

5309	I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .	0

5311	It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .	4
5312	Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old .	0

5315	Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?	0

5338	Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .	0
5339	How can we keep track of our grades ?	0
5340	The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .	0
5341	What if we can't get to school ?	0
5342	You can only miss one class without penalty .	0
5343	If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?	0

5347	There is that .	0
5348	I believe it'll be very expensive .	0
5349	May I help you with something ?	0
5350	I would like to return some books .	0
5351	I ’ ll take them .	0
5352	Here you go .	0
5353	These books were due two weeks ago .	0
5354	Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .	0
5355	You will need to pay late fees on these books .	0
5356	How much are the late fees ?	0
5357	The fee is 25 cents every day .	0
5358	I have to pay 25 cents a day ?	6
5359	And that ’ s for each book that is late .	0
5360	That shouldn ’ t be a problem .	0
5361	This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !	4
5362	It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip .	4
5363	Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !	4
5364	I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier !	0
5365	Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far !	0
5366	It ’ s fine . Jump in !	0
5367	Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !	0

5369	It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! !	0
5370	what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?	0
5371	my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .	0
5372	three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !	0
5373	well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .	0
5374	were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?	0
5375	I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .	0
5376	did your husband's family get to meet your family ?	0
5377	my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t	0
5378	that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?	0
5379	we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .	0
5380	you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?	0
5381	not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !	0
5382	Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?	0
5383	I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .	0
5384	Then let's go in .	0

5389	Yeah , a number of times .	5
5390	What's he trying to pull anyway .	0
5391	I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .	5
5392	Maybe you should start seeing someone else .	0
5393	You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .	4

5405	Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ?	0

5417	Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .	4
5418	Do you watch a lot of TV ?	0
5419	Not really . I could take it or leave it .	0
5420	Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .	0

5426	No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?	0
5427	Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .	0
5428	Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?	0
5429	I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .	0
5430	I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .	0
5431	Why were you in Japan ?	0
5432	My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .	0
5433	That's pretty cool .	4
5434	I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .	0
5435	Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .	0
5436	Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .	4
5437	Ok .	0
5438	Guess who I saw just now ?	0
5439	Who ?	0
5440	John Smith , the escaped criminal .	0
5441	That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .	2
5442	I think I must report to the cops .	0
5443	Ok .	0
5444	What do you think of this one ?	0
5445	Eh , so so .	0
5446	And this one ? Too flashy ?	0
5447	Nah , not too flashy .	0
5448	Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?	0
5449	I guess .	0
5450	Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .	0
5451	And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !	1
5452	Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !	1
5453	Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first !	1
5454	Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !	1
5455	Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?	1
5456	I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !	1
5457	Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .	0
5458	Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .	0
5459	I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .	0
5460	I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .	0
5461	It must have really hurt afterwards .	0
5462	Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .	0
5463	I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .	0
5464	I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !	0
5465	Is there any pain now ?	0
5466	No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .	0
5467	Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?	0
5468	Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .	0
5469	How was the party ?	0
5470	I had a fantastic time .	4
5471	Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?	0
5472	Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .	0
5473	Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?	6
5474	I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .	0
5475	That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .	4
5476	Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .	4
5477	Ok , good luck to you .	4
5478	Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?	0
5479	Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .	0
5480	But he seems to be very happy with Rose .	0
5481	He is more nice than wise .	0
5482	Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?	0
5483	Yes , is that you , Allen ?	0
5484	Yes , how are you doing ?	0
5485	Not bad .	4
5486	Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?	4
5487	Sure.Thank you very much .	4
5488	Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?	4
5489	Ok , see you .	4
5490	See you .	4
5491	The weather has been terrible this week .	0
5492	Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .	0
5493	Let's hope it clears up .	0
5494	Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?	1
5495	Yeah , I'm afraid so .	1
5496	If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .	1
5497	Yes , it is annoying .	1
5498	Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?	0
5499	Nothing particular . But , ...	0
5500	What's the matter ?	0
5501	I , I don't know how to explain it to you .	0
5502	Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?	0
5503	Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you .	0
5504	How do you do ?	0
5505	How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card .	0
5506	It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .	4
5507	Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .	0
5508	Thank you .	4
5509	Thanks for your hospitality .	4
5510	You're welcome .	4
5511	I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .	5
5512	That's all right .	0
5513	Hey , what's new ?	0
5514	Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?	0
5515	Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .	0
5516	What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?	0
5517	Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .	0
5518	That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .	0
5519	But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .	0
5520	Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?	4
5521	That sounds great . Where are you going ?	4
5522	I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .	4
5523	What should I bring ?	4
5524	Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .	4
5525	What do you think of doctor Thomson ?	0
5526	I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .	0
5527	How can you be so sure ?	0
5528	I can tell form the way he spoke to us .	0
5529	Never believe his words .	0
5530	Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .	0
5531	I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .	0
5532	Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .	0
5533	Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .	0
5534	What do you think about violence in movies ?	0
5535	Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .	0
5536	But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?	0
5537	If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .	0
5538	Are you free tomorrow night ?	0
5539	Yes , I am .	0
5540	Shall we have dinner together ?	4
5541	Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?	4
5542	Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .	4
5543	OK . I'll be happy to join you .	4
5544	If only our company prescribe flex time .	0
5545	The board has been considering introducing flex time .	0
5546	Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .	4
5547	Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .	4
5548	Brian , do you know how to speak English ?	0
5549	Yes .	0
5550	Where did you learn ?	0
5551	I learned in college .	0
5552	You speak really well .	4
5553	Thank you .	4
5554	How long have you been in the U . S . ?	0
5555	3 weeks .	0
5556	Is your wife with you ?	0
5557	Yes , she just got here yesterday .	0
5558	Have you been to California before ?	0
5559	No . I've never been there .	0
5560	Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?	0
5561	Yes . I went there once on a business trip .	0
5562	How are the children doing at sport ?	0
5563	I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age .	0
5564	He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?	0
5565	He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .	0
5566	Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?	0
5567	The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .	0
5568	How are they at swimming ?	0
5569	They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .	0
5570	Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .	0
5571	I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !	3
5572	I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .	0
5573	It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .	0
5574	Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?	4
5575	Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .	4
5576	Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .	4
5577	Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...	4
5578	Is everything ready now ?	4
5579	Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .	4
5580	Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .	4
5581	Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .	4
5582	It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .	4
5583	That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .	4
5584	I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .	4
5585	Thank you .	4
5586	My pleasure .	4
5587	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?	1
5588	Sorry , I thought you knew .	0
5589	But you should have told me you were in love with her .	1
5590	Didn't I ?	0
5591	You know you didn't .	1
5592	Well , I'm telling you now .	0
5593	Yes , but you might have told me before .	1
5594	I didn't think you'd be interested .	0
5595	You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?	1
5596	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .	0
5597	Oh , you men ! You're all the same .	1
5598	Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?	0
5599	Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .	0
5600	What about water pollution instead of pollution ?	0
5601	How ’ s it going ?	0
5602	I ’ m fine . Thank you .	0
5603	Do you need anything ?	0
5604	I need you to help me .	0
5605	What can I do for you ?	0
5606	I am looking for an article in a newspaper .	0
5607	Did you check the periodicals ?	0
5608	I didn ’ t even bother to think of that .	0
5609	I ’ ll show you where to find your article .	0
5610	I get lost in this library .	0
5611	It ’ s right this way .	0
5612	Thanks a lot for your help .	4
5613	How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .	0
5614	Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?	0
5615	No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?	4
5616	All right . See you tomorrow night .	4
5617	Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?	0
5618	I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .	0
5619	Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .	0
5620	I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .	5
5621	Why don't you take a few days off ?	0
5622	I can't . I am really behind of my work .	5
5623	Can you speak Japanese ?	0
5624	Yes , I can , but not very well .	0
5625	Where did you learn it ?	0
5626	At school . And I'm still learning it now .	0
5627	How long have you been learning it ?	0
5628	About three years .	0
5629	Can you speak any other languages ?	0
5630	I'm afraid not .	0
5631	Good afternoon , Johnson .	0
5632	Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?	0
5633	Not bad , thanks .	4
5634	I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !	2
5635	God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?	0
5636	Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .	0
5637	They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .	0
5638	I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .	0
5639	You'd better pay more attention to your health .	0
5640	I will , thanks for your concern .	4
5641	You're welcome .	4
5642	It is too bad today .	0
5643	What happened ?	0
5644	My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .	0
5645	How did you find him at last ?	0
5646	It was the police wo helped me to do that .	0
5647	It must have taught you a lesson this time .	0
5648	I want to give our kitchen the works .	0
5649	Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good .	0
5650	No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .	0
5651	Why should we run after the fashion ?	0
5652	I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .	0
5653	Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?	4
5654	I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .	4
5655	Then tell me what's good about it .	4
5656	It can't be expressed by words .	4
5657	What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .	0
5658	I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .	0
5659	Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .	4
5660	Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .	4
5661	Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .	4
5662	I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .	4
5663	Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?	4
5664	Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .	4
5665	Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .	0
5666	That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .	4
5667	Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .	4
5668	Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .	4
5669	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?	0
5670	What ? Why do we have to do that ?	0
5671	Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .	0
5672	I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !	0
5673	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !	0
5674	That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time !	0
5675	I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?	0
5676	Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .	4
5677	I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .	0
5678	Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?	0
5679	I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .	0
5680	You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ?	0
5681	You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .	0
5682	It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .	4
5683	How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?	0
5684	We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .	0
5685	Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .	0
5686	But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .	0
5687	How do you celebrate national day in your country ?	0
5688	There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .	0
5689	What kinds of parades are there ?	0
5690	The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?	0
5691	We don ’ t have a national day .	0
5692	Really ? That ’ s unusual .	6
5693	I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t .	0
5694	Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .	0
5695	Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ?	0
5696	No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .	0
5697	Where do your parents live ?	0
5698	My father lives in Washington DC .	0
5699	How about your mother ?	0
5700	My mother died two years ago .	0
5701	Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?	0
5702	No , he's retired .	0
5703	Do you have any family here ?	0
5704	Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .	0
5705	Do you have any brothers or sisters ?	0
5706	Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .	0
5707	Do you see them a lot ?	0
5708	Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .	0
5709	Hey , how was the show ?	0
5710	Not great . It's a kind of boring .	5
5711	Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .	6
5712	Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .	5
5713	What happened , John ?	0
5714	Nothing .	0
5715	Why do you look unhappy ?	0
5716	I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .	0
5717	Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you .	0
5718	I hope so .	0
5719	You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .	0
5720	Really ?	6
5721	But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .	0
5722	You're right .	0
5723	Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .	4
5724	That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .	4
5725	Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?	0
5726	Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?	0
5727	No problem . See you !	4
5728	See you !	4
5729	Do you like ethnic food ?	0
5730	I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .	4
5731	Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?	6
5732	I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ?	0
5733	I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .	0
5734	Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ?	0
5735	As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .	0
5736	Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !	4
5737	Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .	0
5738	But not as good as your mother's , right ?	0
5739	Actually , it's better ...	0
5740	What ? Are you kidding ?	6
5741	No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...	0
5742	Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !	4
5743	OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...	4
5744	How many people are there in your family ?	0
5745	Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .	0
5746	Is your brother older or younger than you ?	0
5747	He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .	0
5748	Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?	0
5749	I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .	0
5750	Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?	0
5751	I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .	0
5752	Did you go to the concert last weekend ?	0
5753	No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?	0
5754	Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .	4
5755	How much was the ticket ?	0
5756	I only paid two dollars for mine .	0
5757	Mary and Tom are breaking up .	0
5758	It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?	6
5759	Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .	0
5760	Do you think they'll become reconciled ?	0
5761	No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .	0
5762	What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .	0
5763	have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?	0
5764	sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .	0
5765	as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?	0
5766	to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .	0
5767	but you look quite proficient in using them now .	0
5768	certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch	0
5769	yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i	0
5770	anything strang about that ?	0
5771	maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .	0
5772	oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .	0
5773	It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .	1
5774	Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .	0
5775	I can't forget it .	0
5776	You'd better cool yourself down first .	0
5777	Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .	0
5778	How many credits for each course ?	0
5779	Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .	0
5780	Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .	0
5781	I hate to go outside .	2
5782	Me too .	2
5783	Why do you hate to go outside ?	0
5784	I meet too many jerks .	2
5785	I agree .	2
5786	This city is full of jerks .	2
5787	Rude people are everywhere .	2
5788	But what can you do ?	0
5789	You can yell at them .	2
5790	And they will yell back at you .	2
5791	Yelling doesn't do any good .	0
5792	No . The best thing to do is just stay home .	0
5793	I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .	0
5794	You mean you suspect him .	0
5795	I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling .	0
5796	I hope I can do something for you .	0
5797	Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .	4
5798	You do ?	0
5799	Yeah , those classics from the great writers .	0
5800	But I find Japanese ones better .	0
5801	Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .	0
5802	Why doesn't he ask her ?	0
5803	He is too scared to ask her .	0
5804	He's a chicken guy .	0
5805	Good morning .	0
5806	Good morning .	0
5807	What does the paper say ?	0
5808	Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual .	0
5809	Well , what ’ s the weather report ?	0
5810	Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .	0
5811	Did they find those bank robbers ?	0
5812	Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all .	0
5813	What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ?	0
5814	Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself .	0
5815	I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days .	0
5816	It really depends on when and how long	0
5817	Until next weekend . that ’ s ok .	0
5818	They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday .	0
5819	But Saturday is my birthday .	0
5820	I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .	0
5821	But it won ’ t be on my birthday .	0
5822	But your health is more important . Believe me !	0
5823	I hate computer games .	2
5824	Why ? They are fine .	0
5825	Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .	2
5826	Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .	0
5827	If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .	2
5828	Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .	0
5829	Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ?	0
5830	Yes , I am . What's up ?	0
5831	Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?	4
5832	With pleasure . I suppose you dance often .	4
5833	Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .	4
5834	But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .	4
5835	Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?	4
5836	No . Just occasionally .	0
5837	What's your favorite dance ?	0
5838	It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz .	0
5839	How about rock'n'roll ?	0
5840	To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy .	0
5841	And the tango ?	0
5842	Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well .	0
5843	Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?	4
5844	OK .	4
5845	Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then .	4
5846	You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .	4
5847	Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .	4
5848	Do you have many friends ?	4
5849	Yes , I like to make new friends .	4
5850	What do you usually do with them ?	4
5851	We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .	4
5852	Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ?	0
5853	Don't feel like it . I'm broke .	0
5854	Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?	0
5855	Just look around ? Nah , that ’ s boring .	0
5856	I'll go by myself then .	0
5857	I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .	0
5858	Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .	4
5859	How about the new bar across the road ?	4
5860	Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .	4
5861	I agree , I had lunch there last week .	4
5862	Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .	4
5863	Hello , are you Chinese ?	0
5864	No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ?	0
5865	I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?	0
5866	I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ?	0
5867	I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .	0
5868	What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?	0
5869	I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .	0
5870	I can't agree more .	0
5871	Why don't you watch where you're going ?	1
5872	Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !	0
5873	There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .	1
5874	Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .	0
5875	I think my arm is broken .	0
5876	Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .	0
5877	Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .	0
5878	Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .	0
5879	I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?	0
5880	Alright .	0
5881	It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .	1
5882	Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .	0
5883	Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .	1
5884	Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .	0
5885	It really hurts .	1
5886	Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?	0
5887	To hell with you . The accident was your fault .	1
5888	I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?	0
5889	To hell with you .	1
5890	Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?	0
5891	Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?	0
5892	Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .	0
5893	That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .	4
5894	I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .	0
5895	Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .	4
5896	The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .	0
5897	And ?	0
5898	And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .	0
5899	Poor child !	0
5900	Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?	0
5901	What's your excuse this time ?	0
5902	Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?	0
5903	Yes , twice last week .	0
5904	Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .	0
5905	I don't think so . But it could've been .	0
5906	Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .	0
5907	I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?	2
5908	I'll do my best .	0
5909	Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .	0
5910	I'm working on it . Really !	0
5911	Hi , Becky , what's up ?	0
5912	Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .	0
5913	What's the problem ?	0
5914	She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .	0
5915	For example ?	0
5916	Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .	0
5917	No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .	0
5918	It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .	0
5919	My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .	0
5920	Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town .	4
5921	Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight .	4

5943	What is life ?	0
5944	Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart .	0
5945	Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .	0
5946	Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?	0
5947	Right .	0
5948	David , I ’ m going to China .	0
5949	Really ? How did you get the chance ?	6

5956	Thank you , David .	4
5957	Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !	4
5958	Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .	4
5959	Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .	4
5960	He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .	4
5961	Me too .	4
5962	Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .	4
5963	Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?	4
5964	Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .	4
5965	He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .	4
5966	And the host announced that he won it all !	4
5967	Come in , come in !	0
5968	Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ?	0
5969	I thought we were supposed to meet here .	0
5970	Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment .	0
5971	I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .	0
5972	Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?	0
5973	You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .	0
5974	It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .	0
5975	Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?	0
5976	It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .	0

5993	We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .	0
5994	When is it ?	0
5995	It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .	0
5996	Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?	0
5997	OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .	0
5998	Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?	0
5999	In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .	0
6000	It sounds so moving .	4
6001	Nice to see you , Patrick .	4
6002	Bob ! I hear your team won the match .	4
6003	Yeah . All of us tried our best .	4
6004	Congratulations !	4
6005	I think you're being a little naive .	0
6006	If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item .	0
6007	That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .	0
6008	eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .	0
6009	$ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ...	0
6010	Your knowledge of English is really surprising .	4
6011	Oh , it's nothing to speak of .	4
6012	No , seriously . I am impressed .	4
6013	Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .	4

6018	What did you watch ?	0
6019	I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .	0
6020	I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .	0
6021	If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .	0
6022	Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?	0
6023	How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .	0
6024	Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .	0
6025	Hurry , ok . It's dark out .	0

6029	sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .	0
6030	oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?	0
6031	I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .	0
6032	what do you usually write about ?	0
6033	at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an	0
6034	that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?	0
6035	it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .	0
6036	got it . Are you still updating your blog ?	0
6037	sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .	0
6038	good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .	0
6039	Have you found a new job yet ?	0
6040	No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .	0
6041	What kind of work ?	0
6042	I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company .	0
6043	What do you do there ?	0
6044	Mostly office work - filing and so on .	0
6045	How long is the assignment ?	0
6046	Till the end of the month .	0
6047	This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .	4
6048	En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .	4
6049	I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago .	0
6050	But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...	5
6051	I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .	0
6052	This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .	5
6053	I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .	0
6054	The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .	5
6055	I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .	2
6056	He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon .	0
6057	I prefer potatoes to eggplants .	0
6058	I feel eggplants are more nutritious .	0
6059	But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .	0
6060	Oh , that's how you see it .	0
6061	That way they look longer .	0
6062	Now what are you doing ?	0
6063	Putting on mascara .	0
6064	Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .	2
6065	I won't .	0
6066	And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .	0
6067	Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?	0
6068	Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?	0
6069	Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .	0
6070	I have a great idea of where you might like to go .	0
6071	Can we walk there ?	0
6072	It's on the second floor . May I join you ?	0
6073	Of course ! Let's go .	0
6074	Let's hurry . I'm starving !	0
6075	What are you going to do next year ?	4
6076	I want to go traveling .	4
6077	Do you have any where in mind ?	4
6078	Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .	4
6079	Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all .	0
6080	Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago .	0
6081	Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .	0
6082	But he still does not come back .	0
6083	Maybe he is on the way home now .	0
6084	How long have you been in England ?	0
6085	For almost two years .	0
6086	Almost two years ? Your English is very good .	4
6087	Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .	4
6088	The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?	0
6089	Johnson ? I can't place them .	0
6090	We met them in Bermuda last May .	0
6091	They've completely slipped my mind .	0
6092	The couple with the dogs , think back .	0
6093	No , I don't recall a thing about them .	0
6094	Well , I've invited them for brunch .	0
6095	Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded .	0
6096	His grandfather is the richest person in the area .	0
6097	What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .	0
6098	His grandfather's money is not his .	0
6099	I can't understand him anyway .	0
6100	What did he say ?	0
6101	He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .	0
6102	It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .	4
6103	Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .	4
6104	I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is .	0
6105	hey , Isabelle ...	0
6106	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .	1
6107	yes , I am the guy ...	0
6108	what a bummer ! You set me up ?	1
6109	let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...	0
6110	We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ?	4
6111	Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .	0
6112	Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !	4
6113	All right , just a quick one .	4
6114	Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?	0
6115	Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .	0
6116	Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .	0
6117	OK . Then tell me what else you know .	0
6118	Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?	0
6119	He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?	0
6120	Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '	0
6121	Indeed you know much about him .	0
6122	This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .	0
6123	I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me .	5
6124	Oh , that's all right .	0
6125	I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .	5
6126	No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .	0

6128	Yes , what's it ?	0
6129	What does mph stand for ?	0
6130	It's miles per hour .	0

6132	Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?	6
6133	' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .	0
6134	Then we'd better not go .	0
6135	OK .	0
6136	Are you ready to go shopping ?	0
6137	Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .	0
6138	What research ?	0
6139	Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?	0
6140	But they're just ads .	0
6141	Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .	0
6142	Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?	0
6143	I think there ’ s a Western on .	0
6144	Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it .	0
6145	Well , I really wanted to see the football game .	0
6146	Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?	0
6147	I believe there ’ s a sitcom .	0
6148	Are you interested in watching it ?	0
6149	Let me look in the TV Guide first .	0
6150	Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?	0
6151	If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .	0
6152	Do you want to watch it ?	0
6153	Let's watch it together .	0
6154	Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?	0
6155	It was funny .	4
6156	Tell me about it , will you ?	0
6157	Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .	4
6158	Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?	0
6159	Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .	4
6160	You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?	4
6161	We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .	4
6162	So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .	4
6163	Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .	4
6164	Susan is going to get a divorce .	0
6165	How do you know that ?	0
6166	She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .	0
6167	Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .	0
6168	Here's the course description guide .	0
6169	What do I do with it ?	0
6170	Do you want me to help you ?	0
6171	Please .	0
6172	Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .	0
6173	So I don't have to worry about them .	0
6174	You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...	0
6175	I'll take home economics .	0
6176	Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .	0
6177	Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .	0
6178	But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .	0
6179	What do you mean ?	0
6180	They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .	0
6181	That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .	0
6182	Ann , do you have time next Monday ?	0
6183	Yeah , what ’ s up ?	0
6184	Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .	4
6185	Wow . I'd love to .	4
6186	Great !	4
6187	When and where ?	4
6188	Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?	4
6189	Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation .	4
6190	I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .	4
6191	See you .	4
6192	Hey Stacy . What's going on ?	0
6193	I'm pretty tired these days .	0
6194	Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?	0
6195	I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .	0
6196	How about your husband . Does he help much ?	0
6197	Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?	0
6198	That sucks .	0
6199	If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?	0
6200	That's crossing the line .	1
6201	Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?	0
6202	Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?	0
6203	Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?	0
6204	Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .	0
6205	That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .	0
6206	Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?	0
6207	When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .	0
6208	I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?	0
6209	Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .	0
6210	Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .	0
6211	Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .	0
6212	You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .	0
6213	How do you arrange this summer vacation ?	0
6214	I want to travel .	0
6215	Where would you like to go ?	0
6216	The seaside .	4
6217	That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .	4
6218	I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .	4
6219	Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .	4
6220	Thank you !	4
6221	Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?	4
6222	No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now .	4
6223	Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .	4
6224	I'm dreadfully sorry for you .	0
6225	Thank you very much for your kindness .	4
6226	Is there any clue ?	0
6227	No , he left nothing .	0
6228	Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .	4
6229	Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there .	0
6230	That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .	4
6231	I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .	4
6232	And English is very useful in your job .	4
6233	I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .	4
6234	You will be a very promising one .	4
6235	That ’ s my wish .	4
6236	I hear you are expecting your family .	0
6237	Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .	0
6238	I didn't know you had a brother .	6
6239	Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .	0
6240	Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?	4
6241	His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .	0
6242	Does your brother have just one son ?	0
6243	No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .	0
6244	I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .	0
6245	Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .	0
6246	So when are they all coming ?	0
6247	My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .	0
6248	You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?	0
6249	I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .	0
6250	Where did you spend your holiday ?	0
6251	I went to Paris .	0
6252	So , Paula , where are you from ?	0
6253	I'm from Canada , originally .	0
6254	From Canada ? Where were you born ?	0
6255	Montreal .	0
6256	When did you come to Los Angeles ?	0
6257	We moved here when I was fourteen .	0
6258	Did you go to school here ?	0
6259	Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .	0
6260	Did you get a job right after graduation ?	0
6261	No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .	0
6262	When was that ?	0
6263	Let's see ... That was about six years ago .	0
6264	I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?	0
6265	I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?	0
6266	Do you consider yourself a good mother ?	0
6267	Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .	4
6268	How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .	0
6269	I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .	4
6270	Does your husband feel the same ?	0
6271	Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .	4
6272	I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .	0
6273	let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .	0
6274	I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .	0
6275	you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .	0
6276	I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .	0
6277	we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .	0
6278	that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?	0
6279	that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .	0
6280	I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .	0
6281	the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how .	0
6282	What's his job ?	0
6283	He used to be a policeman .	0
6284	But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .	0
6285	Yeah . He's a private eye now .	0
6286	Bother the flies !	0
6287	Where do they come from ?	0
6288	I don't know . Something rotten here ?	0
6289	I can't see it .	0
6290	Have you got your invitation yet ?	0
6291	My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?	6
6292	The house warming party .	0
6293	Whose house warming party is it ?	0
6294	Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .	0
6295	Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .	0
6296	It's out in the suburbs .	0
6297	Have you seen the house ?	0
6298	Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .	0
6299	Is it nice ?	4
6300	Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .	4
6301	There's also a garden .	4
6302	Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?	4
6303	They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .	4
6304	When are they going to have the party ?	4
6305	Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .	4
6306	Wow , that would be something to look forward to .	4
6307	hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?	0
6308	I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .	0
6309	oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?	0
6310	we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec	0
6311	wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !	4
6312	tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?	0
6313	perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .	0
6314	no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .	0
6315	we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .	0
6316	great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .	4
6317	no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .	4
6318	Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .	4
6319	Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink .	0
6320	Sounds good . Where are we going ?	0
6321	Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .	0
6322	Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?	0
6323	Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !	0
6324	Whew ! That getup is terrific !	0
6325	Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful !	0
6326	That too .	0
6327	I'm gonna introduce myself .	0
6328	If you're lucky , that might do the trick .	0
6329	Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .	0
6330	Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?	0
6331	My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .	0
6332	I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .	0
6333	OK , catch you later .	0
6334	Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !	4
6335	Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair !	4
6336	Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !	4
6337	Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !	4
6338	Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .	4
6339	He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !	4
6340	Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .	4
6341	Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .	4
6342	Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !	4
6343	But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .	4
6344	Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !	4
6345	That would be great ! Give me a call !	4
6346	See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .	4
6347	Did you already take the history exam ?	0
6348	Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?	0
6349	I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?	0
6350	Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .	0
6351	What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?	0
6352	I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .	0
6353	Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .	0
6354	If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .	0
6355	Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .	0
6356	Good luck .	4
6357	Thanks . See ya .	4
6358	What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .	0
6359	It's us .	0
6360	"What do you mean by "" us "" ?"	0
6361	Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?	0
6362	What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?	0
6363	Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .	0
6364	Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?	0
6365	Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?	0
6366	Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?	4
6367	Yes.Do you like it ?	4
6368	It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .	4
6369	Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .	6
6370	Is classical music your favorite ?	4
6371	Yes . What about you ?	4
6372	I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .	0
6373	Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .	0
6374	Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .	0
6375	Did you always like pop music .	0
6376	I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .	0
6377	I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .	0
6378	oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .	6
6379	Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .	0
6380	It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .	0
6381	Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?	0
6382	Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .	0
6383	Fortunately , things are changing these years .	0
6384	Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .	0
6385	A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?	0
6386	There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .	0
6387	I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .	0
6388	What about sunday ?	0
6389	i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .	0
6390	Maybe next week .	0
6391	Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .	0
6392	Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .	0
6393	I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .	0
6394	Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?	0
6395	Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .	0
6396	Oh , do you go hiking often ?	0
6397	I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .	4
6398	It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?	4
6399	Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?	4
6400	Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .	4
6401	Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .	4
6402	Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .	4
6403	Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend .	4
6404	Thanks , I ’ ll ask him .	0
6405	How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !	5
6406	I don't know if anything terrible has happened .	5
6407	I have reported it to the police .	0
6408	We'd better prepare for the worst .	0
6409	You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?	0
6410	He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?	0
6411	I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .	0
6412	I can think of better things to dream about ...	0
6413	Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .	0
6414	That's crazy .	0
6415	Mike ! Look at the floor !	6
6416	What's wrong with it ?	0
6417	What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !	0
6418	Oh ...	0
6419	It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .	0
6420	Sorry , love .	0
6421	What are you looking for now ?	0
6422	My cigarettes .	0
6423	Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .	0
6424	In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?	0
6425	Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?	0
6426	Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .	0
6427	It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .	0
6428	Are you Chinese by birth ?	0
6429	Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .	0
6430	How do you like it ?	0
6431	I like it so far . But my English still needs work .	0
6432	I want to study Mandarin and public relations .	0
6433	Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .	4
6434	Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .	4
6435	Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .	0
6436	Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .	0
6437	You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?	0
6438	They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .	0
6439	Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?	4
6440	Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .	0
6441	Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?	0
6442	It's possible .	0
6443	You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .	4
6444	Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !	6
6445	Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !	4
6446	How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?	4
6447	Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !	4
6448	Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !	4
6449	The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .	4
6450	What are we waiting for ? Let's go !	4
6451	Let ’ s play a game !	0
6452	OK ! How about Scrabble ?	0
6453	No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !	0
6454	OK !	0
6455	Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !	0
6456	Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !	0
6457	Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !	0
6458	Your future husband !	0
6459	Not funny .	0
6460	As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .	0
6461	It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .	0
6462	Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .	0
6463	For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .	0
6464	That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .	0
6465	Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .	0
6466	Lee , I'm going to get married next month .	4
6467	Good news ! And congratulations !	4
6468	You are invited to my wedding .	4
6469	Thank you . I'll certainly be there .	4
6470	Thank you for lending me the book .	0
6471	Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .	0
6472	But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .	0
6473	Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?	0
6474	I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .	0
6475	Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?	0
6476	Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .	0
6477	The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?	0
6478	Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .	0
6479	That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?	0
6480	It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?	0
6481	Yeah . I think I can find it .	0
6482	You're back already . That sure was quick .	0
6483	That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .	0
6484	Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .	0
6485	Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .	4
6486	Okay , let's go !	4
6487	hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?	0
6488	well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .	0
6489	what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .	4
6490	oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?	6
6491	actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?	0
6492	art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .	0
6493	really impressive . These two genres are totally different .	0
6494	sure . I enjoy both of them very much .	0
6495	how often do you go to the cinema ?	0
6496	once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .	0
6497	movie salon ? where is that ?	0
6498	it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .	0
6499	is it good ?	0
6500	yes , you can find almost all new releases there .	0
6501	really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .	0
6502	why not ?	0
6503	Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !	4
6504	Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .	6
6505	Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .	4
6506	That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?	4
6507	Three months .	0
6508	Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?	0
6509	I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .	0
6510	Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .	4
6511	I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .	0
6512	There are so many things you have to prepare for .	0
6513	I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .	0
6514	It really must be an exciting time for you guys .	4
6515	Thank you so much .	4
6516	Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ?	0
6517	She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work .	0
6518	Poor girl !	0
6519	Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .	0
6520	Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?	6
6521	That's what I'm wondering , too .	0
6522	I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .	0
6523	Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?	4
6524	Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .	0
6525	We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?	4
6526	Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .	0
6527	What a pity ! You can't join us .	5
6528	So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .	4
6529	I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?	4
6530	Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .	4
6531	Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?	0
6532	I prefer sea food .	0
6533	ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .	0
6534	That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .	0
6535	See you later .	0
6536	bye .	0
6537	Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .	5
6538	If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop .	0
6539	I did . But they said they won ’ t change them .	5
6540	That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do .	0
6541	Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?	0
6542	Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .	0
6543	Totally agree . What is your solution ?	0
6544	Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .	0
6545	You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .	0
6546	It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .	0
6547	But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .	0
6548	I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .	0
6549	I am so busy today .	0
6550	Can I help you ?	4
6551	I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .	0
6552	I ’ ll be glad to help .	4
6553	Or maybe make the beds .	0
6554	All you have to do is ask for help .	4
6555	Thanks . That ’ s terrific !	4
6556	I ’ m ready and willing to help .	4
6557	The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .	0
6558	Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?	4
6559	Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .	4
6560	Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?	0
6561	I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .	0
6562	You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .	0
6563	You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .	0
6564	I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .	0
6565	Do you feel ok ?	0
6566	Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .	0
6567	Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .	0
6568	Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?	0
6569	You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .	0
6570	Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .	0
6571	Zach , what's that on your arm ?	0
6572	I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .	0
6573	It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?	0
6574	Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .	0
6575	I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .	0
6576	Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?	0
6577	We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .	0
6578	Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !	0
6579	I can't go to your party .	0
6580	That's too bad .	0
6581	Do you like being a doctor ?	0
6582	Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .	0
6583	Can you tell me about it ?	0
6584	You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .	0
6585	What can you do when this happens ?	0
6586	Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .	0
6587	Have you eaten ?	0
6588	Not yet .	0
6589	It's too hot to read .	0
6590	We'd better go out for a walk .	0
6591	Which season do you like best ?	0
6592	Spring .	0
6593	How about summer ?	0
6594	I dislike it most .	2
6595	Why ?	0
6596	Because the hottest season is summer in a year .	0
6597	But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .	0
6598	My son came home from three years in the navy .	0
6599	It was a real red letter day for you .	0
6600	Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .	0
6601	John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?	0
6602	Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?	4
6603	It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .	6
6604	You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?	4
6605	I must be going .	0
6606	Okay . Keep in touch .	0
6607	Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .	0
6608	I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .	0
6609	I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?	0
6610	Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .	0
6611	But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .	1
6612	I know why we have reservations .	0
6613	I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .	1
6614	But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like .	0
6615	Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .	1
6616	Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?	0
6617	Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .	1
6618	Do you think Tom will be elected president ?	0
6619	No , I think Harry will get it .	0
6620	Let's make a bet on who gets it .	0
6621	OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .	0
6622	I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .	0
6623	Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .	0
6624	You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?	0
6625	To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .	0
6626	But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .	0
6627	What happened ? Why didn't he win ?	0
6628	Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .	0
6629	How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !	6
6630	If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .	0
6631	What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?	6
6632	He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	0
6633	I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	2
6634	They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	2
6635	That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	2
6636	I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	2
6637	Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	0
6638	I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	0
6639	Let's hope so .	0
6640	Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?	0
6641	That's because Americans love sitcoms .	0
6642	Sitcoms ?	0
6643	Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .	0
6644	In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .	0
6645	I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .	0
6646	Are you interested in history ?	0
6647	Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .	4
6648	I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .	4
6649	I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !	0
6650	Some people say that history repeats itself .	0
6651	What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?	0
6652	The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .	0
6653	I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .	0
6654	You're looking great .	4
6655	You , too .	4
6656	What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .	0
6657	You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .	0
6658	Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .	0
6659	It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .	0
6660	Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?	0
6661	Yes , they say I would get a big sum .	0
6662	Have you discussed it with your wife ?	0
6663	Yes , she leaves it to me .	0
6664	As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .	0
6665	I have to think about it .	0
6666	Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?	0
6667	Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .	0
6668	Of course .	0
6669	I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .	0
6670	That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics .	0
6671	I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?	0
6672	I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .	0
6673	What do you think our chance are in other events .	0
6674	In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events .	0
6675	We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .	0
6676	I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .	0
6677	You are very optimistic !	0
6678	Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .	4
6679	I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .	0
6680	Well , drop by if you can .	0
6681	I will , do you want me to bring anything ?	0
6682	No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .	4
6683	It's said that John's broken up .	0
6684	Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .	6
6685	I hear that John's leading a double wife .	0
6686	It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .	2
6687	Let's play chess .	0
6688	I haven't played chess for a long time .	0
6689	That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .	0
6690	Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .	0
6691	You're a very good player	0
6692	Not really , but once I won a prize .	0
6693	So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .	0
6694	My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .	0
6695	You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?	0
6696	Yeah , about .	0
6697	Do you know Chinese better now ?	0
6698	Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .	0
6699	Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .	0
6700	I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .	0
6701	A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .	0
6702	I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .	0
6703	Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .	0
6704	Yes , absolutely true .	0
6705	Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?	0
6706	Harry Potter .	0
6707	Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?	0
6708	Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .	0
6709	Got it .	0
6710	Have you ever read this book before ?	0
6711	No , but my little brother likes it very much .	0
6712	It's really a good book . You will like it too .	0
6713	I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .	0
6714	Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?	0
6715	Jane Austen .	0
6716	Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .	0
6717	I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .	0
6718	Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .	0
6719	Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .	4
6720	I guess we'll see just around .	0
6721	Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy .	0
6722	You too .	0
6723	Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !	0
6724	I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !	1
6725	But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !	0
6726	Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !	1
6727	What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?	0
6728	Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !	1
6729	So he talks about you behind your back ?	0
6730	Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !	1
6731	I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .	0
6732	I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .	0
6733	My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .	0
6734	Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !	3
6735	What is it ? What happened ?	0
6736	I think someone is stalking me .	3
6737	No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?	6
6738	I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .	3
6739	What did you do ?	0
6740	I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .	3
6741	Did he leave when you left ?	0
6742	Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .	3
6743	What did you do ?	0
6744	Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?	0
6745	Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?	0
6746	Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .	0
6747	Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .	0
6748	Is it close by ?	0
6749	It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?	0
6750	OK , I'd love the company .	4
6751	This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .	4
6752	have you ever been to Disneyworld ?	0
6753	when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?	0
6754	the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .	0
6755	that's right . Why do you ask ?	0
6756	well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .	0
6757	when are you getting married ?	0
6758	some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .	0
6759	congratulations ! I had no idea .	0
6760	thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?	0
6761	do you like amusement parks ?	0
6762	for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .	0
6763	if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .	0
6764	even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?	0
6765	even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .	4
6766	thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .	0
6767	I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !	4
6768	Matthew ? Hi !	4
6769	Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?	4
6770	It's got to be almost a year now .	4
6771	How have you been ?	4
6772	I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .	4
6773	Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?	0
6774	Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .	0
6775	Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?	4
6776	Mrs . Thou ?	0
6777	Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .	4
6778	Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !	4
6779	I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?	4
6780	Are you ready to go to the mall ?	0
6781	Yeah . Dig my new pants ?	0
6782	Copycat !	1
6783	What do you mean ?	0
6784	You went out and bought khakis , too !	1
6785	No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .	0
6786	Whatever .	0
6787	Have heard of Paul ?	0
6788	No , what ?	0
6789	He's got a promotion .	0
6790	You're kidding .	6
6791	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	0
6792	I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years .	0
6793	Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .	0
6794	Well.Good for him .	0
6795	Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?	0
6796	I think the supermarket is closed now .	0
6797	Oh , When does it close ?	0
6798	It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .	0
6799	That's too bad .	0
6800	Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .	0
6801	Alright . What do you want to do now ?	4
6802	Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .	4
6803	Where does she live ?	0
6804	She lives in San Francisco .	0
6805	How long has she lived there ?	0
6806	I think she's lived there for about 10 years .	0
6807	That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?	0
6808	San Diego .	0
6809	Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?	0
6810	No . How about you ?	0
6811	Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .	0
6812	Who's that ?	0
6813	Search me .	0
6814	I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .	0
6815	What did you argue about ?	0
6816	He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .	0
6817	Well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair .	0
6818	Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .	0
6819	Did you lend him a lot of money ?	0
6820	Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .	0
6821	Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?	0
6822	No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .	0
6823	Of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?	0
6824	Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .	0
6825	I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .	0
6826	Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .	0
6827	No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .	0
6828	Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?	4
6829	Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .	4
6830	They must be amazing animals .	4
6831	They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .	4
6832	I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .	4
6833	They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .	4
6834	Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .	0
6835	I am not surprised , you eat too much .	0
6836	And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .	0
6837	No , I wouldn't think so .	0
6838	I do wish I could lose weight .	0
6839	Well , why don't you go on the diet ?	0
6840	I've tried diets before but they've never worked .	0
6841	Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .	0
6842	Yes , maybe I should .	0
6843	Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets	0
6844	All right .	0
6845	Here is your ticket .	0
6846	Thank you .	0
6847	The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .	0
6848	Really ?	6
6849	Yes , let's go in .	0
6850	It is a new park , isn't it ?	0
6851	Yes , how do you know ?	0
6852	I guessed it .	0
6853	Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .	0
6854	Oh , how wonderful !	4
6855	I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .	0
6856	I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .	0
6857	The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .	0
6858	Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .	0
6859	Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .	0
6860	Can you ride a horse ?	0
6861	Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?	0
6862	I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?	4
6863	What a good idea !	4
6864	Where's Mrs . Johnson ?	0
6865	Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner .	0
6866	I see . Can I sit down ?	0
6867	Of course ! Make yourself at home .	0
6868	Thank you , Mr . Johnson .	0
6869	Please , just call me Tom .	0
6870	Okay , Tom .	0
6871	Where's Cindy ?	0
6872	She's upstairs in my room .	0
6873	Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner .	0
6874	Have you heard of Paul ?	0
6875	No , what ?	0
6876	He's got a promotion .	0
6877	You're kidding .	6
6878	No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	0
6879	Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .	6
6880	Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .	0
6881	Well . Good for him .	0
6882	Let's speed up . We're going to be late again .	0
6883	If we hurry , can we get there in time ?	0
6884	I hope so .	0
6885	Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?	0

6902	The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .	0
6903	It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .	0
6904	Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .	0
6905	That's true .	0
6906	I ’ m forming a music band .	0
6907	Do you already know how to play an instrument ?	0
6908	Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .	0
6909	Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?	0
6910	We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?	0

6912	Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .	4
6913	Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?	4

6915	I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .	0
6916	Have you asked Santa ?	0
6917	Yes and I've written him a letter .	0
6918	Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !	0
6919	George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .	0
6920	Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .	0
6921	Where will we sleep , then ?	0
6922	In the van .	0
6923	What about other expenses ?	0
6924	Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?	0
6925	Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ?	0
6926	The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !	4
6927	Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet .	0
6928	As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .	0
6929	Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !	4
6930	You have such good ideas !	4
6931	What date will our field trip be on ?	0
6932	The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?	0
6933	Yes , I will make note of that .	0
6934	Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7	0
6935	I will be there half an hour early .	0

6937	Yes , someone is picking me up .	0
6938	To get back to campus by 8	0
6939	Not at the moment — maybe later , though .	0

6941	The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .	0
6942	I'm sorry for hero .	0
6943	I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .	0
6944	Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .	0
6945	How was your business trip ?	0
6946	Great - they wined and dined us all week .	4
6947	Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?	0
6948	My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?	0
6949	Two years or so .	0
6950	That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?	0
6951	No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .	0
6952	Do you enjoy work here ?	0
6953	It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .	0
6954	Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .	0
6955	Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .	4
6956	Glad to hear that .	4
6957	Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .	4
6958	What's the second solar system ?	0
6959	It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .	4
6960	Is this good news or bad news ?	0
6961	It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !	4
6962	You mean with people on it ?	0
6963	Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?	4
6964	Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?	0
6965	Sorry , I thought you knew .	0
6966	But you should tell me you were in love with her .	0
6967	Didn't I ?	6
6968	You know you didn't .	0
6969	Well , I am telling you now .	0
6970	Yes , but you might have told me before .	0
6971	I didn't think you would be interested .	0
6972	You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?	1
6973	Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .	0
6974	Oh , you men ! You are all the same .	1
6975	How was the movie last night ?	0
6976	I didn't really like it .	2
6977	Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .	0
6978	I found it very disappointing .	2
6979	She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .	0
6980	I wasn't happy with it .	2
6981	Nothing is to your satisfaction .	0
6982	Honey , I ’ ll be right back !	0
6983	Where are you going ?	0
6984	I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .	0
6985	Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?	0
6986	Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !	0
6987	Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that !	0
6988	They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !	0
6989	Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .	0
6990	Good afternoon !	4
6991	Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?	4
6992	I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?	4
6993	Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?	4
6994	Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .	4
6995	Yes .	0
6996	What's the weather like in your country ?	0
6997	Mm ... It's quite warm now .	0
6998	Where do you live ?	0
6999	In London.Where do you live ?	0
7000	Here.Near this school .	0
7001	I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !	0
7002	So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?	0
7003	That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !	0
7004	Have you ever written up a business plan before ?	0
7005	Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?	0
7006	You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .	0
7007	Well , that seems easy enough .	0
7008	Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .	0
7009	Geez . Is that all ?	0
7010	Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !	0
7011	Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !	0
7012	I hear that Mary got mad .	0
7013	So I heard .	0
7014	What ’ s wrong with her ?	0
7015	She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .	0
7016	Um , what will you do this weekend ?	0
7017	How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .	4
7018	A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?	0
7019	No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?	4
7020	Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .	4
7021	What ’ s on TV tonight ?	0
7022	Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .	0
7023	Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .	0
7024	Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show .	0
7025	No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .	0
7026	Yeah , if you ’ re a girl .	0
7027	Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .	0
7028	That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .	0
7029	It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .	0
7030	O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too .	0
7031	No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game .	0
7032	It ’ s really terrible !	0
7033	What are you talking about ?	0
7034	Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .	0
7035	You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .	0
7036	Sarah , what did you do today ?	0
7037	I went shopping .	0
7038	Did you buy anything ?	0
7039	Yes , I bought a few things .	0
7040	What did you buy ?	0
7041	I bought this coat . Do you like it ?	0
7042	Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?	4
7043	At the mall on 5th street .	0
7044	Was it expensive ?	0
7045	No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .	0
7046	That's cheap .	0
7047	I know . It was a really good deal .	4
7048	I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .	0
7049	Hi , Victor . How are you ?	0
7050	Oh , I'm fine .	0
7051	So , are you going to go to class tonight ?	0
7052	Maybe ... but I don't think so .	5
7053	Really ? What's the matter ?	6
7054	I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .	5
7055	Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .	4
7056	Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .	4
7057	How's John doing ?	0
7058	He can barely make ends meet .	0
7059	The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .	0
7060	They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .	0
7061	If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .	0
7062	No way , if it still has 21 .	0
7063	What's that book you have under your arm ?	0
7064	It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .	0
7065	How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .	0
7066	I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .	0
7067	Is it really worth paying for ?	0
7068	I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .	0
7069	If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .	0
7070	Come on , you are left behind !	0
7071	Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .	0
7072	You just need more exercise .	0
7073	Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !	0
7074	I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .	0
7075	But running so fast is not good for people over forties .	0
7076	Why ?	0
7077	We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .	0
7078	But I want to burn up more calories !	0
7079	In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .	0
7080	Really ? I will slow down then .	6
7081	Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?	0
7082	Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?	0
7083	I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .	0
7084	Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .	0
7085	Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .	0
7086	It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .	4
7087	But it's really exciting .	4
7088	Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .	0
7089	Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .	0
7090	Yep .	0
7091	I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .	0
7092	Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .	0
7093	It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .	0
7094	The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .	0
7095	Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .	0
7096	It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .	0
7097	Are you an art aficionado ?	0
7098	Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?	0
7099	I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .	0
7100	I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .	0
7101	Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .	0
7102	I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you .	0
7103	I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .	0
7104	That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?	4
7105	Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .	4
7106	What does your mother do , may I ask ?	0
7107	My mother works in a company as an accountant .	0
7108	Is she busy ?	0
7109	Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .	0
7110	Hello , Bessie .	4
7111	Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !	4
7112	My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .	6
7113	I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .	4
7114	Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .	4
7115	"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you ."	4
7116	Thank you very much .	4
7117	Nice day , isn't it ?	4
7118	It sure is .	4
7119	It's a good day for a picnic .	4
7120	Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?	0
7121	I don't want to .	1
7122	Well , come over and talk to me then .	0
7123	Certainly not .	1
7124	May I turn on the TV then ?	0
7125	Turn on the TV for what ?	1
7126	So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .	0
7127	Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?	1
7128	I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .	0
7129	To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .	2
7130	Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !	6
7131	Brian ! How have you been ?	4
7132	Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !	4
7133	Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .	4
7134	Well , you look great ! How are you ?	4
7135	I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .	4
7136	That's terrific !	4
7137	How is your new dormitory ?	0
7138	It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .	4
7139	Well , do you all major in the same subject ?	0
7140	No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .	0
7141	That's great !	4
7142	Peter , how often do you exercise ?	0
7143	Well , I swim and run every day .	0
7144	Now , tell me , what do you eat ?	0
7145	Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .	0
7146	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	0
7147	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .	0
7148	What do you drink ?	0
7149	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .	0
7150	What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?	0
7151	We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .	0
7152	How hard is the climb ?	0
7153	It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .	0
7154	What did you do last week ?	0
7155	We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .	0
7156	Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .	4
7157	Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .	4
7158	Yeah , I will . See you then !	4
7159	O . K . See you .	4
7160	How many languages can you speak ?	0
7161	I can speak French and German .	0
7162	How well can you speak them ?	0
7163	I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .	0
7164	Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?	0
7165	No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .	0
7166	Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?	2
7167	Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .	0
7168	It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .	2
7169	You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .	0
7170	Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !	2
7171	It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .	0
7172	Do you really have to work today ?	0
7173	Yes . I'm afraid so .	0
7174	But you'll miss out on the football game .	0
7175	Oh . Well , it can't be helped .	0
7176	How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !	4
7177	Oh , do you really think so ?	0
7178	Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .	4
7179	But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight .	0
7180	I had an accident .	0
7181	That's terrible !	0
7182	I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .	4
7183	You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .	4
7184	Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .	4
7185	Come on ! You're pulling my leg .	6
7186	Really ! Here's my trophy .	4
7187	Wow ! Congratulations !	4
7188	What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .	4
7189	Thank you .	4
7190	Is that your wedding ring ?	4
7191	I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .	4
7192	Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?	4
7193	In June .	4
7194	Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?	4
7195	Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .	4
7196	You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .	4
7197	Thank you so much .	4
7198	What kind of watch is it ?	0
7199	It's a Tag Heer .	0
7200	If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?	0
7201	This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .	0
7202	That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .	4
7203	Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .	4
7204	I'm really mad at Bob .	0
7205	What for ? ( Why ? )	0
7206	Hi , Jack , how have you been ?	0
7207	Not very well .	5
7208	Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?	0
7209	Nothing .	5
7210	Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .	0
7211	Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .	5
7212	Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .	0
7213	Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .	5
7214	Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .	0
7215	Maybe you're right .	5
7216	Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !	0
7217	Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...	5
7218	Do you know Sally ?	0
7219	Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .	0
7220	Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .	0
7221	Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .	0
7222	Excuse me . Do you have the time ?	0
7223	My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .	0
7224	Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?	0
7225	If we start now , we can make it by taxi .	0
7226	Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?	0
7227	Yeah .	0
7228	Who won ?	0
7229	China .	0
7230	What is the score ?	0
7231	China beat Brazil three to zero .	0
7232	Wonderful .	4
7233	What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .	0
7234	The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .	0
7235	Again ?	0
7236	At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .	0
7237	Ouch .	0
7238	Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .	0
7239	You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .	0
7240	I'm sorry . I won't do it again .	0
7241	Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .	0
7242	Is this the sign ? What does it says ?	0
7243	It says No smoking here .	0
7244	Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?	0
7245	Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?	0
7246	First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .	0
7247	That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .	4
7248	How do you research your books ?	4
7249	I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .	4
7250	I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !	4
7251	Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .	4
7252	Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?	4
7253	There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .	4
7254	Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time .	4
7255	What shall I call him ?	0
7256	Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .	0
7257	What's he doing ?	0
7258	He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs .	0
7259	For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .	4
7260	That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !	4
7261	I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .	4
7262	That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .	4
7263	Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .	4
7264	Will it be an all day event ?	0
7265	Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .	0
7266	That was quick thinking .	0
7267	I'm so glad I bought this watch !	4
7268	Cool ! Flashy red lines !	4
7269	I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .	4
7270	Is it waterproof ?	4
7271	Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .	4
7272	Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?	4
7273	Well , surfing , scuba diving ...	4
7274	Do you take a bus to and from work ?	0
7275	Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .	0
7276	Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .	0
7277	Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .	0
7278	That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .	0
7279	What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?	0
7280	You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !	0
7281	Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?	0
7282	Yeah , absolutely !	0
7283	And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .	0
7284	You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?	0
7285	What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy .	0
7286	We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .	4
7287	That's great .	4
7288	Now let's get things ready .	4
7289	Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .	4
7290	That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .	4
7291	Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .	4
7292	Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .	4
7293	And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .	4
7294	Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .	0
7295	There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .	0
7296	That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .	0
7297	Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .	0
7298	My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .	0
7299	OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .	0
7300	Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .	0
7301	It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .	0
7302	The boy is good for nothing .	0
7303	As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him .	0
7304	He is hopeless .	0
7305	Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?	0
7306	Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?	0
7307	Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?	0
7308	Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .	4
7309	Great , so what happens now ?	0
7310	Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .	4
7311	Do you believe in UFOs ?	0
7312	Of course , they are out there .	0
7313	But I never saw them .	0
7314	Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .	0
7315	You mean that you can them .	0
7316	That's right . I can see them in my dreams .	0
7317	They come to the earth ?	0
7318	No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .	0
7319	Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?	0
7320	OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .	0
7321	That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?	0
7322	Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .	0
7323	Wow . Sounds fantastic !	4
7324	You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?	4
7325	Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest .	4
7326	Really ? Congratulations !	4
7327	Thank you , Paul .	4
7328	By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .	0
7329	Good , happy birthday to you !	4
7330	Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?	0
7331	Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .	4
7332	My pleasure .	4
7333	Do you have a minute ?	0
7334	Sure . What's up ?	0
7335	Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?	0
7336	Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .	0
7337	May , I really regret watching it with you last night .	0
7338	Did it scare you ?	0
7339	Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .	0
7340	Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .	0
7341	Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .	0
7342	I like scary movies .	0
7343	That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !	0
7344	Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .	0
7345	Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .	0
7346	Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?	0
7347	Of course ! I can watch them without you !	0
7348	Oh , really ?	6
7349	What is your nationality ?	0
7350	I am Chinese by birth .	0
7351	Where is your domicile place ?	0

7357	You really are lucky !	4
7358	Yeah , I know .	4
7359	Say , what's your favorite sport ?	0

7361	Do you play much tennis ?	0
7362	Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?	0
7363	Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .	0

7381	Just like dear old London !	0
7382	They got a divorce at last .	0
7383	It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .	0
7384	You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .	0

7420	You received a letter in the mail .	0
7421	Give it here .	0
7422	Who ’ s the letter from ?	0
7423	I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU .	0
7424	I want to know what it says .	0
7425	They didn ’ t accept me .	0
7426	Are you serious ?	0
7427	It ’ s the truth .	0

7433	My girlfriend just broke up with me .	5
7434	You must feel terrible now .	0
7435	Yeah .	5
7436	I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .	0
7437	You've been through this too ?	6
7438	Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .	0
7439	But it hurts too much .	5
7440	I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .	0
7441	What if I don't want to find another girl ?	0
7442	You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .	0
7443	You're right .	4
7444	I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?	4
7445	Yeah . Thanks for the talk .	4
7446	I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .	4
7447	Ok . I'll talk to you later .	4

7452	13.50 ?	0
7453	Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go .	0
7454	I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock .	0
7455	Never mind about that .	0
7456	I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ?	0
7457	No , I won ’ t hear of it .	0
7458	A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again .	0
7459	Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?	0
7460	A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?	0
7461	Not bad , But she's as busy as before .	0
7462	Whatever we do , we should do it above board .	0
7463	You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .	0
7464	Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .	0
7465	Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !	4
7466	Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?	4
7467	Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .	4
7468	Can't Elvin handle it ?	0
7469	I think he's got too much on his plate .	0
7470	This is the best dinner I've ever had .	4
7471	How about the soup ?	4
7472	I've never tasted anything better .	4
7473	How nice of you to say so .	4
7474	Hey Nick , what are you up to ?	0
7475	Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?	0
7476	Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man .	0
7477	Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .	0
7478	Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !	4
7479	Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !	0
7480	Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !	0
7481	The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?	0
7482	Let ’ s do it !	0
7483	Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .	0
7484	I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back .	0

7488	Don't feel like it . I'm broke .	0
7489	Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?	0
7490	Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .	0
7491	I'll go myself then .	0
7492	What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .	0
7493	I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .	5
7494	come on , nothing can be that bad .	0
7495	but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .	0
7496	ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?	0
7497	I've fallen in love with my boss .	0
7498	really ? Is he married ?	6
7499	no , of course not . He is still single .	0
7500	then what's your problem ?	0
7501	I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .	5
7502	oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .	0
7503	worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .	5
7504	office romance is very tricky .	0
7505	it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .	5
7506	cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .	0
7507	You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?	0
7508	Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .	0

7510	With everything , with everybody , with all this !	0
7511	A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .	0
7512	It wasn't always like this , you know .	0
7513	What do you mean ?	0
7514	Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .	0
7515	You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .	0
7516	Certainly , perhaps .	0
7517	I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .	1
7518	Hey , Isabelle ...	0
7519	Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .	1
7520	Yes , I am the guy .	0
7521	What a bummer ! You set me up ?	1
7522	Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...	0
7523	How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )	1
7524	Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !	0
7525	Why did you lie to me in the email ?	1
7526	I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .	0
7527	I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .	1
7528	I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .	0
7529	Peter , how often do you exercise ?	0
7530	Well , I swim and run every day .	0

7533	Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	0
7534	Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .	4
7535	What do you drink ?	0
7536	Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .	0

7543	China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .	0
7544	Wonderful !	4
7545	Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .	0
7546	I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .	0
7547	Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .	0
7548	I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .	0
7549	It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .	0
7550	Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !	0
7551	Isn't it wonderful walking here ?	4
7552	What do you mean ?	0
7553	I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .	4
7554	Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .	4
7555	It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?	0
7556	You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .	0
7557	What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?	0
7558	Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .	0
7559	What's there after that ?	0
7560	Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .	0
7561	What are they all for ?	0
7562	Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .	0
7563	Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?	0
7564	I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .	0
7565	What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?	0
7566	Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .	0
7567	And your parents took it badly ?	0
7568	That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .	0
7569	Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?	0
7570	She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .	0
7571	How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?	0
7572	Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .	0
7573	Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .	6
7574	What do you mean ?	0
7575	Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .	0
7576	I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .	0
7577	Do you think they two will get married ?	4
7578	Yeah , you can count on it .	4
7579	I think so . Yes , they get along so well .	4
7580	I like him . He's good for her .	4
7581	You're right . He sure is .	4
7582	What do you think of Frank ?	0
7583	He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .	0
7584	Why do you say that ?	0
7585	Whatever things get tough , he gives in .	0
7586	Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .	0
7587	Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .	0
7588	I sure hope so .	0
7589	Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?	0
7590	Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .	0
7591	I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?	0
7592	Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .	0
7593	It must be interesting to study English .	0
7594	Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .	4
7595	Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?	0
7596	Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .	0
7597	It's quiet everywhere in winter .	0
7598	Yes . I like winter .	0
7599	Me too .	0
7600	It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?	4
7601	That's a good idea . Let's go !	4
7602	What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .	4
7603	Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .	4
7604	I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .	4
7605	Yes . Very wonderful .	4
7606	There is a snowman over there .	4
7607	How lovely it is !	4
7608	Tim's always bothering me .	0
7609	Just tell him off .	0
7610	Who are those guys ?	0
7611	Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players .	0
7612	Oh .	0
7613	Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !	6
7614	All right !	6
7615	Here comes Jordan , though .	4
7616	Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .	4
7617	Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .	4
7618	Which team do you think will win ?	4
7619	The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .	4
7620	I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .	0
7621	It's ok . What do you want to ask ?	0
7622	Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?	0
7623	The first place you should go is the International Center .	0
7624	Why ?	0
7625	You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .	0
7626	What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?	0
7627	They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .	0
7628	Can we get any more help at the International Center ?	0
7629	Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .	0
7630	I see . It must be worth going to .	0
7631	Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .	0
7632	Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .	4
7633	It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .	4
7634	hi , Lander . What's wrong ?	0
7635	I can hardly make ends meet these days .	0
7636	same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .	0
7637	my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .	0
7638	true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .	0
7639	definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .	0
7640	the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .	0
7641	is that inflation ?	0
7642	inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .	0
7643	has the government taken some measures to curb it ?	0
7644	yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .	0
7645	but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .	0
7646	you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .	0
7647	how ?	0
7648	for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .	0
7649	sounds a good idea .	4
7650	OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .	0
7651	You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .	0
7652	Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .	0
7653	You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .	0
7654	The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !	4
7655	Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .	0
7656	Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?	0
7657	Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .	0
7658	What ?	0
7659	I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...	0
7660	What is it ?	0
7661	Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .	0
7662	That makes you feel uncomfortable ?	0
7663	Yeah . we never do that in a public office .	0
7664	Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .	0
7665	I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .	0
7666	Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .	0
7667	Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?	6
7668	Yeah .	0
7669	Oh , I'm shocked .	6
7670	What courses did you take in college ?	0
7671	I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .	0
7672	Which course did you like best ?	0
7673	I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .	4
7674	Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?	0
7675	Certainly . What's the matter ?	0
7676	I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .	0
7677	Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .	0
7678	Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?	0
7679	That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .	0
7680	Is the service charged ?	0
7681	No . it's free .	0
7682	Really . I'll get a computer at once .	0
7683	We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?	4
7684	It ’ s so cool !	4
7685	Excuse me , is this seat taken ?	0
7686	I ’ m afraid this seat is taken .	0
7687	Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .	0
7688	You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?	0
7689	Thank you .	0
7690	I prefer potatoes to eggplants .	0
7691	I feel eggplants are more nutritious .	0
7692	But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .	0
7693	Oh , that's how you see it .	0
7694	Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?	0
7695	Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .	0
7696	It's a deal .	0
7697	Where do you plan to go this winter ?	0
7698	Alps , suppose .	0
7699	Oh , yes , you like skiing .	0
7700	Right .	0
7701	Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .	0
7702	You were showing respect and admiration for them .	0
7703	I wish I were a hero .	0
7704	Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?	0
7705	Is he really ?	6
7706	Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .	0
7707	Who is he marring ?	0
7708	A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .	0
7709	Have they set a date for the wedding ?	0
7710	Not yet .	0
7711	OK . Come back into the classroom , class .	0
7712	Does the class start again , Mam ?	0

7720	Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?	4
7721	Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on .	0
7722	Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?	6
7723	Yes , stones .	0
7724	well , I can ’ t just imagine it .	0
7725	Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?	0
7726	Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .	0
7727	Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .	0
7728	What a nice day !	4
7729	yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?	0
7730	great , let's go !	4
7731	hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .	4
7732	exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...	4
7733	yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !	0
7734	why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .	0
7735	are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?	6
7736	never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?	0
7737	yeah , I think so .	0
