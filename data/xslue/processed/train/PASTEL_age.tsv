4243	It may not have been worth their trouble.	2

4263	This speaker did not think it was possible due to our world leaders.	2
4264	The kids were having fun and the adults finally got to just watch the time roll by.	1

4287	I had never seen so many weirdos in such a close proximity.	2
4288	The berries and leaves showed how much detail the glass could hold.	3
4289	And the foyer provided a great natural light contrast to the more dim settings of the lounge.	2
4290	This parade was always a great time.	2
4291	The woman vocalist is gothic.	1
4292	And the little brother agreed to pose with his sister on her special day.	5

4325	And Spike sure loves Sparks.	5
4326	It didn't take long for me to spot the beautiful feminine yellow one across the room and soon enough I'm right in front of it gawking at its design.	2
4327	After the party was over, him and some friends had a few beers and talked about their next steps in life.	2
4328	The male in the movie had to stay focused.	2
4329	It's so called outside why am I still walking around.	3
4330	It takes different stages of running to win the race.	5
4331	As the plane flies over, the hot air balloon sits on the earth.	5
4332	The subject of the statues is up to interpretation.	1
4333	The finishing touch was seeing the horse drawn milk wagon in front of the local dairy.	5
4334	It was very tiring to be a fruit.	1

11281	The last one turned out perfect.	2
11282	People waited anxiously to see if they would receive the scholarship money.	1
11283	And finished under the delicate glow of the jellies.	2

11392	The dog was ready to go.	2
11393	I found a map in my Mother's closet, that she had clearly had for MANY years.	4
11394	Instead they decided to go to the fireworks.	2

11409	People love to travel by air lifts to see a magical fairground east of the beach.	1
11410	The bride talks to bridesmaids.	2
11411	Can you hear the bang.	2
11412	Although the sign said not to pick the flowers, the trees in the vicinity had flowered too, and we wondered if it would be bad form to use that loophole to gather their blooms.	4
11413	Before the race starts we are all huddled around a fire to get toasty preparing to get wet.	2
11414	The passengers passed through an interesting looking archway to see the garden beyond.	2

11454	While Clair was reading the notices it started to rain so she quickly ran toward home.	5
11455	We took our time looking at the statues.	2
