126136	Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas.  Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he's added on the talk page to the article we could move it back?	0.7325648878312128
572728	"Hi, I see that you agree that User:Dr Joe's edits are suspicious... his latest edit totally clinches it though, as he went to the article <url> and reverted my changes on it, exactly like Beckjord did one or twice in the past out of nowhere, and then made edit comments on his talk page and talk:Bigfoot about how ""my"" mythology article sucks and needs to be opposed. I was wondering if you could go undo his edit for me there?"	0.5960728622491052
621950	Given what I see there, Finlay, I would argue that Marnanel's work is derivative, and that nohat's only request for derivative works is that they be released under the GFDL, which it's my understanding that Marnanel's work is.  Is there a section I'm misreading?	0.6317992918985073

621480	Thanks. As an aside, since this did turn out to be factual, just very hard to source, do you think the community would countenance an unblock request from Blaabla if he accepted some strict unblock conditions (such as packing in the 'systemic bias' thing, discussing his edits in a less confrontational manner etc)?	0.727974545660327

188976	I reverted your changes to the section heads at <url>, because I believe that References (when the section contains nothing but book titles and page numbers) is better than Notes, and that Bibliography is the best alternative to References when that header is already in use. But I'm keen to find out what's actually recommended - is there room for my preference?	0.5750218910891909

622624	Alright, I don't like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it?	0.4536003598903099
621540	You are right, I apologize not doing so.  A different layout for the template could be interesting (perhaps even with names, or those delivered in person/by text) but I didn't quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks, right?	0.6719668362673447

600819	In fact, what I'd like to propose here is that we take a bit more control, establish some stricter edit warring restrictions, unprotect the page, slap up an edit notice, and enforce them with blocks so that people can get back to writing the article.

4767	I'm suspecting a bad charger; most home screen I've used turns itself on when you just plugged the device in or plugged the device out, if a bad charger somehow causes the device to think that it had just been plugged off and/or plugged on, it could cause the symptoms you're having. Have you tried with a different charger and different wall socket?	0.8356513189951125
