30576	She opened the presents that her loved ones had purchased for her daughter.	1
30577	Everyone put their stickers on Chris.	1
30578	After she grew up she moved away from the house and a sign was posted there.	1
30579	It was in Los Angeles.	1
30580	And the people admired their artwork.	1
30581	I was eager to test my new camera, but couldn't figure out how to zoom.	1
